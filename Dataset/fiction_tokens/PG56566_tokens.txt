returns
from
farthest
arch
and
highest
during
the
day
lord
attentions
to
julia
were
public
and
unremitting
while
the
infatuated
unhappy
edmund
witnessed
it
all
in
growing
sorrow
of
heart
had
he
then
he
asked
himself
already
yielded
to
a
passion
so
irrational
so
dishonourable
he
was
not
quite
so
so
base
had
he
not
always
loved
julia
loved
her
when
she
was
a
there
could
be
nothing
questionable
in
the
nature
of
his
attachment
he
had
sincerely
fondly
loved
her
julia
too
in
the
course
of
the
day
felt
a
little
uncomfortable
she
thought
that
notwithstanding
the
friendly
conversation
of
the
morning
edmund
some
how
did
not
seem
satisfied
he
was
not
cheerful
he
was
not
frank
and
obliging
as
usual
he
was
not
in
short
the
least
like
himself
could
it
be
that
he
fancied
he
had
been
but
coolly
received
on
his
return
frances
and
herself
used
always
to
make
such
rejoicing
when
he
came
home
but
that
was
when
they
were
children
and
yesterday
there
was
such
a
hurry
with
possibly
edmund
might
have
thought
it
proceeded
from
silly
pride
because
there
were
strangers
by
or
some
such
worthless
feeling
she
longed
for
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
him
kindly
on
the
subject
and
doing
away
with
such
an
idea
if
indeed
it
existed
but
he
now
rather
seemed
to
avoid
her
while
lady
susan
always
happened
to
be
speaking
to
him
just
when
she
was
intending
to
do
so
at
dinner
lord
borrowdale
handed
in
julia
for
lord
morven
appeared
to
think
it
necessary
to
resign
in
his
favour
not
so
henry
who
not
only
secured
the
place
on
the
other
side
of
our
heroine
but
contrived
to
engross
much
of
her
conversation
this
was
but
poor
consolation
to
edmund
it
argued
indifference
to
lord
borrowdale
certainly
but
then
henry
though
without
title
was
at
least
nearly
her
equal
in
birth
being
her
own
cousin
and
it
was
possible
that
she
might
be
attached
to
him
he
had
been
at
home
once
or
twice
when
it
had
not
been
in
power
to
return
his
observations
this
morning
might
have
been
prompted
by
jealousy
after
dinner
preparations
were
made
for
a
sail
on
the
lake
edmund
observed
lord
borrowdale
from
the
moment
they
left
the
house
eagerly
secure
to
himself
the
care
of
julia
he
however
walked
on
the
other
side
but
lady
susan
passing
them
as
they
arrived
at
the
place
of
embarkation
ran
on
the
alone
then
stopping
half
way
in
alarm
and
balancing
herself
with
difficulty
yet
refusing
the
aid
of
the
bargemen
she
called
on
captain
montgomery
for
his
assistance
declaring
he
was
the
only
person
who
understood
boats
and
that
she
should
not
consider
herself
safe
in
any
other
hands
the
gallant
captain
could
not
disobey
the
summons
nor
having
obeyed
it
avoid
continuing
his
especial
protection
to
the
lady
while
henry
coming
up
at
the
moment
drew
arm
over
his
with
all
the
freedom
of
cousinship
the
boats
after
crossing
the
lake
coasted
along
beneath
the
shade
of
trees
which
hung
from
the
steep
rocks
almost
into
the
water
while
the
bare
mountain
tops
towering
far
above
were
canopied
by
the
heavens
and
again
reflected
in
the
clear
lake
where
yet
another
sky
appeared
as
far
beneath
is
the
spot
exclaimed
jackson
try
the
effect
of
the
they
had
arrived
as
he
spoke
opposite
the
opening
to
a
little
valley
a
chain
of
stupendous
mountains
arose
on
either
side
and
one
of
a
conical
form
partly
shrouded
in
a
white
mist
which
had
rolled
up
from
the
lake
terminated
the
far
perspective
the
rowers
lay
on
their
oars
and
the
commenced
an
air
immediately
a
gigantic
voice
from
within
the
steep
side
of
the
nearest
mountain
took
it
up
the
next
joined
in
and
the
next
but
each
less
loud
till
the
receding
echoes
in
journeying
round
the
lake
reached
rugged
borrowdale
there
they
seemed
broken
off
for
some
seconds
but
soon
a
distant
clamour
arose
as
proceeding
from
the
thousand
mountain
tops
of
that
desolate
region
the
sounds
were
flung
further
and
nearer
then
succeeded
each
other
more
rapidly
then
became
slower
in
their
repeats
at
length
they
came
forth
again
and
continued
travelling
round
the
lake
on
the
opposite
side
but
now
increasing
in
loudness
as
they
once
more
approached
the
boats
and
loudest
when
they
reached
the
mountain
which
formed
the
second
portal
to
the
little
valley
already
described
and
in
front
of
the
opening
to
which
the
boats
still
lay
then
fainter
and
fainter
notes
proceeded
up
the
vale
and
at
length
at
its
furthest
extremity
died
away
altogether
after
a
pause
of
perfect
silence
to
ascertain
that
no
return
of
the
echoes
could
be
expected
julia
was
eagerly
called
upon
to
sing
she
asked
edmund
to
join
her
in
the
echo
duet
and
smiled
as
she
spoke
to
him
half
his
unhappiness
vanished
in
a
moment
and
the
song
commenced
the
tones
of
voice
were
full
and
firm
his
singing
however
derived
its
principal
charm
from
his
manner
which
had
in
it
so
much
of
truth
and
nature
that
you
could
almost
fancy
him
one
addressing
you
with
no
object
but
to
persuade
by
the
purport
of
his
words
while
the
mere
inflexions
of
the
voice
in
sympathising
with
that
purport
unconsciously
formed
themselves
into
varied
and
melodious
harmonies
as
for
voice
it
chanced
to
be
one
of
those
wonders
rare
as
the
blow
of
the
aloe
cultivation
had
of
course
not
been
spared
but
it
was
its
native
power
and
unexampled
compass
which
were
so
remarkable
its
variety
of
capabilities
too
delighted
for
in
soft
or
playful
passages
its
tones
had
as
we
have
somewhere
remarked
an
almost
infantine
sweetness
on
the
present
occasion
the
scenery
the
music
the
effect
of
the
echoes
all
were
inspirations
and
the
notes
which
escaped
from
her
lips
gradually
arose
till
imagination
could
fancy
them
travelling
on
above
the
clouds
and
the
listeners
felt
an
involuntary
impulse
to
look
upwards
as
in
pursuit
of
them
then
as
the
air
varied
the
voice
would
suddenly
fall
full
and
plump
on
the
truest
and
richest
harmonies
below
while
the
higher
tones
were
repeated
far
above
by
now
receding
now
approaching
echoes
soon
did
the
whole
wild
region
round
about
seem
peopled
by
invisible
beings
wandering
voices
called
from
every
pointed
crag
of
every
mountain
top
while
the
rock
near
which
the
boat
still
lay
appeared
to
contain
some
dark
enchanter
who
all
the
time
in
hurried
and
mysterious
accents
spoke
from
within
even
every
little
tufted
island
seemed
to
have
its
own
one
wild
inhabitant
for
each
from
some
projecting
point
or
hidden
bower
sent
forth
a
voice
however
faint
in
its
tone
or
inarticulate
in
its
utterance
enthusiasm
arose
so
high
that
she
not
only
exerted
every
power
of
her
extraordinary
voice
but
when
she
had
concluded
forgetting
how
considerable
a
part
she
had
borne
in
the
general
concert
she
cried
beautiful
in
absolute
extacy
at
the
echoes
beautiful
exclaimed
edmund
at
the
same
moment
meaning
probably
singing
but
certainly
not
his
own
beautiful
repeated
the
voice
of
thunder
from
within
the
adjacent
perpendicular
rock
beautiful
ran
along
the
invisible
orchestra
above
frances
could
keep
her
countenance
no
longer
at
the
of
the
performers
visible
and
invisible
she
laughed
out
and
a
merry
peal
from
all
the
echoes
followed
immediately
is
too
bad
cried
jackson
starting
to
the
great
endangering
of
the
boat
from
the
attitude
of
delighted
attention
in
which
he
had
since
the
commencement
of
the
song
remained
motionless
is
too
bad
to
break
up
the
delicious
spell
with
such
a
farce
as
this
the
sun
was
now
near
setting
a
homeward
course
was
therefore
proposed
and
the
breeze
being
favourable
a
sail
was
spread
which
not
only
greatly
assisted
the
rowers
but
added
much
to
the
picturesque
appearance
of
the
gay
barge
in
which
our
party
sat
as
quitting
its
coasting
position
it
dipped
like
a
white
winged
into
the
dark
bosom
of
the
lake
and
crossed
to
the
keswick
side
when
they
were
about
to
land
edmund
paused
a
moment
to
consider
whether
he
ought
not
to
leave
julia
to
the
care
of
lord
borrowdale
but
she
happened
at
the
moment
to
point
out
a
well
remembered
beneath
an
overhanging
bower
of
branches
reminding
him
how
often
he
had
rowed
frances
and
herself
to
the
spot
and
remarking
further
a
little
path
sometimes
discernible
among
the
trees
in
which
they
used
to
walk
such
are
the
important
events
which
change
the
resolves
of
lovers
he
gave
up
all
thoughts
of
the
sacrifice
he
had
meditated
hastened
to
assist
her
out
of
the
boat
and
as
she
stepped
on
the
beach
drew
the
hand
he
held
over
his
arm
and
walked
on
unconscious
of
an
accident
which
followed
immediately
and
which
we
shall
here
describe
the
hold
of
the
on
the
roots
of
a
stump
giving
way
the
boat
was
sent
for
a
few
moments
and
not
only
was
the
bargeman
who
stood
with
one
foot
on
the
edge
of
the
boat
and
the
other
on
a
projecting
piece
of
rock
precipitated
into
the
water
but
so
also
was
lord
borrowdale
who
was
at
the
instant
in
the
very
act
of
leaping
ashore
to
join
our
heroine
this
caused
such
immoderate
laughing
among
the
rest
of
the
gentlemen
and
so
much
pretty
terror
among
the
ladies
that
edmund
and
julia
were
not
missed
till
they
became
quite
separated
from
the
party
a
most
inviting
path
lay
before
them
which
after
ascending
for
a
time
descended
a
steep
and
wooded
slope
to
an
overarched
opening
through
the
trees
just
where
a
single
plank
crossed
a
little
stream
at
a
considerable
height
from
the
water
arrived
on
this
rustic
bridge
they
stood
the
beauty
of
the
scene
suspending
the
hand
of
edmund
which
he
had
laid
on
a
little
paling
gate
at
its
further
extremity
with
the
purpose
of
opening
it
as
it
formed
the
barrier
between
our
wanderers
and
a
fresh
cut
the
sun
was
so
low
in
the
horizon
that
the
little
mounds
of
grass
which
every
hand
was
hastily
throwing
up
for
the
night
at
the
far
end
of
the
meadow
cast
their
lengthened
shadows
across
half
its
extent
while
the
setting
beam
was
still
bronzing
their
tops
together
with
the
faces
garments
and
implements
of
the
rustic
groups
employed
around
them
at
the
same
moment
a
full
moon
just
rising
to
view
on
the
opposite
verge
of
the
heavens
was
glittering
through
the
branches
of
some
dark
firs
that
terminated
the
prospect
in
that
direction
julia
who
had
several
appropriate
speeches
ready
had
been
all
day
only
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
say
them
for
she
had
reasoned
herself
into
a
belief
that
it
would
be
dreadful
to
let
edmund
think
himself
neglected
for
newer
or
gayer
objects
but
some
how
all
this
preparation
had
made
a
thing
so
simple
in
itself
as
joking
edmund
for
being
affronted
seem
quite
awful
and
in
consequence
her
heart
was
beating
so
fast
that
she
was
waiting
for
it
to
stop
before
she
could
begin
to
speak
she
at
length
contrived
to
say
turning
and
offering
her
hand
but
the
foolish
fluttering
of
her
heart
redoubled
and
she
stopped
short
edmund
started
caught
the
offered
hand
and
puzzled
and
delighted
pressed
it
to
his
lips
she
laughed
blushed
and
drew
her
hand
away
see
edmund
you
are
silly
enough
to
be
quite
this
was
rather
an
unfortunate
choice
of
expression
for
edmund
colouring
to
excess
began
to
stammer
i
have
dare
say
you
think
continued
julia
who
had
no
suspicion
of
the
kind
of
jealousy
which
on
mention
of
the
word
had
presented
itself
to
dare
say
you
think
we
did
not
appear
as
glad
to
see
you
as
usual
when
you
arrived
so
by
surprise
yesterday
but
you
came
in
in
so
hurried
a
so
many
julia
again
stammered
edmund
am
sure
none
of
us
intended
to
be
unkind
continued
julia
less
glad
i
mean
of
your
safe
are
too
good
to
be
unkind
to
any
one
julia
said
edmund
with
a
sigh
julia
still
fancying
his
manner
seemed
strangely
dissatisfied
began
to
feel
offended
in
her
turn
and
a
rather
awkward
pause
followed
at
length
she
compelled
herself
to
make
another
effort
and
said
with
a
reasoning
can
not
suppose
edmund
that
any
of
your
friends
at
lodore
regard
you
less
merely
from
your
having
been
a
few
years
from
home
indeed
if
you
could
know
how
highly
both
grandmamma
and
jackson
always
speak
of
you
you
would
not
think
so
he
made
no
reply
for
it
was
neither
grandmamma
nor
jackson
that
he
was
thinking
of
believe
she
added
trying
to
laugh
really
was
all
i
had
heard
about
montgomery
the
gallant
captain
montgomery
which
made
me
find
it
so
difficult
to
imagine
edmund
who
used
to
play
with
frances
and
myself
here
in
these
woods
and
the
said
terrible
captain
fighting
the
french
and
destroying
the
turks
on
the
high
seas
one
and
the
same
person
employment
it
must
be
confessed
he
replied
with
a
faint
smile
mean
that
said
julia
really
edmund
i
think
she
added
gravely
have
made
you
apologies
enough
to
restore
any
reasonable
being
to
good
make
me
apologies
he
commenced
but
julia
as
she
turned
from
him
with
something
of
indignation
at
his
supposed
obstinacy
forgetting
the
narrow
plank
on
which
she
stood
slipped
her
foot
and
would
certainly
have
fallen
into
the
water
had
he
not
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
lifted
her
to
sure
footing
julia
partly
from
alarm
and
partly
from
the
previous
exertion
of
her
spirits
in
saying
so
much
was
a
good
deal
overcome
and
even
shed
tears
the
sight
of
these
threw
edmund
off
his
guard
to
heaven
julia
he
exclaimed
i
were
indeed
your
brother
entitled
to
the
happy
privilege
of
guarding
one
more
precious
than
life
from
every
danger
of
sheltering
one
dearer
than
happiness
every
sorrow
thunderstruck
at
his
own
rashness
he
ceased
a
smile
through
her
tears
was
reply
for
as
she
was
not
expecting
or
thinking
of
a
love
speech
she
understood
from
what
had
been
said
only
that
friendship
and
good
humour
were
restored
and
edmund
become
more
like
himself
a
long
silence
however
followed
when
julia
at
last
said
in
rather
a
hesitating
manner
and
at
the
same
time
with
an
effort
at
playfulness
and
i
have
always
called
you
brother
you
know
can
you
not
fancy
yourself
such
and
take
as
good
care
of
us
as
if
you
were
really
our
brother
this
was
a
trying
appeal
and
the
beating
of
heart
closer
to
which
he
imperceptibly
drew
arm
as
she
spoke
shewed
him
that
he
must
not
trust
himself
with
the
use
of
language
another
silence
therefore
followed
and
they
walked
slowly
on
in
a
little
time
edmund
as
if
thinking
aloud
gave
perhaps
unconscious
utterance
to
what
seemed
to
be
the
result
of
his
meditations
saying
no
can
not
be
required
of
me
to
root
out
the
permitted
affections
of
childhood
from
my
heart
were
too
impossible
unnatural
who
wishes
you
to
do
so
asked
his
companion
with
a
quickness
that
shewed
how
little
she
understood
his
feelings
at
this
moment
the
rest
of
the
party
came
in
sight
at
some
distance
and
edmund
as
if
fearful
of
interruption
turned
suddenly
round
and
in
hurried
and
agitated
accents
said
you
permit
me
to
feel
for
you
the
affection
of
a
brother
you
permit
me
you
say
to
evince
that
feeling
by
care
of
your
welfare
your
safety
your
happiness
should
i
ever
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
extend
to
what
may
seem
presumption
on
your
goodness
the
dear
the
sacred
do
not
do
not
utterly
condemn
me
he
paused
a
moment
for
breath
then
with
effort
recommenced
thus
family
is
the
home
of
all
my
affections
could
it
it
be
otherwise
yet
in
cherishing
those

so
natural
in

circumstances

inextinguishable

may
occur
moments

may
be

to

an
unconnected
a

stranger
here
the
joining
of
the
party
as
they
came
up
laughing
and
recounting
lord
adventure
put
an
end
to
this
dangerous
conference
its
results
however
coloured
the
future
destinies
of
both
the
young
people
if
edmund
had
previously
formed
safer
resolves
they
were
now
lost
in
the
belief
that
julia
was
in
no
danger
of
discovering
in
him
or
sharing
herself
any
sentiments
exceeding
the
bounds
of
that
friendship
which
it
was
under
the
circumstance
but
right
and
natural
should
subsist
between
them
while
any
deficiency
he
argued
with
himself
in
the
manifestation
of
brotherly
regard
on
his
part
would
require
the
very
explanation
it
was
his
duty
not
to
make
he
must
therefore
shew
her
every
silent
unpretending
affectionate
attention
every
mark
of
brotherly
regard
while
his
own
imprudent
passion
must
lie
for
ever
buried
in
his
own
bosom
he
must
indeed
correct
its
mad
and
wild
intensity
the
habit
of
being
in
her
society
would
he
hoped
assist
him
to
do
so
would
moderate
the
extraordinary
effect
that
society
now
had
upon
him
would
enable
him
to
sober
down
his
feelings
into
those
of
a
truly
affectionate
brother
really
solicitous
for
the
welfare
of
a
sister
he
sincerely
loves
chapter
ii
was
the
trembling
joy
of
my
soul
when
mine
eyes
lifted
to
seek
the
bounding
deer
have
met
thy
secret
gaze
mighty
king
fairest
among
thy
thousands
the
interview
described
in
the
concluding
pages
of
our
last
chapter
though
certainly
on
very
mistaken
grounds
a
kind
of
confidence
between
our
hero
and
her
who
had
ever
been
the
darling
of
his
childhood
banishing
the
momentary
estrangement
to
which
the
first
birth
of
a
still
fonder
attachment
had
given
rise
it
seemed
to
be
now
understood
on
both
sides
that
they
were
to
be
quite
brother
and
sister
and
accordingly
under
the
pleasing
illusion
edmund
henceforward
paid
and
julia
received
every
devotion
that
a
growing
and
blinding
passion
could
suggest
except
open
declaration
yet
did
confessions
pass
from
heart
to
heart
every
time
their
eyes
met
while
their
understandings
pretended
to
know
nothing
about
the
matter
for
each
of
them
took
care
not
to
ask
themselves
any
questions
on
the
subject
as
long
as
they
felt
so
perfectly
happy
as
they
now
did
in
each
society
even
the
attentions
of
lord
borrowdale
soon
almost
ceased
to
pain
edmund
he
could
distinctly
see
that
they
were
at
least
indifferent
if
not
annoying
to
julia
and
though
he
did
not
dare
to
ask
himself
why
the
conviction
was
a
source
of
infinite
joy
to
him
the
gay
mornings
of
the
regatta
dinner
company
every
day
and
dancing
every
evening
continued
for
some
time
while
the
very
public
attentions
of
his
said
lordship
towards
our
heroine
and
the
jest
or
as
it
is
technically
phrased
the
quiz
about
our
hero
and
lady
susan
tended
to
blind
every
one
to
the
growth
of
the
deep
rooted
attachment
which
was
thus
hourly
possessing
itself
of
every
feeling
and
faculty
of
heart
and
of
soul
in
julia
and
in
edmund
yet
still
were
they
brother
and
sister
and
in
their
own
opinion
behaving
with
the
greatest
prudence
for
love
was
not
once
mentioned
by
edmund
and
as
to
julia
she
never
even
thought
of
it
she
only
felt
it
good
how
amiable
it
is
of
julia
thought
edmund
be
so
kind
to
a
friendless
stranger
could
be
unkind
to
edmund
thought
julia
gentleness
of
his
manners
win
upon
one
so
the
expression
of
his
countenance
is
so
interesting
his
very
smile
is
so
nearly
allied
to
melancholy
that
any
one
with
the
least
feeling
must
dread
the
idea
of
causing
him
a
he
for
his
part
could
not
long
deceive
himself
as
to
the
nature
of
his
own
sentiments
but
he
thought
there
was
no
harm
in
cherishing
them
while
he
could
flatter
himself
that
because
he
was
not
declaring
he
was
concealing
them
or
had
he
thought
otherwise
the
temptation
was
perhaps
too
strong
to
be
resisted
he
could
not
be
blind
to
the
pleasure
with
which
julia
received
every
little
mark
of
silent
attention
from
him
and
the
blissful
sensation
which
glowed
within
his
breast
at
such
moments
was
not
to
be
foregone
at
the
faint
instigations
of
a
judgment
bewildered
by
the
influence
of
an
absorbing
passion
yet
he
certainly
fancied
that
it
was
only
his
own
futurity
he
was
sacrificing
for
a
dream
of
present
felicity
whatever
he
sometimes
to
be
he
undoubtedly
always
them
the
generous
friendship
she
had
promised
him
should
ever
be
his
and
he
thus
reasoned
with
himself
that
as
she
had
distinctly
permitted
him
to
feel
and
declare
a
affection
for
her
it
was
to
be
expected
that
she
would
receive
with
complacency
those
unpretending
marks
of
regard
which
belong
peculiarly
to
friendship
and
as
frances
was
often
even
more
openly
kind
in
her
manner
to
him
all
was
of
course
as
it
should
be
as
to
was
no
matter
about
himself
he
even
felt
a
kind
of
satisfaction
in
thinking
that
when
he
could
no
longer
enjoy
the
delirium
of
happiness
under
the
dominion
of
which
he
now
the
hour
of
separation
must
then
his
misery
should
be
as
wild
as
unlimited
as
his
felicity
was
now
still
would
he
watch
for
the
dangerous
smile
and
when
its
light
began
to
dawn
on
the
features
of
julia
he
would
have
opened
his
heart
to
its
intoxicating
influence
had
instantaneous
death
been
the
immediate
and
foreseen
consequence
she
often
observed
a
shade
of
melancholy
on
the
brow
of
edmund
but
she
also
observed
that
it
gave
way
to
sunny
joy
when
a
look
a
word
or
a
smile
of
hers
was
directed
towards
him
to
possess
the
power
of
giving
happiness
in
a
manner
so
easy
and
so
innocent
to
one
for
whom
she
did
not
deny
that
she
had
all
her
life
had
a
very
tender
sisterly
affection
to
possess
such
a
power
and
not
to
use
it
was
not
in
the
affectionate
nature
of
julia
she
did
exert
it
every
day
every
hour
and
when
she
saw
countenance
light
up
with
a
beam
caught
from
her
smile
she
felt
a
degree
of
pleasure
that
sometimes
startled
her
but
she
never
ventured
to
ask
herself
whether
or
not
all
this
was
to
lead
to
any
ultimate
results
sometimes
indeed
she
recollected
with
a
sensation
of
panic
that
edmund
must
again
leave
lodore
house
must
again
return
to
the
sea
to
hardships
to
dangers
and
then
she
would
strive
to
banish
the
scaring
thoughts
that
crowded
in
upon
her
but
the
next
time
she
addressed
edmund
there
would
be
a
tenderness
in
the
accents
of
her
voice
a
something
indefinable
in
the
expression
of
her
eyes
that
would
shake
his
whole
soul
to
its
foundation
bewilder
his
every
thought
undo
his
every
resolve
and
place
him
passive
as
it
were
in
the
hands
of
a
fate
at
once
too
overwhelming
and
too
delightful
to
be
resisted
meanwhile
the
whirl
of
gaiety
the
noise
of
merriment
was
still
going
on
around
them
frances
was
the
ringleader
of
the
quizzers
of
lady
susan
and
her
ladyship
evidently
liked
being
quizzed
so
that
frances
did
not
think
mercy
necessary
the
subject
did
not
amuse
julia
near
so
much
as
it
did
her
sister
but
then
julia
was
always
of
a
graver
cast
as
for
edmund
he
considered
the
whole
business
so
complete
a
jest
that
he
took
it
very
good
humouredly
and
received
lady
attentions
with
great
politeness
he
even
found
it
necessary
not
unfrequently
to
dance
with
her
ladyship
or
hand
her
in
or
out
of
a
room
a
carriage
or
a
boat
when
he
saw
that
she
had
actually
been
left
for
him
sometimes
too
he
coloured
and
looked
involuntarily
towards
julia
when
pert
young
ladies
told
him
that
they
looked
upon
him
as
no
better
than
a
married
man
he
coloured
too
and
more
deeply
when
men
told
him
that
faith
he
might
make
his
fortune
if
he
were
not
the
most
egregious
blockhead
in
existence
that
lady
susan
had
fifty
thousand
pounds
was
one
of
the
best
connexions
in
the
kingdom
and
a
very
pretty
young
woman
beside
a
thing
scarcely
to
be
looked
for
where
so
many
other
advantages
were
combined
even
montgomery
and
jackson
agreed
together
but
privately
that
edmund
was
fortunate
in
the
probability
there
was
of
his
making
so
desirable
a
match
they
determined
that
it
was
best
to
let
matters
take
their
course
and
not
to
say
anything
about
it
to
edmund
they
also
agreed
that
the
subject
was
much
too
delicate
to
be
mentioned
to
either
lord
or
lady
arandale
who
must
themselves
see
what
was
going
on
lord
and
lady
arandale
however
saw
only
that
their
daughter
flirted
a
little
a
thing
they
were
very
well
accustomed
to
see
for
the
quizzing
which
was
the
chief
part
of
the
business
was
of
course
kept
within
decorous
bounds
in
their
presence
julia
when
the
subject
was
long
dwelt
upon
by
others
sometimes
felt
not
quite
comfortable
without
however
asking
herself
why
and
this
uneasiness
slight
as
it
was
vanished
the
moment
she
met
the
eye
of
edmund
or
that
he
spoke
to
her
on
the
most
indifferent
topic
but
to
return
to
montgomery
and
jackson
they
were
so
extravagantly
partial
to
edmund
themselves
and
had
for
so
many
years
strengthened
each
other
in
the
belief
that
there
was
no
doubt
of
his
being
the
son
of
a
noble
family
no
doubt
in
short
of
the
truth
of
the
statements
in
the
letter
that
they
did
not
see
the
impropriety
of
a
match
between
him
and
lady
susan
in
the
glaring
light
in
which
it
would
have
been
viewed
by
most
others
they
thought
their
inward
conviction
that
his
birth
was
equal
to
her
when
joined
with
his
own
great
merit
his
amiability
in
private
and
high
standing
character
in
public
life
quite
sufficient
to
outweigh
the
trifling
circumstances
of
their
never
having
been
able
to
discover
exactly
who
he
was
and
of
his
having
no
property
but
his
pay
and
his
fifteen
thousand
pounds
what
montgomery
might
have
thought
of
all
this
had
the
subject
been
brought
nearer
home
by
the
knowledge
that
it
was
to
julia
edmund
was
attached
it
is
hard
to
say
for
the
best
of
us
can
seldom
judge
impartially
when
we
ourselves
or
those
we
love
are
concerned
there
are
few
mothers
who
do
not
expect
their
sons
to
marry
such
women
as
were
they
their
daughters
they
would
not
give
to
such
men
as
their
sons
but
montgomery
was
spared
all
alarm
respecting
the
intimacy
between
her
and
adopted
son
by
supposed
sudden
admiration
of
lady
susan
commencing
on
the
very
evening
of
his
arrival
and
the
fuss
as
we
before
observed
which
every
one
had
since
made
about
their
mutual
attachment
there
was
also
another
blind
to
penetration
in
the
marked
and
troublesome
attentions
of
henry
to
his
cousin
julia
beside
whom
he
was
generally
to
be
seen
while
edmund
by
the
contrivance
of
others
was
dancing
with
or
handing
about
lady
susan
montgomery
in
short
was
very
uneasy
about
it
and
even
lectured
her
nephew
on
the
subject
for
she
knew
how
disagreeable
such
a
thing
would
be
to
lord
lord
borrowdale
too
who
would
have
been
a
perfectly
eligible
match
was
equally
marked
in
his
attentions
yet
it
was
impossible
to
say
which
julia
preferred
she
generally
smiled
and
looked
happy
and
this
was
all
that
could
be
ascertained
the
lovers
the
while
strange
to
say
had
taken
no
alarm
if
we
except
first
day
or
two
of
endless
fears
since
which
a
tacit
and
to
themselves
unacknowledged
conviction
of
each
affection
had
grown
up
in
the
heart
of
each
keeping
peace
within
in
spite
of
all
outward
occurrences
the
miseries
of
doubt
the
tortures
of
alternate
hopes
and
fears
were
alas
reserved
for
a
future
stage
of
their
attachment
edmund
indeed
was
a
little
disturbed
one
day
by
asking
him
which
he
thought
julia
received
with
most
favour
the
attentions
of
lord
borrowdale
or
those
of
her
cousin
adding
how
much
she
disapproved
of
conduct
in
the
business
and
requesting
that
edmund
when
they
returned
on
board
would
give
him
leave
of
absence
as
seldom
as
possible
continued
the
old
lady
have
heard
many
sensible
people
say
that
the
sympathy
which
cousins
naturally
feel
towards
each
other
as
relatives
is
very
apt
to
become
love
or
what
is
just
as
mischievous
in
its
consequences
to
be
mistaken
for
it
if
young
persons
are
allowed
to
be
too
much
together
now
lord
borrowdale
though
a
match
of
which
her
father
would
perfectly
approve
is
not
you
know
near
so
handsome
as
henry
who
certainly
has
she
added
with
a
sigh
great
look
of
poor
she
next
adverted
but
slightly
having
determined
not
to
discuss
the
point
at
present
to
own
prospects
with
respect
to
lady
susan
he
had
either
fallen
into
a
reverie
or
he
thought
the
subject
too
ridiculous
to
be
treated
seriously
for
he
merely
said
with
an
air
of
great
indifference
and
in
reply
to
more
than
one
hitherto
unanswered
observation
of
that
you
know
can
never
be
any
thing
but
a
immediately
after
however
changing
his
manner
he
broke
forth
into
an
energetic
and
almost
passionate
speech
on
the
impossibility
of
one
situated
as
he
was
one
who
had
no
home
no
country
no
kindred
who
knew
not
to
what
rank
in
society
he
belonged
who
had
not
even
a
name
but
by
courtesy
and
who
therefore
could
not
bestow
one
ever
thinking
of
marrying
any
being
however
dearly
however
fondly
cherished
their
idea
might
be
to
the
latest
moment
of
existence
all
this
was
said
with
much
feeling
for
julia
was
in
every
thought
while
montgomery
heard
in
it
no
denial
of
his
attachment
to
lady
susan
but
on
the
contrary
an
implied
confession
of
how
much
he
regretted
the
obstacles
which
stood
in
the
way
of
their
union
she
was
beginning
to
say
something
intended
to
raise
her
desponding
favourite
a
little
in
his
own
opinion
when
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
lord
borrowdale
edmund
left
the
room
half
awakened
from
his
dream
of
bliss
and
therefore
far
from
happy
the
uneasy
feeling
however
lasted
but
till
he
had
found
julia
met
her
eye
and
seen
her
smile
and
then
vanished
with
a
celerity
which
none
can
understand
but
those
who
have
felt
the
powerful
internal
evidence
a
look
can
convey
chapter
iii
moves
thy
spirit
thus
julia
often
happened
to
walk
out
before
breakfast
sometimes
frances
was
with
her
and
sometimes
not
but
edmund
always
happened
to
join
her
one
morning
the
three
were
walking
together
the
sisters
with
their
usual
friendly
familiarity
leaning
each
on
an
arm
of
our
hero
whom
they
always
treated
as
a
brother
when
frances
began
in
a
laughing
manner
to
ask
him
how
soon
his
marriage
with
lady
susan
was
to
take
place
edmund
tried
to
smile
but
sighed
very
heavily
so
it
is
really
serious
cried
frances
julia
too
commenced
a
sort
of
sigh
but
as
soon
as
she
was
aware
that
she
had
done
so
she
closed
her
lips
that
the
breath
might
descend
without
sound
edmund
on
whom
as
we
have
just
observed
she
was
leaning
felt
the
slight
movement
and
was
strangely
gratified
not
that
he
presumed
to
assign
any
cause
to
the
sigh
know
frances
he
said
in
reply
to
the
question
about
lady
susan
business
is
completely
a
jest
i
wonder
by
the
bye
her
ladyship
is
not
offended
at
being
made
the
subject
of
a
jest
but
were
it
otherwise
he
continued
with
solemnity
she
indeed
the
object
of
an
overwhelming
she
indeed
the
being
whose
looks
whose
words
whose
smile
gave
value
to
each
moment
of
she
in
short
the
object
of
a
which
you
know
they
say
can
not
be
torn
up
without
carrying
with
it
the
very
fibres
of
the
heart
itself
and
leaving
it
incapable
of
future
energy
i
do
not
say
that
i
should
attempt
to
eradicate
the
sentiment
no
i
should
cherish
its
very
miseries
as
preferable
far
to
the
barren
waste
the
joyless
void
of
a
heart
weaned
from
love
but
such
feelings
whatever
it
might
cost
me
to
suppress
them
should
never
be
permitted
to
pass
my
lips
while
mystery
hung
over
my
may
you
not
be
loved
for
your
own
sake
edmund
whoever
you
are
said
frances
for
the
sake
of
the
high
character
you
have
established
for
yourself
as
jackson
says
i
am
sure
i
could
not
love
you
better
nor
grandmamma
nor
julia
nor
jackson
if
you
turned
out
to
be
the
eldest
son
of
his
majesty
and
rightful
heir
to
the
throne
of
great
britain
edmund
looked
round
involuntarily
towards
julia
but
her
eyes
were
on
the
ground
hope
frances
he
said
in
a
mournful
tone
i
shall
always
possess
the
kind
regard
of
the
friends
you
have
named
this
hope
indeed
is
and
ever
must
be
the
only
solace
of
my
isolated
and
in
all
other
respects
hopeless
existence
speak
that
way
edmund
you
make
me
quite
melancholy
said
frances
the
tears
starting
into
her
eyes
as
she
held
out
her
hand
which
edmund
snatched
and
kissed
said
julia
in
a
tremulous
tone
in
which
was
something
of
reproach
she
looked
up
for
a
moment
as
she
spoke
and
edmund
saw
the
glistening
of
tears
in
her
eyes
also
am
sure
he
said
every
thing
that
is
noble
every
thing
that
is
generous
every
thing
that
is
last
word
edmund
said
julia
interrupting
him
more
like
the
language
of
the
friend
you
ought
to
feel
yourself
among
said
frances
continuing
the
former
part
of
the
subject
and
jackson
you
know
think
it
quite
certain
that
you
are
the
son
of
a
noble
all
is
mystery
he
replied
mournfully
as
his
thoughts
reverted
to
the
disgraceful
possibility
which
had
of
late
haunted
his
imagination
that
of
his
being
yet
proved
the
child
of
criminal
though
perhaps
of
titled
parents
short
he
continued
being
such
as
i
am
must
drag
out
existence
a
solitary
wanderer
unconnected
with
any
but
by
the
ties
of
charity
of
after
a
pause
which
neither
of
the
sisters
had
voice
to
interrupt
he
frances
must
soon
again
call
me
from
the
too
happy
dream
i
have
lately
enjoyed
sometimes
indeed
in
an
hour
of
peace
i
may
i
shall
return
to
happy
happy
lodore
the
dear
paradise
of
my
childhood
and
from
the
generous
friendship
there
granted
me
derive
gleams
of
felicity
snatches
of
a
joy
that
will
render
the
rest
of
life
perhaps
more
he
was
silent
a
few
seconds
then
added
so
precious
will
such
moments
ever
be
to
me
that
i
shall
hold
them
cheaply
purchased
by
the
dreary
wretchedness
that
must
precede
and
follow
them
tears
flowed
silently
too
were
again
starting
into
her
eyes
edmund
said
the
latter
is
something
more
than
usual
in
the
matter
this
love
this
first
love
that
you
speak
of
so
feelingly
i
fear
is
a
serious
business
after
all
for
you
never
were
in
love
before
i
suppose
but
indeed
you
need
not
grieve
so
much
for
i
have
no
right
perhaps
to
betray
such
a
am
perfectly
certain
you
will
not
be
sake
what
are
you
talking
of
frances
exclaimed
edmund
colouring
excessively
while
julia
turned
deadly
pale
am
saying
replied
frances
i
am
sure
lady
susan
will
not
refuse
you
she
thinks
susan
repeated
edmund
in
a
voice
of
disappointment
certainly
never
will
frances
he
added
i
shall
never
have
the
folly
or
the
presumption
to
put
it
in
her
power
to
do
so
you
know
i
have
just
explained
to
you
that
i
can
never
i
may
say
never
for
it
would
indeed
be
wildly
romantic
to
hope
that
i
ever
shall
be
enabled
even
to
seek
to
do
so
consistently
with
honour
and
my
the
word
is
too
inadequate
and
were
i
by
the
most
circumstances
placed
at
i
vanity
you
are
leading
me
on
to
speak
too
much
of
myself
frances
which
is
always
you
know
a
dangerous
as
well
as
an
unbecoming
he
ceased
and
all
three
walked
on
for
a
time
in
silence
at
length
julia
said
in
a
low
should
it
grieve
you
so
much
edmund
not
marry
i
think
there
is
any
occasion
for
every
one
to
be
married
now
intend
to
edmund
started
and
looked
round
julia
he
said
she
continued
dropping
her
eyelids
am
very
happy
and
here
a
sigh
contradicted
her
assertion
the
friends
i
have
loved
all
my
your
long
long
life
ejaculated
edmund
with
a
smile
and
a
sigh
i
can
not
imagine
continued
julia
now
to
love
a
stranger
or
suppose
any
thing
so
absurd
as
the
possibility
of
setting
up
a
new
image
in
my
heart
to
be
worshipped
above
all
that
have
hitherto
inhabited
there
oh
no
that
indeed
can
never
interrupted
frances
laughing
are
to
understand
that
there
is
an
old
set
up
there
already
a
first
love
i
suppose
as
edmund
calls
it
is
it
then
his
lordship
or
our
amiable
and
interesting
cousin
it
would
indeed
be
a
charity
to
love
him
for
i
am
sure
no
one
else
you
know
frances
mean
own
friends
said
julia
ask
yourself
could
you
ever
love
a
stranger
as
you
love
those
you
have
loved
all
your
life
as
you
love
me
for
instance
stranger
said
frances
considering
certainly
not
while
the
stranger
continued
to
be
a
henry
you
know
is
no
stranger
so
one
of
my
guesses
may
be
right
or
perhaps
you
like
edmund
am
sure
i
edmund
had
remained
perfectly
silent
for
a
few
seconds
he
had
actually
been
stunned
by
the
extacy
of
an
irresistible
conviction
that
julia
was
saying
as
plainly
as
words
could
express
it
that
she
loved
him
and
that
she
never
would
or
could
love
any
one
else
but
on
her
appeal
to
frances
in
reply
to
the
interruption
of
the
latter
his
short
lived
transport
faded
alludes
to
the
gentle
ties
of
relationship
said
he
to
himself
having
known
no
feeling
but
that
of
calm
and
gradually
formed
affection
she
can
not
even
imagine
any
a
momentary
pang
indeed
shot
across
his
heart
as
frances
alluded
to
henry
for
julia
might
have
loved
him
all
her
life
if
she
loved
him
at
all
but
he
was
not
as
frances
observed
a
character
very
likely
to
inspire
love
then
her
manner
the
expression
of
her
eyes
the
tones
of
her
voice
how
different
when
she
addressed
himself
from
what
they
were
when
addressing
her
cousin
this
was
however
a
subject
not
to
be
too
closely
examined
though
it
served
for
the
present
to
banish
all
painful
thoughts
respecting
henry
talk
you
know
said
frances
love
at
first
sight
replied
julia
people
must
either
have
no
real
friends
and
therefore
no
real
affections
or
be
themselves
incapable
of
feeling
a
real
attachment
do
you
call
a
real
attachment
asked
frances
one
founded
all
life
known
that
loves
unites
every
quality
that
is
noble
and
estimable
not
only
in
own
opinion
replied
julia
blushing
deeper
and
deeper
at
each
word
in
that
of
those
whose
judgment
one
respects
with
all
that
is
gentle
kind
and
amiable
towards
oneself
edmund
felt
an
almost
irresistible
desire
to
press
her
hand
as
she
said
this
nor
could
he
be
quite
certain
that
he
did
not
do
so
was
jackson
she
added
in
a
hurried
manner
was
explaining
the
subject
the
other
day
he
said
you
know
frances
that
it
was
because
we
are
formed
to
find
perfect
happiness
hereafter
in
loving
absolute
perfection
that
we
experience
so
much
delight
in
attaching
ourselves
in
this
life
to
what
on
earth
comes
nearest
to
perfection
and
what
can
we
know
of
the
perfections
of
a
stranger
not
till
we
discover
them
replied
frances
then
should
they
prove
greater
than
those
of
our
older
acquaintances
by
your
own
argument
of
loving
best
what
comes
nearest
to
perfection
the
stranger
must
deserve
and
obtain
our
impossible
exclaimed
julia
is
impossible
asked
frances
julia
made
no
answer
and
frances
after
a
moment
or
two
of
silence
enquired
of
edmund
if
the
lancer
whom
they
had
observed
driving
his
curricle
round
the
lake
yesterday
evening
were
the
same
they
had
seen
at
the
regatta
edmund
looked
in
her
face
without
meaning
or
reply
his
thoughts
had
been
too
differently
employed
to
be
so
easily
brought
to
bear
on
the
identity
of
a
lancer
see
said
frances
is
thinking
of
his
first
love
we
ought
not
to
tease
him
with
questions
on
less
interesting
subjects
i
have
been
considering
about
it
edmund
she
continued
i
can
not
see
what
harm
it
would
be
for
you
to
be
married
to
lady
susan
when
it
would
make
you
both
susan
repeated
edmund
am
not
thinking
about
lady
susan
i
assure
you
frances
said
a
soft
voice
from
behind
followed
by
immoderate
laughter
from
several
persons
our
trio
looked
round
and
beheld
lady
susan
herself
accompanied
by
lord
borrowdale
lord
morven
and
henry
have
caught
the
gallant
captain
speaking
of
your
ladyship
at
least
observed
lord
borrowdale
in
my
opinion
argues
thinking
added
henry
edmund
not
knowing
well
how
to
get
out
of
the
scrape
joined
the
laugh
and
said
he
believed
he
must
plead
what
he
left
it
to
the
imagination
of
his
accusers
to
determine
lady
susan
seemed
to
think
it
was
of
being
in
love
and
that
with
herself
for
she
smiled
addressed
our
hero
frequently
and
was
particularly
obliging
to
him
all
the
morning
lord
morven
who
did
not
seem
much
to
relish
the
scene
asked
without
addressing
any
one
in
particular
who
that
dashing
fellow
was
who
drove
along
the
margin
of
the
lake
yesterday
evening
as
they
were
boating
same
answered
lord
borrowdale
made
himself
so
conspicuous
during
the
regatta
splashing
through
the
crowd
in
his
am
aware
of
that
rejoined
lord
morven
i
mean
to
enquire
if
any
one
knows
who
the
young
man
is
no
one
i
believe
can
make
out
the
name
is
beaumont
but
he
has
not
brought
any
introductions
and
has
i
understand
declined
the
acquaintance
of
some
persons
who
taking
it
for
granted
that
he
was
of
the
noble
family
of
that
name
wished
to
call
on
is
not
then
it
would
seem
very
consistent
said
henry
he
literally
scraped
an
acquaintance
the
other
day
with
such
a
fellow
as
lawson
my
man
of
business
for
the
express
purpose
of
asking
to
be
introduced
at
lodore
shows
his
good
taste
said
lord
borrowdale
with
an
appropriate
glance
towards
the
group
of
ladies
appears
observed
lord
morven
have
a
tolerable
taste
in
most
things
his
horses
are
beautiful
animals
and
his
dogs
the
finest
i
have
seen
he
not
rather
himself
too
asked
frances
thought
so
as
well
as
one
could
see
passing
did
not
you
think
so
lady
susan
i
did
not
look
at
him
replied
her
ladyship
glancing
at
edmund
said
henry
with
a
sneer
fellow
drives
about
to
some
purpose
it
would
a
most
enviable
one
certainly
remarked
the
lord
of
borrowdale
can
any
one
tell
what
brought
him
into
this
neighbourhood
asked
lord
morven
were
obliged
answered
lord
borrowdale
send
from
whitehaven
to
carlisle
for
military
to
quell
a
very
serious
riot
of
colliers
headed
too
it
seems
by
one
of
the
fair
sex
who
i
understand
leads
her
party
in
fashion
of
an
equestrian
amazon
and
who
had
they
say
proceeded
in
triumph
through
every
street
in
whitehaven
terrified
the
poor
quiet
magistrates
overturned
the
carts
of
potatoes
going
down
to
the
shipping
for
exportation
and
in
short
lorded
it
over
the
whole
population
till
the
arrival
of
the
very
well
he
plays
the
flute
said
frances
said
henry
what
good
care
he
took
to
keep
his
boat
within
hearing
of
our
party
these
several
evenings
on
the
dare
say
it
was
quite
by
accident
rejoined
frances
how
picturesque
the
effect
was
she
continued
turning
to
lady
susan
the
little
skiff
with
its
one
white
sail
appearing
and
disappearing
round
points
of
rock
the
one
reclining
figure
playing
on
the
flute
the
two
dogs
seated
one
on
each
side
listening
with
profound
attention
till
at
some
dying
cadence
pointing
their
noses
upward
they
would
utter
a
long
and
piteous
wail
while
the
rapt
musician
himself
seemed
unconscious
not
only
of
their
wild
accompaniment
and
that
of
all
the
echoes
far
and
near
but
even
of
his
own
thought
himself
a
perfect
hero
of
romance
i
have
no
doubt
replied
her
ladyship
cried
frances
do
not
think
there
was
any
appearance
of
affectation
about
he
is
rejoined
henry
had
better
not
wander
about
these
woods
in
his
long
feathers
or
i
shall
be
apt
to
shoot
him
in
mistake
for
a
you
had
better
take
care
what
you
do
said
frances
are
much
too
fond
let
me
tell
you
of
killing
of
every
of
shooting
what
have
you
done
with
that
fine
setter
of
yours
aubin
asked
lord
morven
him
for
sake
rascal
leaped
up
on
me
with
his
dirty
feet
after
i
was
dressed
for
dinner
the
other
shame
henry
exclaimed
both
the
sisters
at
the
same
moment
bad
faith
cried
the
gentlemen
frances
began
to
tell
henry
that
nobody
would
ever
love
him
he
was
so
wicked
he
affected
to
laugh
and
whispered
julia
as
he
passed
loud
enough
however
for
edmund
who
was
on
the
other
side
to
hear
do
say
to
that
julia
at
the
same
time
accompanying
his
words
with
an
insidious
look
of
tender
confiding
enquiry
she
was
astonished
but
had
not
presence
of
mind
to
reply
and
even
edmund
at
the
time
only
thought
henry
impertinent
the
party
had
now
arrived
in
front
of
the
house

while
the
modest
pearl
blends
its
moonlight
lustre
with
the
sunny
while
all
were
taking
their
places
at
the
breakfast
table
lady
susan
was
so
obliging
in
making
room
for
every
one
that
at
last
she
found
herself
seated
next
to
our
hero
but
alas
julia
was
on
his
other
side
to
do
him
justice
however
he
helped
her
ladyship
abundantly
too
abundantly
indeed
to
many
things
she
did
not
want
he
even
had
the
unparalleled
generosity
to
offer
her
and
that
with
a
sudden
start
of
recollection
his
cup
of
tea
when
she
had
one
of
her
own
he
also
turned
and
begged
her
pardon
more
than
once
when
it
was
not
to
him
she
had
addressed
herself
see
whispered
lord
borrowdale
who
for
lack
of
room
near
julia
had
seated
himself
on
the
other
side
of
lady
susan
montgomery
is
so
bewildered
by
the
radiance
of
your
smiles
that
he
actually
does
not
know
what
he
is
lady
susan
sighed
and
smiled
and
tried
to
be
of
his
opinion
the
following
plan
which
had
been
in
agitation
ever
since
the
arrival
of
the
arandales
at
lodore
house
was
now
finally
arranged
in
short
montgomery
after
many
objections
at
length
consented
to
her
accompanying
their
family
back
to
ayrshire
for
about
a
month
captain
montgomery
and
aubin
were
invited
to
join
the
party
the
euphrasia
being
still
in
dock
our
hero
quickly
assented
to
a
proposal
by
which
he
was
to
enjoy
a
continuance
of
society
exclaimed
frances
on
receiving
a
message
from
a
servant
poor
little
friend
gotterimo
oh
may
we
have
him
in
grandmamma
it
will
be
so
amusing
i
dare
say
every
body
will
buy
something
from
him
added
julia
is
i
believe
a
deserving
poor
creature
said
montgomery
we
gratify
the
girls
and
admit
him
she
added
turning
to
lady
arandale
lady
arandale
of
course
assented
and
orders
were
given
accordingly
a
young
man
of
a
neat
diminutive
figure
now
entered
his
eyes
sparkled
with
hope
at
the
sight
of
so
large
a
company
while
at
the
same
time
a
kind
of
bashfulness
flushed
his
cheek
and
flurried
his
manner
the
girls
saw
this
and
felt
for
him
will
you
open
the
boxes
on
this
table
gotterimo
said
julia
and
while
he
was
doing
so
she
observed
that
when
the
first
flush
called
up
by
his
entrance
went
down
the
poor
countenance
assumed
an
anxious
and
saddened
expression
hope
she
added
had
good
success
in
bath
madam
he
answered
with
some
hesitation
then
added
was
first
year
ting
must
have
begin
this
led
to
further
enquiries
and
a
dismal
tale
of
having
been
robbed
by
his
partner
of
the
savings
of
his
whole
life
our
breakfast
party
felt
much
commiseration
for
poor
gotterimo
and
commenced
making
purchases
as
a
means
of
affording
at
least
temporary
assistance
the
sale
of
his
goods
raised
the
spirits
of
our
poor
little
friend
who
soon
became
all
activity
in
displaying
and
eloquence
in
recommending
each
shining
article
in
his
sparkling
collection
a
chain
was
admired
by
edmund
for
its
resemblance
to
a
cable
and
was
purchased
by
julia
lord
eye
accidentally
fell
on
a
musical
box
gotterimo
set
the
air
playing
immediately
it
not
rather
slow
in
the
time
said
the
earl
de
slow
time
it
do
make
listen
should
prefer
something
less
dismal
said
his
lordship
sir
de
quick
time
it
do
make
dance
and
while
he
spoke
with
nimble
fingers
he
was
winding
up
a
curious
seal
which
now
began
to
execute
a
more
lively
air
is
pretty
said
the
earl
gotterimo
proffered
the
seal
to
his
lordship
articulation
of
the
box
is
superior
observed
lady
susan
be
more
superior
cried
gotterimo
presenting
the
box
to
her
ladyship

the
prettier
thing
persisted
lord
arandale

gotterimo
offering

the
little

enquiringly
then
rallying

and
he
added
smiling
sheepishly
ting

fen

gotterimo
de
money
this
was
logic
not
to
be
resisted
and
the
earl
took
both
together
with
watches
seals
and
chains
for
three
or
four
absent
nephews
while
lady
arandale
selected
handsome
presents
for
as
many
absent
nieces
thus
went
on
a
brisk
sale
of
poor
goods
when
montgomery
happening
to
cast
her
eye
over
the
contents
of
one
of
the
jewel
boxes
which
lay
open
her
attention
was
fixed
by
a
curious
mosaic
ring
she
caught
it
up
and
examined
it
with
a
much
deeper
interest
than
it
seemed
to
merit
gotterimo
believing
she
was
admiring
the
workmanship
of
the
article
silently
undid
the
clasps
of
a
small
morocco
case
and
placed
it
open
before
her
it
contained
the
set
of
mosaics
to
which
the
ring
belonged
her
countenance
changed
and
julia
remarked
that
movement
of
her
head
which
always
indicated
strong
emotion
montgomery
turned
the
centre
medallion
on
the
back
part
of
the
gold
rim
was
engraved
maria
her
name
and
the
mark
by
which
they
used
to
distinguish
between
their
necklaces
she
turned
deadly
pale
and
was
only
prevented
sinking
to
the
ground
by
the
united
support
of
julia
edmund
and
frances
the
moment
montgomery
recovered
she
called
for
gotterimo
and
enquired
anxiously
where
when
and
how
those
ornaments
had
come
into
his
possession
be
second
hand
madam
he
replied
have
buy
dem
of
a
gentleman
in
the
name
gotterimo
could
not
immediately
call
to
mind
he
had
seen
the
person
in
question
but
once
in
reply
to
the
question
of
what
sort
of
looking
gentleman
the
person
was
he
said
vos
tall
and
good
look

he
no

our
little
jeweller
however
offered
to

de

the
purchase
of

been
lately

but
all
that
gotterimo
knew

all
now
remembered
to
have
read
a
recent
account
in
the
papers
of
the
said
swindler
and
his
associates
with
their
assumed
names
the
mosaics
were
purchased
and
gotterimo
after
receiving
considerable
charitable
donations
dismissed
while
agitation
of
spirits
was
at
length
in
some
degree
composed
by
reminding
her
that
the
necklace
must
have
been
parted
with
many
years
ago
by
those
of
whom
she
thought
and
that
its
having
since
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
knot
of
swindlers
was
by
no
means
a
remarkable
circumstance
chapter
the
shadowy
margin
of
the
lake
in
a
spot
that
noise
be
the
bagpipes
said
frances
to
julia
trying
to
look
from
an
upper
window
in
one
of
the
turrets
of
arandale
castle
but
no
object
immediately
near
the
building
could
be
discerned
from
windows
situated
as
were
those
of
this
apartment
the
more
removed
prospect
however
was
rich
and
magnificent
woods
which
seemed
interminable
every
where
met
the
eye
with
here
and
there
an
opening
among
their
ranges
displaying
a
grassy
avenue
which
ran
along
till
lost
again
in
the
far
perspective
of
grove
meeting
grove
in
some
of
those
avenues
stood
herds
of
deer
looking
around
them
with
an
air
of
the
most
stately
security
in
others
even
hares
and
rabbits
were
sometimes
seen
to
venture
from
under
cover
cross
a
path
and
disappear
again
whilst
innumerable
cawing
rooks
continually
passing
and
repassing
each
heavy
flight
hovered
over
all
the
summits
of
the
trees
and
in
their
branches
sat
gay
plumed
peacocks
uttering
from
time
to
time
their
wild
cry
to
complete
the
picture
one
of
the
grassy
avenues
already
described
terminated
in
a
smooth
still
sheet
of
water
an
arm
of
which
was
crossed
at
a
considerable
height
by
a
light
bridge
of
iron
work
while
on
its
glassy
surface
sailed
two
snow
white
swans
the
sole
visible
inhabitants
of
this
their
watery
realm
is
the
bagpipes
my
lady
said
alice
smyth
housekeeper
told
me
to
tell
your
ladyships
that
that
was
the
way
your
ladyships
would
know
when
breakfast
was
ready
the
old
piper
walks
up
and
down
under
the
windows
playing
highland
tunes
all
the
time
of
breakfast
which
my
lady
arandale
makes
herself
every
day
at
ten
and
never
waits
for
any
body
but
sends
all
away
again
at
eleven
let
who
will
or
will
not
come
does
her
ladyship
make
no
allowance
for
the
first
morning
after
a
long
journey
said
frances
for
they
had
all
arrived
at
arandale
but
the
night
before
declare
my
limbs
are
quite
stiff
but
we
had
better
make
haste
or
by
account
we
shall
have
no
breakfast
she
continued
taking
her
arm
as
they
passed
along
the
galleries
above
and
across
the
halls
below
numerous
domestics
pointed
out
in
silence
the
way
to
the
breakfast
room
on
their
entrance
a
general
move
took
place
among
the
gentlemen
though
only
the
family
party
each
offered
or
pointed
out
a
seat
or
seats
it
so
happened
that
julia
took
one
offered
by
edmund
who
seated
himself
beside
her
and
began
silently
placing
within
her
reach
every
thing
she
could
possibly
want
lady
arandale
sat
at
the
head
lady
susan
at
the
foot
of
a
long
table
the
one
filled
tea
the
other
coffee
and
in
the
intermediate
space
appeared
the
usual
hot
rolls
toast
eggs
etc
of
an
english
breakfast
reinforced
by
the
scottish
addition
of
crisp
leaves
of
oaten
cake
thin
as
writing
paper
together
with
comfits
marmalade
and
all
sorts
of
sweetmeats
lord
morven
presided
at
a
side
table
abundantly
covered
with
savoury
pies
cold
meats
and
dried
fish
while
lord
arandale
seemed
to
have
the
sole
possession
of
a
third
and
lesser
one
where
he
alone
was
eating
of
a
certain
preparation
of
oatmeal
called
in
scotland
porridge
have
quite
forsaken
your
post
captain
montgomery
said
lady
susan
beg
a
thousand
pardons
exclaimed
edmund
starting
up
thought
i
had
filled
all
the
replied
her
ladyship
in
a
tone
of
much
pique
pray
be
seated
then
affecting
a
laugh
and
closing
her
eyelids
quickly
once
or
twice
to
disperse
a
tear
that
might
else
have
betrayed
her
mortification
she
added
did
not
then
let
me
inform
you
fill
even
one
nay
do
pray
sit
down
she
continued
as
edmund
made
another
attempt
to
rise
have
completed
my
task
with
very
little
fatigue
i
assure
you
though
you
were
so
much
shocked
at
the
idea
of
my
undertaking
lord
morven
a
wing
of
pigeon
suspended
on
his
fork
looked
round
at
his
sister
with
a
broad
and
silent
stare
she
blushed
and
addressed
successively
henry
frances
and
colonel
morven
without
waiting
for
an
answer
from
any
of
them
edmund
coloured
and
julia
who
had
neither
been
addressed
nor
accused
but
by
her
own
conscience
coloured
also
lord
arandale
having
dispatched
his
first
course
joined
the
general
table
to
finish
his
repast
with
some
of
the
good
things
it
afforded
plans
of
amusement
for
the
day
now
became
the
general
topic
julia
and
frances
begged
that
they
might
be
permitted
to
explore
some
of
the
beauties
of
the
grounds
which
from
their
windows
promised
so
much
lady
susan
proposed
a
visit
to
her
cottage
it
was
one
of
those
imitations
of
a
real
rustic
habitation
which
situated
in
some
delightful
retirement
in
the
midst
of
extensive
pleasure
grounds
were
the
fashionable
playthings
of
the
great
young
ladies
of
the
day
a
spinning
wheel
was
always
a
part
of
the
furniture
and
a
proficiency
in
its
use
a
necessary
accomplishment
to
ladies
possessing
these
rural
boudoirs
her
proposition
seemed
agreeable
to
every
one
particularly
as
the
walk
to
the
cottage
led
through
much
of
what
was
most
interesting
in
the
grounds
immediately
after
breakfast
therefore
the
whole
party
assembled
in
front
of
the
castle
to
commence
their
ramble
lord
arandale
saying
that
he
would
show
julia
the
way
drew
her
arm
over
his
lord
morven
offered
his
to
frances
henry
joined
colonel
morven
lady
susan
walked
alone
and
edmund
who
on
first
setting
out
had
intended
to
walk
at
the
other
side
of
julia
felt
himself
obliged
in
common
politeness
to
step
forward
and
join
the
lady
who
had
no
companion
he
did
not
however
intend
to
offer
his
arm
as
he
meant
to
avail
himself
of
the
first
favourable
opportunity
for
desertion
but
her
ladyship
struck
her
foot
against
the
stump
of
a
flower
root
then
limped
a
step
or
two
and
next
came
in
contact
with
a
loose
stone
in
short
he
found
it
impossible
to
evince
a
suitable
concern
for
such
accidents
without
saying
something
about
an
arm
lady
susan
accordingly
took
his
arm
laughed
at
her
own
giddiness
confessed
her
want
of
a
guide
she
added
i
ought
rather
to
be
yours
instead
of
making
myself
so
edmund
said
very
coolly
as
he
thought
that
he
was
happy
in
being
useful
reproached
her
ladyship
in
due
form
for
misnaming
the
pleasure
of
being
so
a
trouble
and
proceeded
to
hope
that
she
had
not
suffered
materially
from
his
negligence
in
the
first
instance
there
was
something
so
soothing
so
persuasive
in
manner
and
voice
at
all
times
that
common
politeness
from
him
possessed
an
almost
dangerous
charm
and
her
ladyship
was
willing
to
be
deceived
such
a
manner
must
be
the
result
of
suppressed
feeling
thought
lady
susan
but
she
remembered
the
coffee
yet
might
not
even
that
she
asked
herself
be
one
of
the
strange
inconsistencies
of
love
her
spirits
began
to
rise
and
her
good
humour
never
long
absent
returned
she
introduced
sentimental
subjects
and
frequently
spoke
in
so
low
a
tone
that
edmund
was
obliged
to
stoop
towards
her
to
gather
the
meaning
of
what
she
said
so
that
to
those
who
walked
behind
them
they
appeared
to
be
engaged
in
very
earnest
and
very
interesting
conversation
they
turned
off
into
a
narrower
walk
and
the
next
time
edmund
looked
over
his
shoulder
which
he
did
rather
oftener
than
lady
susan
liked
not
one
of
the
rest
of
the
party
was
any
where
to
be
seen
ladyship
should
certainly
know
the
way
here
said
edmund
hesitating
and
slackening
his
pace
we
have
either
left
them
all
very
far
behind
or
taken
a
wrong
is
the
prettiest
way
to
my
cottage
said
her
ladyship
which
they
will
all
certainly
bend
their
steps
by
whatever
walk
they
may
have
gone
accordingly
our
advance
couple
proceeded
onward
uninterrupted
through
delightful
solitudes
her
ladyship
grew
more
and
more
romantic
many
of
her
opinions
many
of
her
very
expressions
were
in
perfect
unison
with
the
secret
sentiments
of
edmund
though
those
sentiments
had
it
must
be
confessed
another
object
replies
therefore
were
frequently
bursts
of
feeling
suddenly
checked
he
was
often
silent
and
sometimes
sighed
lady
susan
no
longer
doubted
there
was
a
struggle
in
her
bosom
between
natural
modesty
and
a
generous
wish
to
reward
the
attachment
of
one
who
was
kept
silent
by
honourable
and
manly
motives
by
this
time
they
reached
the
cottage
it
was
all
that
was
rural
thatched
of
course
and
overgrown
with
jessamine
honeysuckle
and
ever
blowing
roses
buried
in
the
deep
woods
that
surrounded
the
castle
it
had
a
little
paled
in
garden
and
a
small
space
of
green
clear
in
its
front
and
at
the
foot
of
the
green
ran
a
little
rivulet
with
a
plank
thrown
over
it
to
form
a
rustic
bridge
tamed
pheasants
strayed
about
instead
of
fowl
a
kid
was
tied
to
the
paling
and
a
sheep
with
two
lambs
fed
on
the
little
plot
of
grass
before
the
door
her
ladyship
having
with
assistance
crossed
the
plank
caressed
each
of
her
favourites
as
she
passed
them
and
leading
the
way
through
the
little
garden
opened
the
latch
of
the
cottage
all
within
was
perfect
rusticity
the
furniture
consisted
of
a
small
dresser
with
a
few
delf
plates
a
corner
cupboard
with
some
common
looking
cups
and
saucers
a
deal
table
a
few
wooden
chairs
a
low
three
legged
stool
a
spinning
wheel
a
kettle
and
some
dried
herbs
suspended
from
the
ceiling
some
bright
tin
utensils
arranged
on
nails
against
the
wall
over
the
and
a
small
hung
at
the
side
of
the
latticed
window
lady
susan
became
silent
and
absent
went
to
various
repositories
of
grain
and
fed
each
of
her
pets
edmund
of
course
assisting
when
she
had
finished
she
seated
herself
on
the
stool
and
began
to
spin
with
great
assiduity
and
quite
a
practised
hand
edmund
whom
she
had
requested
to
take
a
chair
beside
her
sat
for
some
time
in
silent
admiration
of
her
performance
suddenly
she
lifted
the
toe
of
the
foot
that
had
kept
the
wheel
in
motion
and
suspended
the
little
white
hand
over
the
fore
finger
of
which
the
thread
had
been
passing
spot
you
see
captain
montgomery
she
said
my
plaything
yet
how
happy
might
people
be
whose
all
it
was
he
replied
with
much
energy
instantly
making
julia
in
imagination
its
mistress
and
himself
her
partner
for
life
is
all
that
unsophisticated
nature
calls
for
and
in
the
society
of
an
object
beloved
how
seldom
would
the
outer
world
be
remembered
her
ladyship
blushed
and
sighed
but
thoughts
were
full
of
another
image
and
the
blush
and
the
sigh
which
else
might
have
spoken
volumes
were
unnoticed
by
him
a
considerable
pause
ensued
certainly
is
madness
said
lady
susan
at
length
in
a
low
voice
and
with
some
hesitation
to
sacrifice
realities
to
opinions
and
those
opinions
not
our
own
most
assuredly
replied
edmund
such
is
the
case
but
when
our
own
opinions
our
own
sense
of
all
that
is
honourable
just
grateful
are
in
direct
opposition
to
our
own
feelings
of
all
that
recollected
himself
broke
off
suddenly
and
coloured
not
that
he
apprehended
being
misunderstood
he
rather
dreaded
that
he
was
too
well
understood
and
conscious
that
he
thought
of
julia
while
he
spoke
feared
he
had
inadvertently
betrayed
sentiments
it
was
so
incumbent
upon
him
to
conceal
said
her
ladyship
the
an
attachment
so
tender
yet
governed
so
entirely
by
honourable
principles
is
willing
to
wave
imaginary
in
favour
of
real
superiority
she
held
out
her
hand
edmund
first
stared
at
the
hand
then
scarcely
conscious
of
the
mechanical
movement
took
it
in
his
sake
what
do
you
mean
lady
susan
he
exclaimed
changing
colour
twenty
times
in
a
minute
for
still
possessed
with
the
one
idea
and
too
little
of
a
coxcomb
to
be
ready
to
believe
her
ladyship
seriously
attached
to
him
because
idle
people
had
jested
on
the
subject
the
thought
crossed
his
mind
in
the
confusion
of
the
moment
that
lady
susan
must
be
in
the
confidence
of
her
cousin
and
must
be
expressing
her
belief
that
julia
returned
his
attachment
lady
susan
spoke

would
be

affectation

of
your

and
i

the
motives
that
have
prevented
their
open
her
ladyship
looked
down
paused
and
trembled
excessively
voices
were
heard
without
the
party
passed
the
paling
gate
and
moved
along
the
little
walk
of
the
garden
lady
susan
looked
in
alarm
towards
the
door
coloured
very
deeply
and
said
in
a
hurried
tone
and
with
a
kind
of
smile
that
struggled
with
a
few
tears
of
mingled
pleasure
and
shame
is
rather
hard
that
i
should
have
it
to
say
half
unasked
after
all
yet
in
favour
of
your
motives
which
i
honour
i
will
say
am
yours
at
this
moment
the
whole
party
flocked
in
and
filled
up
the
little
cottage
room
lady
susan
snatched
away
her
hand
which
edmund
had
been
too
much
puzzled
to
resign
and
resumed
her
spinning
in
a
state
of
overwhelming
confusion
edmund
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
looking
and
feeling
if
possible
still
more
confounded
his
colour
mounting
gradually
as
his
perception
of
the
truth
cleared
up
while
his
countenance
became
filled
with
expressions
the
most
inexplicable
lord
arandale
fortunately
for
lady
susan
was
too
busy
speaking
to
julia
about
some
of
the
beauties
of
the
grounds
to
observe
his
daughter
but
he
addressed
an
ear
that
heard
little
of
what
he
said
julia
during
the
walk
had
been
wishing
that
edmund
would
join
them
she
had
observed
him
when
going
on
before
the
rest
of
the
party
with
lady
susan
and
seemingly
engaged
in
a
conversation
so
earnest
and
she
had
even
then
felt
a
slight
unacknowledged
sensation
of
uneasiness
on
entering
the
cottage
the
first
object
that
met
her
eye
was
the
eye
of
edmund
for
the
first
time
its
expression
did
not
banish
every
shadow
from
her
thoughts
did
not
bring
sunshine
to
her
heart
it
had
never
before
had
a
meaning
that
she
had
not
felt
at
least
if
not
exactly
understood
and
felt
with
a
too
dangerous
consciousness
of
delight
now
his
eye
wandered
from
hers
without
an
answering
look
lady
susan
too
how
extraordinary
was
her
expression
julia
became
in
one
moment
though
she
had
no
time
to
ask
herself
why
miserable
entirely
miserable
it
was
a
kind
of
wretchedness
too
that
she
had
never
before
even
imagined
it
alarmed
her
a
hopelessness
came
over
her
heart
that
in
all
her
grievings
over
the
thoughts
of
going
away
she
had
never
known
though
she
had
never
formed
any
other
plan
but
that
edmund
was
to
be
her
friend
her
brother
she
his
friend
his
sister
this
had
all
been
while
the
bare
idea
of
ever
being
other
than
the
first
in
his
affections
had
not
once
presented
itself
to
her
imagination
as
even
possible
but
now
unaccustomed
as
she
was
to
analyze
subjects
of
love
and
marriage
there
was
something
in
the
circumstances
of
the
two
conscious
beings
before
her
which
seemed
obviously
to
set
up
a
living
breathing
object
between
herself
and
edmund
why
such
should
be
any
obstacle
to
brotherly
and
sisterly
regard
still
subsisting
between
them
she
did
not
particularly
enquire
yet
all
the
stores
of
love
and
happiness
that
she
had
been
collecting
from
infancy
seemed
now
to
have
been
swept
away
in
one
single
moment
she
continued
however
to
hang
on
the
arm
of
lord
arandale
and
to
answer
any
direct
questions
put
to
her
as
well
as
she
could
after
examining
and
admiring
the
cottage
and
grounds
the
party
at
length
returned
to
the
before
the
castle
a
curricle
with
a
gentleman
driving
and
a
lady
seated
beside
him
was
now
seen
approaching
is
lady
morven
at
last
said
lord
arandale
letting
go
arm
and
advancing
towards
the
new
arrival
i
declare
cried
lady
susan
hastening
forward
with
her
brother
who
on
their
return
from
the
cottage
had
in
a
very
marked
manner
insisted
on
her
taking
his
second
arm
edmund
who
had
walked
in
silence
on
the
other
side
of
julia
pondering
partly
on
her
altered
manner
and
partly
on
his
own
late
adventure
when
lord
arandale
withdrew
his
support
took
up
her
hand
softly
and
drew
it
over
his
arm
bending
forward
at
the
same
time
as
if
anxious
to
catch
a
view
of
her
countenance
she
kept
her
head
however
carefully
turned
in
a
contrary
direction
and
the
moment
they
reached
the
steps
without
speaking
or
looking
round
withdrew
her
arm
glided
away
and
hurried
up
to
her
own
room
yet
such
is
the
weakness
of
the
heart
that
loves
that
she
had
felt
less
unhappy
during
the
few
seconds
her
arm
had
rested
on
that
of
edmund
conduct
and
feelings
on
this
occasion
were
certainly
very
foolish
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
she
was
scarcely
eighteen
that
she
had
been
brought
up
in
perfect
seclusion
a
seclusion
too
of
sentiment
where
from
five
years
old
she
had
never
seen
or
even
heard
any
thing
of
life
but
within
the
one
domestic
circle
in
which
all
that
was
thought
of
was
tender
mourning
for
the
one
that
was
lost
and
tender
cherishing
of
the
few
that
were
left
it
is
not
then
surprising
that
those
few
and
the
first
place
in
their
hearts
should
be
romantically
valued
by
one
whose
opening
mind
had
thus
in
every
stage
of
its
developement
been
strongly
impressed
with
the
one
idea
that
all
the
rest
of
the
world
must
be
for
ever
strangers
to
her
in
comparison
of
those
who
had
in
this
exclusive
manner
possessed
her
earliest
affections
and
when
in
addition
to
all
this
the
spell
of
a
had
fallen
on
a
heart
so
prepared
could
much
philosophy
be
expected
chapter
vi
this
a
madness
that
is
upon
me
the
party
we
left
at
the
door
reinforced
by
a
number
of
newly
arrived
nephews
and
nieces
of
my
and
my
were
by
this
time
entering
the
great
at
the
further
end
of
which
lady
arandale
was
seated
on
a
sofa
arranging
on
a
table
before
her
the
presents
she
had
brought
for
her
nieces
from
out
of
the
entering
group
one
lady
whose
precedence
seemed
to
be
undisputed
came
forward
towards
lady
arandale
it
was
lady
morven
she
was
very
tall
and
very
slight
with
long
thin
limbs
a
small
head
a
little
round
face
deeply
pockmarked
small
grey
eyes
scarcely
any
nose
and
a
small
mouth
without
any
lips
she
was
highly
rouged
and
dressed
both
fashionably
and
extravagantly
and
her
figure
though
totally
without
form
had
an
air
of
grace
as
well
as
of
elegance
the
first
salutation
over
she
flung
herself
on
a
sofa
opposite
to
that
occupied
by
lady
arandale

and
the
wretch
thought
fit
to
fall
out
of
his
curricle
the
very
day
he
was
coming
over
to
take
me
so
there
i
have
had
him
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
lounging
about
at
morven

ever
since
quite
a
bore
i
assure
you
ladyship
does
me

out

depths
of

well
furnished
with
down

established
himself

replied
her
ladyship
and
as
she
spoke
she
made
room
for
him
adding
you
not
better
come
over

meditating
the
exertion
of
a
removal

he
rejoined

asked
lady
arandale
this
nursing

wounds
a
business
replied
lady
morven
a
parcel
of
the
girls
you
know
the
girls
were
all
above
twenty
that
creature
sir
archibald
oswald
harmless
as
usual
though
more
mad
i
think
than
ever
is
that
graham
or
lady
morven
who
does
sir
archibald
oswald
the
honour
of
naming
him
demanded
a
voice
in
the
tones
of
which
a
slight
tincture
of
affectation
was
blended
with
melancholy
and
melody
it
arose
from
a
yet
unseen
personage
of
whose
arrival
no
one
seemed
to
be
aware
and
who
reclining
on
a
in
the
recess
of
a
distant
window
was
sheltered
from
observation
by
a
large
circular
stand
of
exotics
lady
morven
started
on
her
seat
with
a
sort
of
rebound
the
young
people
smiled
and
tittered
a
little
lord
arandale
looked
at
them
and
frowned
you
there
my
good
friend
he
said
going
towards
the
reclining
gentleman
who
at
his
approach
slowly
and
reluctantly
arose
may
weel
ask
whilk
it
was
that
spack
sir
archy
observed
lady
arandale
who
prided
herself
on
speaking
broad
scotch
is
vara
true
there
is
nae
telling
the
voice
the
one
fra
that
the
drawled
lady
morven
quite
admire
accent
and
therefore
i
make
it
a
point
to
speak
like
ladyship
is
too
good
articulated
the
drowsy
subject
of
this
compliment
sir
archibald
by
this
time
stood
quite
erect
answering
some
polite
enquiries
of
lord
arandale
and
lord
morven
who
seemed
desirous
to
unite
in
shewing
a
peculiar
degree
of
courtesy
to
this
guest
edmund
stood
alone
observing
with
much
interest
the
appearance
of
sir
archibald
the
peculiar
and
melancholy
melody
of
whose
voice
had
first
drawn
his
attention
his
figure
was
tall
well
proportioned
and
had
an
air
of
dignity
he
seemed
little
more
than
fifty
but
very
grey
for
that
age
his
hair
was
parted
on
the
forehead
and
fell
on
either
side
of
the
face
so
long
and
with
so
little
regard
to
present
modes
as
to
resemble
that
of
one
of
the
ancient
bards
his
countenance
though
its
beauty
was
almost
defaced
by
the
deepest
furrows
of
affliction
and
premature
old
age
still
retained
the
outlines
of
fine
features
to
which
the
melancholy
that
predominated
in
its
expression
gave
much
interest
lord
arandale
summoned
edmund
by
a
look
and
presented
him
to
sir
archibald
saying
gentleman
sir
archibald
can
talk
to
you
on
your
favourite
subject
of
naval
affairs
better
than
most
edmund
now
joined
the
group
and
while
taking
a
part
in
the
very
incoherent
conversation
that
was
going
on
observed
with
much
compassion
that
the
fire
which
awakened
animation
from
time
to
time
called
into
the
eye
of
the
evidently
unfortunate
being
before
him
varied
from
wild
to
gloomy
and
from
gloomy
to
wild
but
never
once
expressed
pleasure
indeed
it
was
when
he
attempted
to
smile
that
the
light
was
wildest
and
how
instantaneously
how
darkly
did
the
cloud
that
thus
had
opened
but
for
a
moment
close
again
a
wreck
is
there
said
lord
arandale
to
our
hero
as
sir
archibald
and
lord
morven
left
the
room
together
edmund
looked
a
sort
of
enquiry
which
the
earl
answered
thus
gambling
it
was
which
ruined
him
as
it
has
done
many
is
a
man
who
years
since
possessed
a
property
of
twelve
thousand
per
annum
in
this
county
where
he
was
well
known
and
much
respected
by
us
all
he
has
not
sixpence
in
the
world
he
lives
in
the
isle
of
man
his
poor
wife
is
they
say
and
his
boy
is
bringing
up
without
education
or
prospects
it
was
the
birth
of
that
child
to
an
inheritance
of
ruin
which
i
believe
unsettled
poor
mind
when
he
is
sane
he
remains
on
the
island
in
the
strictest
retirement
but
when
he
wanders
in
mind
he
wanders
in
body
also
and
throwing
himself
into
any
fishing
smack
or
boat
that
happens
to
be
on
the
coast
wherever
he
may
chance
to
be
landed
on
the
main
land
he
makes
his
way
to
this
neighbourhood
visits
the
houses
of
those
with
whom
he
used
to
associate
in
his
days
of
prosperity
seems
unconscious
that
any
change
has
taken
place
and
wears
wherever
he
goes
such
clothes
as
are
left
for
him
in
his
room
sometimes
he
enters
the
house
where
he
once
was
master
fancies
it
still
his
home
and
acts
the
host
with
all
the
graceful
politeness
for
which
he
was
once
remarkable
treating
the
family
now
residing
there
and
any
company
they
happen
to
have
with
them
as
his
looks
to
great
advantage
when
he
is

him

on
which
lady
morven
lolled
laird
you
know
is
very
short
and
very
fat
and
you
never
saw
such
a
figure
as
sir
archibald
makes
in
his
clothes
even
when
they
are
as
in
this
instance
the
results
of
the
own
imprudence
still
are
bad
subjects
for
merriment
mournfully
observed
lord
arandale
to
whom
the
attempt
to
cast
ridicule
on
his
unhappy
friend
seemed
very
unwelcome

he
continued
turning
to

leading
him
apart

he
lowered
his
voice
and
looked
towards
henry
to
see
that
he
was
not
within
hearing
was
that
horrible
aubin
that
young
father
who
ruined
poor
oswald
i
believe
too
he
added
oswald
was
very
sincerely
attached
to
poor
maria
before
she
made
the
unfortunate
choice
she
did
and
that
disappointment
had
its
share
in
throwing
him
into
bad
is
the
cause
asked
edmund
the
interest
sir
archibald
seems
to
take
in
the
navy
did
belong
to
the
profession
in
very
early
life
replied
his
lordship
was
fond
of
it
i
believe
but
left
it
when
his
father
and
elder
brother
died
in
his
lucid
intervals
i
understand
he
wishes
very
ardently
to
get
his
boy
afloat
but
no
one
you
see
likes
to
take
charge
of
a
lad
so
unfortunately
situated
it
would
be
attended
too
with
some
share
of
expense
for
poor
oswald
has
not
even
the
means
of
fitting
him
out
and
lady
relatives
who
are
very
powerful
have
never
pardoned
her
the
misfortunes
she
has
brought
on
herself
for
oswald
was
nearly
a
ruined
man
when
the
marriage
took
place
she
however
had
been
previously
engaged
and
attached
and
would
not
break
it
edmund
was
so
forcibly
struck
by
this
melancholy
relation
that
he
made
no
immediate
reply
he
thought
of
what
he
himself
had
been
when
a
boy
of
what
he
might
have
been
at
this
day
had
no
benevolent
hand
been
stretched
forth
in
his
behalf
his
resolution
was
taken
but
he
made
no
allusion
to
it
at
the
time
and
retired
to
dress
pondering
the
subject
for
the
half
hour
bell
was
ringing
and
all
the

dispersing
on
the
same
important
errand
frances
and

had
all
this

been
busily
engaged

not

correctly

for
the

seemed
quitting
their
ranks
and
mingling
in

disorderly
maze
this
however
was
of
little
importance

she
had
held
the

upside
down
from
the
first

of

and
continuing
the

her

noticing
the

off

evident
confusion

so
immoderately
that
it

of
my

lady
morven

were
lounging
on
an

talking
about

apparently
fearful

exhausting
their

than
three
of

the

seated
on
a
sofa
with
a
gordon
edmund
and

susan
stood
in
a
very
distant
window
in
deep
conversation

in
another
and
nearer

stood
lord

morven
a
brother
of

lord
morven
colonel
morven
and
two
morven
in
conversation

and

entered
and
some
family
introductions
were
made
during
which
sir
archibald
left
the
circle
of
gentlemen
which
had
surrounded
him
approached
the
sisters
and
stood
gazing
at
them
sir
archibald
was
always
a
great
admirer
of
beauty
observed
lord
arandale
aside
to
the
general
still
i
think
it
seems
to
possess
a
sort
of
soothing
power
over
his
exasperated
said
the
general
though
i
think
either
of
the
girls
like
their
aunt
he
may
perceive
that
degree
of
family
resemblance
in
julia
which
has
sometimes
so
powerful

effect

the
disordered

so
young
replied
his
lordship
i
should
think
he
could
scarcely
remember
was
a

certainly
said
the
general
it
was
i
believe
a
which
they
say
leaves
an
indelible
is
fortunate
that
he
does
not
seem
to
perceive
terrific
likeness
to
his
father
observed
the
earl
by
this
time
julia
was
seated
and
sir
archibald
had
taken
a
footstool
placed
it
at
her
feet
and
seated
himself
upon
it
he
looked
up
mournfully
in
her
face
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
commenced
giving
utterance
to
a
low
murmuring
sound
which
gradually
swelled
into
the
rich
harmonies
of
a
very
old
song
all
the
changes
of
which
were
performed
with
the
most
perfect
melody
of
voice
and
to
which
a
pervading
melancholy
diversified
by
occasional
starts
of
wildness
gave
indescribable
interest
all
became
silent
listeners
not
a
whisper
broke
the
spell
till
the
growl
of
the
gong
was
heard
then
its
roar
like
that
of
beasts
of
prey
sir
archibald
ceased
listened
arose
and
without
appearing
aware
of
his
own
late
performance
offered
his
arm
to
julia
and
all
this
with
quite
the
air
of
a
man
of
the
world
his
manners
at
the
moment
were
even
tinctured
with
that
slight
degree
of
affectation
which
once
was
one
of
his
youthful
foibles
while
they
bore
no
mark
whatever
of
the
deranged
state
of
his
mind

next
led
lady
susan
from
the
recess
of
the
window
this
last
couple
were
first
waited
for
at
the
door
and
then
followed
to
the
by
lord
morven
who
seemed
to
view
his
flirtation
with
much
more
severity
of
aspect
than
he
manifested
towards
his
lady
susan
did
not
smile
once
in
the
whole
course
of
dinner
a
thing
never
known
before
edmund
was
silently
and
respectfully
attentive
to
her
ladyship
but
also
grave
julia
received
with
absent
passiveness
the
politeness
of
sir
archibald
wondering
the
while
why
lady
susan
did
not
look
happy
the
rest
of
the
party
were
very
gay
during
the
dessert
sir
archibald
asked
lord
arandale
in
a
careless
manner
how
the
pretty
miller
did
the
earl
was
at
a
stand
for
a
few
moments
but
throwing
his
recollections
back
some
five
and
twenty
years
he
answered
i
beautiful
creature
she
was
he
repeated
sir
archibald
accident
i
hope
has
befallen
the
lady
any
to
my
knowledge
replied
the
earl
then
addressing
morven
aside
he
added
that
the
suns
of
twenty
or
thirty
summers
have
withered
the
fresh
bloom
and
the
snows
of
as
many
winters
whitened
the
bright
locks
of
pretty
miller
but
poor
oswald
i
see
is
thinking
of
our
adventure
with
that
fair
dame
as
of
a
business
of
yesterday
how
mysterious
is
the
power
of
association
and
the
earl
smiled
though
with
a
mixture
of
melancholy
at
his
own
recollections
morven
requested
a
translation
of
the
smile
i
tell
that
good
story
oswald
said
lord
arandale
sir
archibald
had
become
absent
again
and
replied
only
by
a
bow
much
curiosity
however
being
expressed
by
the
ladies
to
hear
what
had
been
announced
as
a
good
story
the
earl
was
prevailed
on
to
commence
the
following
relation
and
myself
were
a
pair
of
wild
fellows
in
those
days
he
proceeded
happened
to
be
riding
together
one
fine
morning
how
long
since
i
shall
not
say
when
passing
through
the
village
of
irvine
we
saw
seated
in
a
window
at
work
but
dressed
gayly
enough
a
very
beautiful
young
woman
no
other
than
this
said
miller
we
knew
not
of
course
who
the
lady
might
be
so
went
to
a
shop
nearly
opposite
to
ask
the
question
here
we
learned
that
the
fair
object
of
our
enquiries
was
the
young
wife
of
the
old
minister
we
drew
off
and
put
our
heads
together
to
consult
on
the
measures
to
be
adopted
next
miller
said
i
will
esteem
it
not
only
a
compliment
but
an
eternal
obligation
if
i
call
on
him
and
i
can
take
any
friend
with
me
you
know
that
i
please
we
rode
to
the
door
sent
in
our
names
and
were
admitted
into
a
small
smoky
dirty
parlour
the
inside
of
which
i
shall
never
forget
the
perfumes
of
a
lately
removed
dinner
of
which
a
certain
fragrant
vegetable
and
a
no
less
odoriferous
liquid
had
evidently
formed
component
parts
were
overpowering
especially
to
people
who
had
been
just
galloping
their
horses
over
the
fresh
heath
of
the
open
moorlands
the
old
minister
in
his
worsted
hose
and
red
nightcap
but
i
shall
not
attempt
to
paint
him
met
us

booing
and
returning
thanks
to
my

for
the
honour

on
him
and
his

declaring
with
another
boo
to
oswald
that

the

well

while
was
making
some
pretty
side
speeches
to
miller
so
that
the
old
fellow
beginning
to
perceive
that
our
visit
was
to
his
wife
not
to
himself
after
fidgeting
and
looking
foolish
for
a
few
minutes
seemed
struck
with
a
sudden
thought
in
pursuance
of
which
he
played
us
such
a
trick
as
never
was
i
believe
practised
before
on
two
gay
fellows
like
ourselves
lord
he
said
with
mock
solemnity
is
just
oor

marking
yier
personal
respeck
for
yier
minister
hath
so
saying
and
without
giving
us
time
to
take
any
measures
of
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
began
to
pray
aloud
the
lady
knelt
down
also
and
faith
we
were
taken
so
by
surprise
that
if
we
did
not
absolutely
kneel
we
stood
with
our
faces
in
our
hats
resolving
not
to
call
again
at
that
hour
the
prayer
was
unmercifully
long
extemporary
of
course
and
consisting
chiefly
of
earnest
supplication
for
grace
to
withstand
all
temptation
to
such
errors
as
he
thought
fit
in
his
christian
charity
to
suspect
were
just
then
the
besetting
sins
of
his
congregation
what
a
cordial
we
found
the
air
even
of
the
street
when
at
last
we
got
into
it
which
we
did
the
moment
the
amen
had
been
pronounced
in
a
day
or
two
however
we
called
at
quite
a
different
hour
but
had
not
been
seated
many
seconds
when
the
old
fellow
told
us
with
a
sly
ironical
smile
that
we
surely
had
the
gift
prophecy
for
that
we
were
just
in
time
again
for
his
family
prayer
accordingly
he
was
about
to
kneel
as
before
but
this
being
rather
too
much
of
a
good
thing
we
made
our
escape
and
gave
up
the
acquaintance
both
of
maistriss
and
maister
miller
take
notice
however
young
men
continued
the
earl
addressing
himself
particularly
to
his
family
circle
do
not
mean
to
offer
this
conduct
of
my
own
and
my
friends
as
an
example
for
your
imitation
it
was
highly
improper
though
in
our
own
justification
i
must
add
that
we
had
no
worse
intention
than
to
frighten
the
old
fellow
a
little
and
excite
the
vanity
of
his
wife
as
what
we
in
our
wisdoms
considered
a
just
penance
for
his
having
helped
himself
to
one
so
much
too
young
and
too
pretty
for
during
the
comments
which
followed
sir
archibald
caught
the
sound
of
voice
which
had
the
exact
tone
of
his
particularly
in
a
laugh
he
glanced
his
eye
in
that
direction
and
now
seemed
to
see
young
aubin
for
the
first
time
though
he
was
seated
exactly
opposite
to
him
clouds
gathered
on
brow
and
he
directed
across
the
table
looks
so
fierce
and
so
portentous
that
the
whole
company
became
alarmed
the
ladies
rose
to
retire
and
lord
arandale
during
the
move
which
their
exit
occasioned
gave
henry
a
hint
to
keep
as
much
as
possible
out
of

once
did
resolution
as
it
was
still
some
of
the
ladies
walked
to
the
gardens
others
strolled
about
near
the
doors
lady
susan
disappeared
without
speaking
to
any
one
frances
went
to
seek
her
julia
flung
herself
on
a
sofa
in
the
great
which
she
found
quite
deserted
she
lay
so
much
absorbed
by
her
own
meditations
as
to
be
unconscious
of
the
lapse
of
time
it
became
quite
dark
every
thing
was
still
about
her
at
length
she
heard
a
very
soft
step
approaching
through
the
and
a
figure
in
black
appeared
within
the
door
which
was
half
open
it
held
in
its
hand
a
long
white
wand
tipped
with
flame
it
glided
on
with
a
step
now
that
it
was
on
the
deep
turkey
carpet
of
the
quite
noiseless
it
touched
branches
and
candelabras
with
its
magic
wand
and
left
floods
of
light
behind
it
it
proceeded
through
the
glass
doors
of
a
at
the
further
end
of
this
spacious
apartment
and
continued
crowning
with
radiance
lustres
that
hung
at
certain
intervals
over
the
centre
walk
till
the
whole
long
perspective
became
a
dazzling
maze
of
real
and
reflected
illumination
eyes
admired
and
mechanically
followed
what
they
beheld
long
before
her
comprehension
was
aroused
to
any
understanding
of
what
was
going
forward
at
length
she
smiled
as
she
recollected
that
such
had
been
her
abstraction
that
for
the
first
few
moments
after
the
entrance
of
the
figure
she
had
viewed
it
and
its
operations
with
as
much
of
almost
superstitious
astonishment
as
if
she
had
never
before
seen
a
decent
old
butler
who
was
too
to
wear
creaking
shoes
light
up
a
she
arose
from
the
sofa
passed
the
man
on
his
return
through
the
great
room
entered
the
greenhouse
proceeded
along
the
centre
walk
between
rows
of
orange
trees
and
in
a
blaze
of
light
till
the
white
marble
footway
branching
off
in
two
directions
led
round
on
both
sides
towards
a
kind
of
arbour
of
sweets
which
was
screened
from
the
entrance
and
principal
walk
by
the
intervention
of
an
immense
circular
stand
crowded
from
the
marble
floor
to
the
glazed
roof
with
numberless
exotics
here
she
seated
herself
the
artificial
day
that
reigned
around
the
excess
of
brilliancy
resembling
enchantment
the
very
intensity
of
light
seemed
if
not
literally
shelter
at
least
security
from
sudden
intrusion
by
giving
proof
at
once
that
none
were
near
and
certainty
that
none
could
approach
unseen
wonder
mentally
ejaculated
julia
who
by
this
time
had
renewed
her
meditations
she
did
not
look
happy
she
paused
and
a
tear
or
two
fell
it
possible
that
he
can
love
a
stranger
better
than
those
he
has
loved
all
his
life
she
thought
and
a
feeling
of
something
like
reproach
passed
through
her
mind
then
came
a
series
of
kindly
recollections
making
it
very
difficult
to
believe
that
this
could
be
the
case
then
she
called
to
mind
how
edmund
always
used
to
say
he
never
would
marry
and
how
she
too
had
determined
never
to
marry
she
reflected
on
this
subject
for
some
time
then
asked
herself
a
question
but
very
vaguely
indeed
for
she
did
not
venture
to
give
it
the
form
of
words
even
in
thought
the
purport
however
was
as
follows
edmund
had
ever
said
that
to
be
married
to
her
was
absolutely
necessary
to
his
would
have
been
her
reply
a
deep
blush
was
all
the
answer
she
gave
herself
she
sat
unconscious
of
outward
objects
till
she
felt
her
hand
softly
taken
she
started
and
looked
up
edmund
stood
before
her
julia
he
said
has
so
evidently
been
some
anxiety
on
your
mind
some
depression
on
your
spirits
all
this
day
that
i
can
not
resist
taking
perhaps
an
unwarrantable
liberty
and
entreating
you
to
tell
me
what
it
is
that
thus
distresses
you
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
and
made
no
reply
you
not
promise
he
continued
permit
me
to
call
myself
your
friend
your
brother
and
is
not
confidence
the
privilege
of
friendship
and
he
seated
himself
beside
her
still
retaining
the
hand
he
had
taken
wish
edmund
she
said
her
face
averted
hear
you
talk
like
a
stranger
about
taking
the
liberty
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
it
only
makes
me
more
unhappy
he
repeated
you
know
she
continued
you
wished
so
very
much
for
my
friendship
edmund
it
was
when
you
first
came
home
will
so
many
new
friends
cried
quite
thrown
off
his
guard
he
added
passionately
are
all
the
new
all
the
friends
the
world
the
whole
world
itself
to
me
in
comparison
of
you
julia
my
earliest
my
kindest
friend
he
added
hastily
fearful
he
had
gone
too
far
the
assurance
of
a
so
exclusive
so
much
in
unison
with
her
own
ideas
on
the
subject
and
still
more
the
tender
and
agitated
tone
in
which
words
so
kind
were
uttered
banished
every
thought
of
lady
susan
and
in
one
moment
restored
julia
to
perfect
happiness
for
reply
she
only
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
their
expression
seemed
to
him
at
the
moment
to
justify
him
in
pressing
her
hand
to
his
lips
though
afterwards
he
thought
he
had
done
very
wrong
so
much
accustomed
was
julia
however
to
consider
the
establishment
of
perfect
confidence
between
herself
and
edmund
as
quite
necessary
and
right
that
in
all
this
she
saw
but
the
kind
reconciliation
of
and
never
dreamed
of
being
surprised
as
some
more
experienced
ladies
might
have
been
that
no
fuller
or
tenderer
declaration
followed
neither
apology
for
having
approached
so
near
to
such
she
now
felt
quite
certain
that
edmund
still
loved
her
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
and
therefore
she
was
happy
he
thought
his
secret
still
safe
because
he
saw
he
had
not
given
offence
indeed
he
saw
more
suspicions
delightful
suspicions
fluttered
at
his
heart
he
watched
the
brightening
of
her
features
yes
he
could
not
refuse
to
admit
the
flattering
the
intoxicating
conviction
that
the
more
his
love
betrayed
itself
the
happier
julia
evidently
was
thoughts
like
these
ought
to
have
filled
him
with
sorrow
and
repentance
but
they
did
caused
a
joy
that
no
words
can
paint
and
this
was
not
a
moment
to
resist
its
influence
he
was
gazing
upon
the
countenance
of
julia
she
had
just
looked
up
to
express
kindness
and
confidence
tears
of
pleasure
had
started
into
her
eyes
and
now
she
was
looking
down
again
perhaps
to
hide
them
but
they
were
stealing
into
view
over
cheeks
that
glowed
with
an
animating
a
beautifying
confusion
which
could
not
be
termed
a
mere
blush
for
it
visibly
betrayed
conscious
happiness
as
well
as
bashfulness
words
that
while
possessed
of
reason
he
had
determined
never
to
utter
literally
trembled
on
his
lips
but
honour
gratitude
principle
flew
to
his
aid
and
rescued
him
from
the
eternal
remorse
which
in
a
mind
like
his
must
have
followed
an
avowal
of
sentiments
it
was
so
much
his
duty
to
conceal
he
was
enabled
to
be
to
withdraw
his
eyes
from
the
contemplation
of
the
lovely
being
before
him
to
close
his
heart
against
the
dangerous
bliss
that
contemplation
afforded
was
impossible
music
now
struck
up
in
the
great
room
and
at
the
same
instant
several
persons
entered
the
greenhouse
the
next
moment
they
were
approaching
along
the
centre
walk
and
calling
julia
our
heroine
answered
and
made
her
appearance
edmund
still
trembling
from
the
late
agitation
of
his
feelings
followed
in
silence
but
when
he
saw
the
gay
group
gathering
round
julia
he
was
struck
with
the
sudden
apprehension
of
her
dancing
with
some
one
of
them
and
at
this
time
he
could
not
view
such
an
event
without
a
degree
of
horror
very
disproportionate
to
the
importance
of
the
subject
he
hastened
therefore
to
her
side
offered
her
his
arm
and
whispered
something
probably
a
request
to
dance
with
him
as
they
immediately
accompanied
those
who
had
come
in
search
of
them
into
the
where
quadrilles
were
forming
thus
was
edmund
preserved
from
further
risk
of
an
imprudence
which
in
addition
to
the
endless
repentance
it
would
have
cost
him
might
have
taught
even
the
inexperienced
julia
the
necessity
of
treating
him
with
more
reserve
hitherto
her
affectionate
heart
in
its
enthusiasm
had
ever
been
ready
to
reproach
her
with
estrangement
and
unkindness
when
she
experienced
but
the
natural
timidity
inseparable
from
the
feelings
which
were
hourly
growing
upon
her
so
that
the
very
parts
of
her
conduct
which
most
strongly
proved
those
feelings
to
be
more
than
friendship
were
by
her
not
unfrequently
considered
as
deficiencies
in
the
frankness
and
confidence
due
to
a
friend
the
companion
of
childhood
one
too
so
delicately
situated
who
thought
himself
so
much
obliged
who
might
mistake
a
reserve
very
proper
towards
strangers
by
whom
julia
meant
all
the
world
except
her
grandmamma
frances
edmund
and
jackson
for
pride
for
haughtiness
for
a
reminding
him
of
his
that
thought
was
not
to
be
endured
at
the
present
moment
however
her
heart
having
been
just
lightened
of
an
inexpressible
load
of
sorrow
of
the
first
doubt
it
had
ever
known
of
affection
she
waited
not
to
define
its
movements
but
joined
the
dance
feeling
as
if
she
moved
on
air
though
in
an
unusual
flutter
of
spirits
whilst
he
as
he
led
her
to
her
place
among
those
who
stood
in
all
the
pride
of
rank
and
title
birth
and
fortune
felt
his
heart
sink
within
him
and
as
he
gazed
upon
her
thus
removed
as
it
were
to
an
incalculable
distance
from
the
nameless
dependant
on
the
bounty
of
her
own
very
family
he
wondered
at
the
mad
presumption
that
but
the
moment
before
had
possessed
him
yet
as
from
time
to
time
she
smiled
and
spoke
to
him
joy
stole
again
into
his
bosom
and
he
experienced
an
undefined
species
of
happiness
during
the
remainder
of
the
quadrille
as
soon
as
it
was
over
however
and
before
julia
had
taken
her
arm
to
leave
the
set
henry
came
up
to
her
and
asked
her
to
dance
the
next
with
him
she
could
not
well
refuse
and
the
moment
she
consented
he
drew
her
arm
over
his
and
led
her
away
to
a
vacant
end
of
the
room
where
as
they
walked
up
and
down
he
suddenly
broke
silence
saying
in
a
rude
sort
of
half
whisper
suppose
julia
that
lord
will
consent
to
your
marrying
this
picked
up
fellow
this
edmund
and
i
can
tell
you
the
manner
in
which
you
are
behaving
will
end
in
his
being
forbid
my
house
and
indeed
the
houses
of
all
your
friends
and
if
ever
colour
mounted
now
it
flew
to
cheek
and
brow
yet
indignant
as
she
felt
such
was
her
terror
lest
edmund
should
chance
to
hear
one
of
those
shocking
words
that
she
caught
hand
and
entreated
him
to
lower
his
voice
at
the
same
moment
she
looked
involuntarily
towards
edmund
and
saw
that
he
observed
her
while
henry
grasping
the
hand
that
she
herself
had
laid
on
his
carried
it
to
his
lips
she
dreaded
to
provoke
him
by
withdrawing
it
either
as
quickly
or
as
angrily
as
she
felt
inclined
to
do
and
he
held
it
fast
with
the
most
malicious
satisfaction
in
her
dilemma
which
he
perfectly
understood
while
as
if
to
mortify
her
the
more
he
kept
up
by
countenance
and
manner
a
sort
of
dumb
show
of
tender
solicitude
she
however
forced
back
her
presence
of
mind
and
in
an
under
tone
of
suppressed
vexation
trying
at
the
same
time
to
look
dignified
and
as
angry
as
her
youth
and
natural
gentleness
would
permit
said
not
for
a
moment
imagine
henry
that
i
dread
your
rude
impertinent
remarks
on
my
own
account
but
take
care
you
do
not
let
one
word
be
heard
which
can
wound
the
feelings
of
edmund
as
for
the
motive
of
my
anxiety
on
this
point
if
you
are
not
capable
of
understanding
it
remain
in
ignorance
of
it
or
judge
it
what
you
please
it
is
to
my
father
not
to
you
sir
that
i
shall
give
an
account
of
my
fine
he
replied
julia
if
my
anxiety
for
you
proceeds
from
my
own
attachment
and
i
suppose
i
may
presume
where
edmund
does
you
can
not
be
surprised
that
i
should
not
wish
to
see
you
throw
yourself
away
but
i
believe
he
added
with
a
sneer
provoked
at
the
evident
scorn
depicted
on
countenance
at
the
mention
of
his
own
attachment
are
tolerably
safe
as
the
gallant
captain
montgomery
happens
not
to
be
at
leisure
to
accept
your
proffered
affections
being
otherwise
it
is
wonderful
how
many
times
in
the
course
of
the
evening
julia
repeated
over
to
herself
the
two
words
world
is
come
to
a
pretty
pass
continued
henry
two
titled
ladies
are
pulling
caps
for
a
fellow
without
a
name
bosom
was
swelling
with
indignation
pride
and
anger
she
was
dying
to
give
them
utterance
but
she
felt
that
now
she
dare
not
trust
herself
to
speak
while
her
fingers
in
despite
of
her
utmost
efforts
being
still
held
as
in
a
vice
she
could
not
disengage
herself
without
a
publicity
she
wished
to
avoid
indeed
henry
seemed
careless
how
roughly
he
treated
the
delicate
little
hand
thus
imprisoned
in
his
for
now
as
at
all
times
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
he
was
more
intent
on
persuading
others
that
he
was
well
with
his
cousin
than
on
really
making
her
believe
that
he
loved
her
at
this
moment
sir
archibald
who
had
been
standing
with
his
arms
folded
at
a
little
distance
came
hastily
forward
and
seized
henry
by
the
collar
crying
villain
villain
have
i
found
you
at
last
henry
disengaged
himself
and
turned
on
his
assailant
with
a
look
of
pale
rage
so
horrible
that
had
time
and
place
agreed
no
less
than
a
mortal
struggle
seemed
likely
to
ensue
julia
uttered
a
scream
of
terror
all
was
in
a
moment
confusion
and
consternation
lord
arandale
however
interfered
and
finally
prevailed
on
his
nephew
to
leave
the
room
for
the
evening
explaining
to
him
in
hasty
whispers
as
he
almost
forcibly
led
him
aside
that
sir
archibald
from
the
bewildered
state
of
his
mind
was
evidently
unconscious
of
the
lapse
of
time
and
must
in
consequence
have
mistaken
him
for
his
unfortunate
father
against
whom
he
had
but
too
just
cause
of
complaint
and
to
whose
memory
a
discussion
of
the
subject
would
be
by
no
means
creditable
julia
stood
trembling
and
for
a
moment
alone
the
next
edmund
was
at
her
side
he
saw
that
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
he
offered
his
arm
to
lead
her
to
a
seat
she
took
it
with
a
heavy
sigh
but
avoided
his
look
of
enquiry
he
felt
much
less
happy
than
he
had
been
why
had
she
caught
hand
why
had
she
suffered
him
to
press
hers
to
his
retain
it
too
so
long
why
had
she
looked
so
deeply
interested
in
what
he
said
and
what
was
the
cause
of
her
present
emotion
every
one
had
of
course
been
much
alarmed
several
of
the
young
ladies
had
fled
into
the
greenhouse
whence
they
now
peeped
through
the
glass
door
lady
morven
was
near
fainting
and
graham
was
unable
to
assist
her
some
one
proposed
music
as
the
most
likely
thing
to
calm
sir
excited
nerves
he
was
so
fond
of
it
one
of
the
miss
morvens
was
prevailed
upon
to
return
to
the
and
play
an
air
on
the
had
no
effect
lady
arandale
requested
julia
to
sing
she
at
first
wished
much
to
decline
but
lady
arandale
pressed
her
request
and
julia
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
consent
sir
archibald
was
still
walking
up
and
down
with
hasty
and
uneven
strides
leaning
on
the
arm
of
lord
arandale
song
commenced
sir
violent
gesticulations
gradually
became
less
frequent
his
step
as
she
proceeded
became
slower
his
countenance
less
furiously
agitated
by
insensible
degrees
he
approached
and
at
length
stood
with
folded
arms
immediately
before
our
heroine
julia
exerted
on
this
occasion
but
a
small
share
of
the
power
of
voice
which
she
possessed
yet
every
one
was
delighted
with
the
magical
effect
the
then
state
of
her
own
feelings
gave
to
a
pathetic
air
by
the
time
the
song
came
to
its
conclusion
sir
archibald
was
standing
almost
directly
beneath
the
great
centre
lustre
just
so
far
removed
from
its
immediate
perpendicular
as
to
admit
of
its
strong
flood
of
light
streaming
full
on
his
face
and
figure
his
attitude
was
still
the
fixed
one
in
which
he
had
hitherto
listened
but
now
he
seemed
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
any
one
his
perfectly
white
hair
was
made
more
remarkable
by
the
brightness
that
shone
upon
it
his
countenance
was
calm
every
passion
being
stilled
every
effort
laid
aside
while
an
expression
of
woe
of
hopelessness
such
as
can
proceed
only
from
the
utterly
broken
heart
had
settled
on
every
thus
relaxed
feature
and
large
tears
which
glittered
in
the
strong
light
were
silently
rolling
over
his
cheeks
an
absolute
stillness
reigned
throughout
the
apartment
for
some
moments
when
supper
being
announced
it
was
agreed
almost
in
whispers
that
they
should
retire
quietly
to
the
eating
room
without
disturbing
sir
archibald
leaving
a
servant
at
the
door
to
observe
his
movements
chapter
ix
hell
informed
passion
said
lady
morven
as
she
lolled
back
in
her
seat
at
the
supper
table
after
asking
graham
to
help
her
to
some
wine
and
water
nerves
stand
such
alarms
and
i
dare
say
you
are
quite
ill
too
is
the
first
time
sir
archy
has
shewn
symptoms
of
violence
observed
lady
arandale
he
has
been
quite
harmless
an
object
more
of
commiseration
than
of
must
i
believe
said
lord
arandale
under
the
necessity
of
requesting
my
nephew
aubin
to
take
a
few
days
sport
with
some
of
the
neighbouring
gentlemen
while
sir
archibald
remains
here
for
never
shall
my
door
and
he
spoke
with
the
honest
energy
of
good
feeling
closed
against
the
shattered
remnant
in
mind
and
in
body
which
still
exists
of
poor
once
gay
companion
of
many
a
merry
many
a
thoughtless
hour
spent
some
of
them
beneath
his
own
hospitable
roof
where
even
i
may
have
possibly
though
innocently
contributed
my
share
to
his
ultimate
ruin
then
addressing
our
hero
in
particular
he
continued
the
age
of
fifteen
he
was
his
own
master
and
at
that
early
period
commenced
the
career
of
folly
dissipation
and
gaming
which
led
finally
to
his
destruction
aubin
was
one
of
the
set
he
proceeded
lowering
his
tone
was
he
who
drew
him
into
high
play
and
who
won
from
him
the
principal
part
of
his
estates
unfairly
too
it
is
generally
believed
there
was
some
agreement
also
about
the
winner
paying
the
then
existing
debts
but
when
aubin
got
possession
he
sold
the
estates
or
his
interest
in
them
to
jews
and
disappeared
leaving
oswald
to
answer
his
creditors
as
he
might
there
were
informalities
in
the
sale
it
is
thought
but
however
that
is
or
was
the
jews
keep
possession
and
oswald
has
not
a
title
or
paper
of
any
kind
to
shew
aubin
on
various
pretexts
had
got
all
into
his
own
hands
poor
state
of
mind
too
adds
greatly
to
the
difficulty
of
clearing
up
any
part
of
the
unfortunate
business
in
some
of
his
ravings
he
declares
vehemently
that
he
staked
but
his
own
life
use
and
that
could
he
find
the
villain
aubin
and
make
him
produce
certain
papers
his
boy
boy
i
mean
would
enjoy
the
whole
property
at
his
chapter
x
are
ye
gone
indeed
ye
happy
hours
when
our
course
in
the
chace
was
one
when
we
changed
the
words
of
love
beneath
thy
shadiest
woods
oh
cromla
julia
entered
her
room
arm
and
arm
with
frances
pondering
in
what
words
she
should
ask
a
certain
question
which
she
meant
to
put
to
her
sister
as
soon
as
alice
should
retire
for
remarks
had
aroused
again
some
of
the
painful
suspicions
which
soothing
attentions
had
so
lately
laid
asleep
frances
made
many
droll
critiques
in
french
on
lady
morven
graham
forced
unmeaning
smiles
were
only
replies
at
length
both
the
heads
were
laid
on
their
downy
pillows
and
alice
had
left
the
room
still
julia
had
not
determined
in
what
precise
words
to
put
her
important
question
besides
though
the
candles
had
been
extinguished
there
happened
to
be
an
impertinent
bit
of
trundling
coal
among
the
embers
of
the
fire
which
sent
from
its
side
a
bright
flickering
blaze
and
caused
a
most
obtrusive
light
to
enter
the
bed
by
means
of
a
small
neglected
opening
between
the
foot
curtains
and
until
it
should
be
quite
dark
julia
did
not
wish
to
speak
frances
put
her
arms
about
her
neck
kissed
her
and
bade
her
good
night
julia
returned
the
good
night
with
equal
kindness
as
was
their
custom
she
was
again
silent
at
last
the
blaze
went
out
and
the
room
became
nearly
dark
were
we
were
dressing
for
dinner
edmund
you
know
frances
with
a
start
for
she
had
just
dropped
asleep
it
you
were
dinner
you
know
about
what
edmund
you
about
edmund
you
know
about
him
and
lady
susan
you
about
their
going
to
be
married
said
frances
rousing
herself
to
enter
fully
as
it
were
into
the
amusing
subject
then
with
animation
and
a
voice
of
confidence
she
continued
really
think
it
will
take
place
and
he
is
certainly
very
fortunate
for
she
has
a
cheerful
happy
temper
and
her
affection
for
him
is
truly
generous
and
disinterested
the
darkness
covered
changing
colour
and
her
starting
tears
also
which
she
now
gulped
down
as
she
replied
affection
indeed
what
can
her
affection
be
in
comparison
of
those
who
have
loved
him
always
you
mean
any
one
in
particular
asked
frances
replied
julia
i
mean
you
and
i
you
said
frances
have
loved
him
always
but
then
you
know
we
are
not
going
to
marry
i
suppose
papa
would
not
think
it
right
if
we
were
said
julia
may
be
sure
of
that
replied
frances
is
very
plain
from
his
letters
and
from
what
grandmamma
and
jackson
said
the
other
day
about
nonsense
what
sort
of
people
papa
intends
us
to
shall
never
marry
any
one
while
i
live
said
julia
with
great
earnestness
tell
you
know
julia
replied
frances
may
happen
to
fall
in
love
and
if
you
do
it
will
be
desperately
for
you
know
how
enthusiastic
you
always
are
about
any
one
you
care
for
in
love
with
a
stranger
indeed
exclaimed
julia
then
after
a
momentary
pause
she
added
you
think
yourself
frances
that
lady
susan
can
possibly
love
him
as
well
we
do
i
dare
say
replied
frances
any
thing
should
prevent
their
being
married
that
lady
susan
would
forget
him
by
and
bye
whereas
you
and
i
shall
always
have
the
same
regard
for
edmund
that
we
have
had
for
him
all
our
lives
but
on
the
other
hand
there
is
lady
susan
going
to
waive
all
about
his
unknown
birth
that
some
people
you
know
are
so
ill
natured
about
she
says
his
own
nobility
is
more
to
her
than
any
he
could
derive
from
all
the
ancestors
that
ever
were
in
the
she
say
so
to
you
frances
asked
julia
replied
her
sister
she
is
going
she
says
to
give
him
most
cheerfully
her
hand
her
heart
and
her
fifty
thousand
pounds
in
preference
to
many
of
the
first
young
noblemen
in
the
kingdom
among
whom
she
might
choose
and
you
and
i
are
not
going
to
do
all
that
for
him
you
know
julia
sighed
heavily
and
made
no
immediate
a
little
time
she
said
you
think
frances
you
could
do
so
much
for
edmund
i
know
replied
frances
i
certainly
love
edmund
next
to
you
and
grandmamma
yet
i
have
no
particular
wish
to
be
married
to
him
for
i
can
love
him
just
as
well
you
know
when
he
is
married
to
lady
susan
but
you
julia
who
were
always
so
enthusiastic
would
you
like
now
to
sacrifice
so
much
for
him
could
do
any
thing
for
those
i
love
said
julia
in
a
scarcely
audible
whisper
and
blushing
though
none
could
see
her
that
is
you
mean
if
it
were
absolutely
necessary
to
their
happiness
rejoined
her
sister
should
not
like
either
to
make
poor
edmund
unhappy
but
then
you
know
it
is
not
necessary
to
his
happiness
for
he
wishes
himself
to
be
married
to
lady
are
you
sure
of
that
frances
asked
julia
as
recollections
crowded
in
upon
her
mind
you
sure
of
that
for
i
am
certain
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
love
lady
susan
or
any
one
as
much
he
is
seems
to
he
has
always
know
said
frances
there
can
not
be
a
more
amiable
or
affectionate
disposition
in
the
world
than
yet
still
he
never
showed
me
any
such
excessive
sort
of
love
that
he
could
not
love
another
person
as
well
or
better
i
suppose
if
he
were
going
to
be
married
to
them
but
to
be
sure
you
were
always
his
favourite
i
remember
when
we
were
children
i
used
to
be
vexed
at
it
sometimes
but
since
we
have
been
grown
up
i
mind
people
loving
you
best
because
i
know
you
deserve
julia
wept
on
her
breast
and
persuaded
herself
that
her
tears
were
those
of
gratitude
and
tenderness
caused
by
kind
expressions
in
a
little
time
she
said
how
are
you
sure
frances
that
edmund
wishes
to
be
married
to
lady
susan
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
when
they
were
in
the
cottage
this
morning
she
told
me
so
herself
just
before
i
came
up
to
dress
for
dinner
you
julia
asked
no
more
questions
nor
did
she
utter
another
word
that
night
frances
went
on
explaining
about
lord
and
lady
arandale
knowing
nothing
of
the
matter
as
yet
and
what
lady
susan
meant
to
do
to
obtain
their
consent
but
having
the
conversation
all
to
herself
she
soon
began
to
articulate
slowly
and
with
frequent
unnecessary
pauses
and
finally
fell
asleep
upon
which
julia
began
to
draw
her
hitherto
suppressed
sighs
audibly
she
wept
for
a
time
with
bitterness
she
thought
for
hours
when
she
recollected
looks
or
words
of
tenderness
she
wept
afresh
but
when
she
called
to
mind
such
circumstances
as
having
at
any
time
taken
her
hand
in
his
or
pressed
it
to
his
lips
she
blushed
till
her
cheeks
seemed
to
burn
and
wondered
how
she
could
ever
have
permitted
any
thing
so
very
wrong
she
had
always
called
him
brother
edmund
certainly
but
she
ought
to
have
remembered
that
he
was
not
really
her
brother
she
then
asked
herself
the
following
startling
questions
her
feelings
for
edmund
and
her
conduct
towards
him
had
hitherto
been
guided
by
the
friendship
of
a
sister
why
should
they
not
be
still
the
same
what
change
had
taken
place
in
their
relative
situations
this
candid
mode
of
treating
the
subject
puzzled
her
not
a
little
at
length
she
tried
to
persuade
herself
that
friendship
or
even
sisterly
regard
for
one
who
loved
their
friend
or
sister
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
was
a
very
different
thing
from
friendship
for
one
who
felt
a
stronger
affection
for
some
other
object
does
edmund
then
really
love
lady
susan
better
than
he
loves
me
her
tears
now
flowed
again
and
wearied
out
she
fell
asleep
without
having
come
to
any
conclusion
but
that
she
was
wretched
and
that
all
the
recollections
which
hitherto
had
given
her
pleasure
now
gave
her
pain
as
soon
as
reason
had
abdicated
her
seat
fancy
ascended
the
throne
confusion
succeeded
and
the
busy
turmoil
of
weary
imaginings
and
painful
contrarieties
robbed
sleep
of
her
healing
balm
wanderings
alone
on
starless
wildernesses
in
the
blaze
of
noon
without
one
living
object
to
be
leading
lady
susan
past
to
join
the
dance
with
a
countenance
so
changed
so
cold
and
all
interspersed
with
short
glimpses
of
lodore
and
happy
childhood
till
at
length
by
the
time
she
ought
to
have
been
awaking
in
the
morning
her
dream
from
conclusions
but
from
outward
causes
took
the
following
form
she
thought
she
saw
edmund
and
lady
susan
coming
towards
her
in
one
of
the
shrubbery
walks
at
arandale
she
tried
to
avoid
them
but
could
scarcely
move
an
inch
at
a
time
they
overtook
her
edmund
she
thought
to
her
utter
astonishment
put
one
arm
round
her
and
drew
her
towards
him
while
the
other
she
now
perceived
was
around
lady
susan
amazed
at
this
audacious
freedom
and
especially
indignant
at
such
partnership
in
love
she
struggled
to
free
herself
and
with
almost
a
bound
awoke
arms
really
were
around
her
laughing
eyes
were
close
to
and
a
soft
voice
named
her
but
it
was
that
of
frances
who
had
all
this
time
been
trying
every
means
but
hitherto
in
vain
to
awake
her
sister
so
heavy
was
the
late
sleep
induced
by
the
anxious
thoughts
of
the
night
and
the
busy
dreams
of
the
morning
indeed
it
was
not
quite
two
hours
since
julia
had
first
closed
her
eyes
me
cried
alice
as
she
entered
the
room
that
be
the
bagpipes
for
breakfast
and
it
has
only
just
gone
ten
well
i
thought
my
lady
arandale
would
have
taken
a
sleep
this
morning
after
being
up
a
matter
of
half
the
we
so
much
later
than
usual
then
asked
frances
as
common
my
lady
replied
alice
when
the
men
went
in
to
take
the
supper
things
away
my
lady
and
my
lord
both
were
so
busy
with
edmund
captain
montgomery
i
should
say
that
they
were
sent
away
again
and
not
rung
for
for
two
hours
i
wish
all
may
be
true
that
was
said
in
the
hall
she
recommenced
after
having
assisted
her
young
ladies
to
dress
for
some
time
in
silence
edmund
is
one
that
every
body
loves
and
i
for
one
should
rejoice
in
his
good
think
it
nothing
so
strange
neither
though
the
old
butler
put
himself
in
such
a
passion
and
said
that
lady
susan
was
a
wife
for
the
first
duke
in
the
have
told
you
before
alice
said
julia
making
an
effort
to
conceal
her
real
feelings
under
the
mask
of
pettishness
you
are
not
to
repeat
the
conversations
of
the
in
our
beg
pardon
my
lady
but
i
only
meant
to
say
as
how
my
lady
arandale
came
to
be
late
but
i
am
sure
i
repeated
nothing
neither
what
my
lady
maid
said
nor
what
my
lady
maid
said
nor
what
my
man
said
about
the
time
they
were
at
lodore
nor
all
i
said
myself
about
the
power
of
money
that
edmund
had
won
from
the
french
and
about
what
a
nice
handsome
young
gentleman
he
was
for
just
a
kind
wish
for
one
that
every
one
loves
i
think
it
would
have
given
can
never
give
offence
by
wishing
well
to
any
one
alice
said
frances
it
was
not
necessary
to
repeat
what
other
servants
said
that
was
all
i
suppose
she
added
in
an
under
tone
to
her
sister
as
they
went
down
stairs
together
was
asking
papa
and
consent
last
night
and
after
his
fine
resolutions
too
she
added
laughing
to
think
of
marriage
till
he
had
discovered
all
about
his
birth
name
and
so
chapter
xi
will
wait
in
vain
thy
at
breakfast
sir
archibald
was
again
the
subject
of
conversation
is
still
late
to
his
breakfast
said
lady
arandale
when
he
does
come
he
will
tack
but
one
cup
coffee
without
sugar
cream
or
bread
so
totally
have
his
excesses
destroyed
his
stomach
dreadfully
broken
down
he
is
in
appearance
since
i
last
saw
him
observed
the
general
said
lord
arandale
oswald
was
once
i
think
the
handsomest
fellow
in
scotland
do
you
remember
how
well
he
used
to
sing
general
voice
is
still
peculiarly
melodious
said
lady
susan
who
was
looking
as
grave
as
she
had
done
at
dinner
the
day
before
though
edmund
was
seated
next
to
her
and
seemingly
paying
her
very
solicitous
attention
poor
maria
could
have
given
aubin
the
preference
continued
his
lordship
can
not
imagine
oswald
however
married
a
very
elegant
of
the
ladies
allan
your
friend
lord
first
wife
he
added
turning
to
edmund
one
of
the
sisters
the
family
seem
to
have
modelled
their
conduct
towards
poor
lady
oswald
by
that
of
her
own
more
immediate
relatives
indeed
it
is
not
improbable
that
they
may
have
by
this
time
forgotten
her
very
existence
for
the
death
of
her
sister
and
lord
second
marriage
have
for
many
years
sundered
the
connecting
link
while
a
feeling
of
pride
very
natural
i
allow
but
which
lady
oswald
certainly
ought
to
have
sacrificed
to
the
good
of
her
child
has
hitherto
i
apprehend
prevented
her
making
any
direct
claim
on
their
the
mention
of
lord
family
as
connected
with
the
oswalds
made
a
lively
impression
on
mind
that
the
friendless
destitute
boy
whom
he
had
been
planning
to
protect
and
assist
with
all
the
limited
means
he
could
command
should
possess
legitimate
claims
on
his
powerful
and
kind
patron
and
on
his
young
friend
oscar
ormond
opened
new
and
flattering
prospects
for
the
son
of
poor
sir
archibald
of
which
edmund
was
determined
not
to
lose
sight
the
friendless
the
destitute
seemed
to
him
as
more
peculiarly
his
brethren
than
the
rest
of
mankind
nor
was
this
a
parade
of
sentiment
with
edmund
even
to
his
own
heart
it
was
rather
an
involuntary
emotion
upon
the
impulse
of
which
he
frequently
acted
before
he
had
considered
what
were
his
motives
his
affectionate
and
gentle
nature
yearned
for
the
tender
family
sympathies
of
which
his
peculiar
circumstances
deprived
him
and
he
sometimes
took
a
melancholy
pleasure
in
thinking
that
he
thus
belonged
to
a
large
family
namely
the
unfortunates
henry
entered
the
looking
very
pale
is
no
one
missing
now
but
poor
sir
archibald
observed
lady
arandale
the
butler
came
in
with
a
supply
of
hot
rolls
her
ladyship
enquired
if
any
one
had
been
in
sir
room
this
morning
the
man
answered
that
he
believed
sir
archibald
had
left
the
castle
as
he
had
gone
out
very
early
he
has
gone
off
in
this
sudden
manner
observed
lord
arandale
is
probable
that
a
lucid
interval
has
arrived
for
at
such
times
he
always
hastens
to
his
miserable
retreat
in
the
island
avoiding
most
especially
those
old
friends
and
associates
whose
society
he
seeks
when
his
mind
is
in
an
unsettled
state
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
ever
seen
on
his
countenance
that
expression
of
utter
woe
unmingled
with
cheating
phantasies
which
it
wore
last
night
except
on
the
approach
of
reason
before
which
it
is
feasible
to
suppose
that
all
the
airy
visions
of
the
madman
flee
away
reducing
our
poor
friend
to
the
unalleviated
consciousness
of
his
actual
situation
young
men
continued
the
earl
looking
round
at
his
nephews
who
were
busily
engaged
in
eating
cold
pie
i
need
not
no
one
need
preach
against
gambling
in
this
neighbourhood
while
such
a
beacon
light
is
placed
on
high
to
warn
all
off
the
rock
on
which
poor
oswald
became
a
wreck
aye
a
piteous
wreck
indeed
he
added
murmuring
to
himself
and
moving
his
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
as
montgomery
sometimes
did
for
it
was
a
family
symptom
then
after
a
pause
addressing
edmund
in
particular
he
said
will
make
some
little
alteration
necessary
in
the
arrangements
we
concerted
last
night
you
have
breakfasted
i
believe
captain
montgomery
edmund
assented
you
come
with
me
then
to
my
study
edmund
arose
and
accompanied
his
lordship
most
of
the
party
quitted
their
seats
about
the
same
time
and
frances
said
to
julia
as
they
walked
together
towards
a
window
seems
edmund
has
got
over
all
his
mighty
objections
to
matrimony
are
in
a
wonderful
hurry
it
would
appear
said
julia
what
can
sir
going
away
have
to
do
with
their
arrangements
can
not
imagine
replied
frances
edmund
is
about
to
turn
out
to
be
sir
son
you
know
returned
julia
who
had
inwardly
studied
the
subject
in
all
its
bearings
mentioned
as
a
boy
besides
he
is
living
with
lady
oswald
in
the
isle
of
man
and
never
was
lost
or
found
in
infancy
as
edmund
is
true
answered
frances
he
must
be
some
way
related
to
sir
archibald
for
what
my
uncle
said
must
mean
something
and
in
that
case
i
dare
say
they
will
consent
to
the
julia
looked
at
lady
susan
and
again
wondered
why
she
did
not
look
happy
is
a
good
lad
that
captain
montgomery
observed
lady
arandale
lad
is
a
term
applied
by
elderly
scotch
ladies
to
all
men
of
all
sizes
and
ages
not
quite
as
old
as
themselves
has
made
a
good
sum
of
money
it
seems
continued
her
ladyship
will
make
a
very
good
use
of
it
i
dare
lady
susan
coloured
slightly
and
told
henry
he
had
eaten
no
breakfast
you
all
prepared
for
the
young
ladies
inquired
lady
arandale
had
better
arrange
how
the
carriages
shall
be
is
my
barouche
for
any
one
that
likes
said
lady
morven
i
shall
positively
go
in
the
curricle
with
can
accommodate
two
ladies
said
julia
henry
and
captain
montgomery
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
named
edmund
captain
montgomery
and
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
pronouncing
the
words
startled
her
is
no
scarcity
of
carriages
my
dear
replied
lady
arandale
is
my
barouche
and
my
chariot
and
the
family
coach
and
the
barouche
and
all
the
young
curricles
and
nondescripts
i
only
mean
to
plan
how
the
several
parties
may
like
best
to
be
disposed
of
as
for
my
lady
barouche
i
advise
that
none
who
regard
their
necks
may
trust
themselves
with
her
interrupted
lady
morven
would
drive
any
thing
but
fancy
my
dear
returned
lady
arandale
lord
drives
as
good
horses
as
your
ladyship
though
they
are
not
mad
ones
it
was
but
the
last
races
you
know
that
one
of
your
leaders
killed
an
unfortunate
beg
your
pardon
a
thousand
times
observed
graham
that
certainly
was
the
own
so
pray
the
boy
should
have
staid
at
home
and
i
will
venture
to
affirm
that
lady
leader
would
never
have
hurt
him
really
such
creatures
should
keep
themselves
from
under
the
feet
of
people
of
happened
on
the
highway
retorted
lady
arandale
people
of
fashion
have
no
right
to
infest
that
with
animals
dangerous
or
even
inconvenient
to
the
poorest
of
his
subjects
and
as
for
my
lady
morven
if
she
takes
my
advice
she
will
appear
on
the
ground
in
my
barouche
rather
than
in
an
open
carriage
with
any
cried
lady
morven
i
had
used
my
own
barouche
i
should
have
sat
in
the
dicky
seat
with
graham
and
made
him
drive
my
dear
if
your
husband
chooses
to
give
you
your
own
way
said
the
old
lady
shall
not
give
morven
his
own
way
and
he
gives
me
mine
all
fair
you
lady
arandale
without
vouchsafing
further
reply
desired
her
daughter
and
nieces
to
get
ready
as
the
carriages
would
all
come
round
in
half
an
hour
chapter
xii
my
youth
to
mix
with
meanwhile
we
shall
just
step
into
the
library
and
see
what
lord
arandale
and
edmund
have
been
about
may
now
i
believe
consider
matters
settled
remarked
his
lordship
as
he
folded
a
letter
which
edmund
having
perused
had
just
returned
to
him
know
what
are
her
wishes
and
i
can
i
think
answer
for
her
cheerful
consent
indeed
she
will
i
make
no
doubt
rejoice
in
having
found
such
a
friend
and
protector
for
her
good
opinion
is
truly
flattering
replied
edmund
i
hope
when
the
well
being
and
i
may
perhaps
say
happiness
through
life
of
a
young
and
innocent
being
are
committed
to
my
keeping
i
may
not
undertake
the
charge
with
light
or
careless
ideas
of
its
so
as
frances
would
say
they
really
are
going
to
be
married
your
principles
captain
montgomery
there
can
be
little
doubt
of
your
fulfilling
well
any
duties
you
take
upon
yourself
if
the
boy
is
tolerably
well
disposed
he
has
every
chance
in
such
hands
of
turning
out
an
honour
to
his
profession
though
it
can
fall
to
the
lot
of
but
few
to
adorn
it
quite
as
brilliantly
as
captain
montgomery
has
done
lord
arandale
is
speaking
of
young
oswald
sir
boy
and
the
letter
which
he
has
just
finished
folding
he
is
we
perceive
now
directing
to
lady
oswald
the
mother
in
fact
edmund
had
applied
to
his
lordship
the
night
before
for
the
purpose
of
having
it
thus
arranged
he
felt
a
delicacy
as
a
total
stranger
in
obtruding
his
offers
of
service
on
lady
oswald
and
had
requested
lord
arandale
to
take
on
the
plea
of
his
long
friendship
for
sir
archibald
nominally
the
lead
in
the
business
by
addressing
a
letter
to
her
ladyship
saying
that
he
had
now
an
opportunity
of
placing
her
son
in
the
euphrasia
frigate
commanded
by
captain
montgomery
and
stating
that
the
attending
circumstances
were
particularly
favourable
as
young
oswald
would
thus
have
an
opportunity
of
forming
a
desirable
intimacy
with
his
cousin
lord
ormond
who
was
the
particular
friend
of
captain
montgomery
and
of
becoming
personally
known
to
lord
who
it
could
not
be
doubted
would
take
an
interest
in
the
advancement
of
so
near
a
connexion
when
thus
placed
within
the
sphere
of
his
observation
on
the
strength
of
a
lady
not
understanding
those
matters
the
gentlemen
ventured
to
enclose
a
bank
bill
for
a
moderate
sum
as
advance
of
pay
to
oswald
for
his
fitting
out
chapter
xiii
are
his
yellow
locks
and
sparkling
eyes
and
beaming
features
all
in
the
fair
glow
of
the
letter
being
despatched
lord
arandale
and
edmund
rejoined
the
ladies
who
were
collecting
in
the
edmund
looked
into
every
recess
of
every
window
and
cast
a
glance
over
every
group
but
evidently
saw
not
the
object
of
his
researches
he
passed
on
to
the
greenhouse
and
at
length
discovered
julia
and
frances
collecting
some
flowers
he
went
towards
them
offering
to
assist
them
for
he
had
been
so
much
engaged
with
lady
susan
and
lord
arandale
during
breakfast
that
he
had
scarcely
spoken
to
julia
that
morning
is
it
possible
said
frances
laughing
amid
your
important
arrangements
you
can
spare
time
for
an
occupation
so
trifling
important
arrangements
as
you
call
them
replied
edmund
smiling
in
his
turn
all
said
frances
papa
and
consent
obtained
what
do
you
know
about
it
frances
asked
edmund
with
some
surprise
and
colouring
at
the
idea
that
his
benevolent
purpose
should
be
thus
made
public
we
know
quite
well
i
assure
you
she
replied
playfully
me
do
that
for
you
julia
said
edmund
starting
forward
to
assist
her
he
named
in
plucking
a
branch
of
geranium
which
she
was
very
awkwardly
attempting
to
reach
heavens
julia
what
is
the
matter
he
exclaimed
catching
up
her
hand
for
in
presenting
the
flower
he
had
just
pulled
he
perceived
that
her
countenance
expressed
the
utmost
wretchedness
and
that
her
tears
in
despite
of
an
evident
struggle
to
suppress
them
were
falling
fast
she
turned
away
drew
her
hand
forcibly
out
of
his
and
hurried
to
a
further
part
of
the
greenhouse
he
thought
of
the
hand
he
had
seen
her
give
to
henry
permit
him
to
retain
so
long
and
even
raise
to
his
lips
and
a
vague
sensation
of
pain
and
dread
came
over
him
he
followed
her
however
he
found
her
hastily
drying
her
eyes
again
she
endeavoured
to
avoid
him
have
no
right
he
said
detaining
her
demand
your
confidence
julia
perhaps
i
am
guilty
of
impertinence
in
thus
seeking
it
if
it
must
be
so
but
do
not
make
me
miserable
by
seeming
not
only
unhappy
but
seriously
offended
with
me
his
voice
and
manner
renewed
habitual
feelings
of
tenderness
have
no
desire
to
make
you
miserable
edmund
i
wish
you
sincerely
wish
you
all
happiness
she
replied
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
do
not
speak
to
me
now
do
not
speak
to
me
just
now
he
endeavoured
to
take
her
hand
and
was
about
to
reply
but
she
shrunk
from
his
touch
and
hastened
as
for
refuge
into
the
midst
of
the
company
in
the
he
followed
and
stood
near
her
in
silence
frances
had
quitted
the
greenhouse
as
soon
as
she
made
her
laughing
speech
to
edmund
and
consequently
without
perceiving
her
emotion
at
this
moment
colonel
murray
of
the
moorlands
was
announced
he
led
by
the
hand
a
fine
boy
of
about
twelve
or
thirteen
with
fair
curly
glossy
hair
fair
skin
glowing
cheeks
soft
hazel
eyes
and
a
sweet
open
expression
of
countenance
the
mouth
and
smile
as
was
afterwards
universally
observed
very
like
he
was
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
one
of
the
highland
hunts
and
carried
in
his
hand
a
cap
and
plume
like
young
is
arthur
oswald
the
son
of
our
friend
sir
archibald
said
the
laird
presenting
him
to
lord
arandale
cried
his
lordship
taking
the
hand
and
glancing
a
look
towards
edmund
which
was
answered
by
one
of
intelligence
on
his
part
am
truly
happy
to
see
little
fellow
how
did
you
leave
your
mamma
my
dear
well
i
hope
was
quite
well
when
we
came
away
he
answered
a
good
while
the
laird
explained
that
arthur
had
been
brought
over
to
the
mainland
by
his
father
who
had
left
him
at
his
the
house
since
his
first
arrival
the
laird
added
that
he
was
taking
arthur
with
him
to
the
races
and
had
called
at
arandale
for
the
purpose
of
joining
himself
if
permitted
to
their
agreeable
party
he
might
have
said
further
but
of
course
he
did
not
that
he
had
furnished
arthur
with
the
becoming
dress
he
wore
on
the
occasion
every
one
noticed
the
young
stranger
in
some
kind
or
complimentary
manner
and
lord
arandale
presenting
him
particularly
to
edmund
asked
him
if
he
should
like
to
be
a
sailor
the
boy
answered
with
quickness
and
energy
that
he
should
indeed
this
gentleman
said
the
earl
take
you
with
him
and
teach
you
to
be
a
sailor
and
a
good
and
a
great
one
if
you
follow
his
edmund
had
already
taken
hand
drawn
him
towards
him
and
seemed
as
it
were
to
appropriate
him
the
boy
now
looked
up
in
his
face
as
if
for
a
confirmation
of
what
lord
arandale
had
said
edmund
smiled
kindly
and
arthur
answered
the
smile
by
that
genuine
mark
of
a
confidence
a
soft
pressure
of
the
hand
that
held
his
edmund
felt
at
the
moment
notwithstanding
the
strangeness
of
manner
that
it
was
impossible
to
be
quite
miserable
while
one
has
the
power
of
doing
any
good
this
pleasurable
impulse
called
up
the
natural
ambition
of
the
heart
to
be
happy
and
scarcely
conscious
why
he
turned
to
julia
but
found
what
he
had
never
found
before
this
morning
that
he
could
not
meet
her
eye
he
moved
a
step
or
two
which
brought
him
near
her
he
addressed
some
remark
to
her
she
answered
without
looking
up
affecting
to
be
very
busy
searching
for
something
in
her
reticule
it
must
have
been
thought
edmund
the
imprudence
with
which
i
last
night
betrayed
my
feelings
which
has
thus
upon
serious
consideration
offended
her
though
at
the
time
she
did
not
certainly
show
displeasure
and
he
sighed
heavily
she
now
raised
her
eyes
with
involuntary
quickness
to
his
face
she
had
never
seen
so
much
unhappiness
there
she
looked
at
him
for
the
space
of
a
second
with
a
mingled
expression
of
surprise
and
tenderness
which
he
could
in
no
way
comprehend
edmund
stooped
and
on
pretence
of
looking
over
her
shoulder
out
of
a
window
facing
which
she
stood
he
whispered
softly
see
julia
that
the
presumption
of
my
manner
last
night
has
offended
you
justly
i
allow
but
have
some
compassion
for
an
involuntary
error
some
pity
the
low
and
hurried
accents
of
edmund
the
confused
state
of
own
feelings
the
busy
voices
of
the
rest
of
the
party
all
prevented
her
hearing
more
than
a
few
occasional
words
from
which
she
collected
only
that
edmund
saw
her
change
of
manner
and
sought
to
know
the
cause
this
of
course
she
could
not
explain
i
must
return
to
sea
he
continued
finding
he
could
obtain
neither
look
nor
word
what
foreign
station
or
for
how
many
years
i
know
not
possibly
i
may
never
see
you
again
julia
do
not
then
by
a
resentment
so
determined
so
unforgiving
embitter
the
few
short
moments
to
which
i
would
fondly
cling
as
the
only
solace
of
my
solitary
and
hopeless
existence
this
last
sentence
which
from
the
growing
warmth
of
his
manner
was
uttered
in
a
somewhat
more
audible
tone
than
the
rest
was
all
that
julia
had
distinctly
heard
solitary
and
hopeless
existence
edmund
she
exclaimed
with
a
look
and
voice
of
astonishment
julia
such
feelings
as
mine
must
be
hopeless
it
is
the
only
apology
that
can
be
made
for
their
arandale
has
refused
his
consent
thought
julia
shall
i
add
to
his
evident
affliction
i
imagined
him
perfectly
happy
and
that
he
had
found
means
to
be
so
independent
of
all
his
first
friends
or
i
could
never
have
been
so
unkind
to
at
the
conclusion
of
this
reflection
she
looked
up
with
an
expression
that
for
a
moment
almost
restored
him
to
happiness
the
company
were
now
filing
off
on
their
way
down
to
the
carriages
edmund
and
julia
were
the
last
in
the
room
she
paused
gave
him
her
hand
and
said
once
promised
you
to
be
always
your
friend
i
renew
that
promise
now
and
i
know
i
can
also
answer
for
the
unshaken
continuance
of
kind
regard
will
this
in
any
degree
console
you
edmund
under
those
mortified
and
disappointed
feelings
of
which
you
speak
so
bitterly
and
she
spoke
a
little
bitterly
herself
yes
it
does
he
exclaimed
pressing
the
offered
hand
to
his
lips
she
drew
it
gently
away
but
took
his
arm
as
they
followed
the
rest
of
the
party
if
he
considered
it
so
very
wrong
even
to
hope
she
thought
why
did
he
ask
her
to
marry
him
and
lady
susan
herself
had
told
frances
that
he
had
done
so
edmund
was
or
at
least
believed
that
he
ought
to
have
been
cheered
in
one
point
of
view
for
julia
appeared
to
be
reconciled
to
him
appeared
to
have
pardoned
his
rashness
but
he
was
saddened
too
indeed
there
was
a
peculiar
dreariness
about
his
present
feelings
for
it
now
seemed
to
him
that
they
fully
understood
each
other
and
that
julia
had
forbid
him
to
hope
yet
he
thought
he
had
never
hoped
what
was
it
then
of
which
he
now
deplored
the
loss
some
undefined
unacknowledged
expectations
must
have
been
founded
on
the
pleasure
he
had
so
often
with
intoxicating
delight
marked
in
julia
when
he
had
by
look
or
word
betrayed
some
part
of
that
love
he
thought
it
his
duty
not
to
declare
till
his
birth
should
be
distinctly
ascertained
a
contingency
which
when
put
in
high
spirits
by
a
smile
he
had
sometimes
thought
by
no
means
improbable
now
julia
knew
he
believed
the
full
extent
of
his
love
and
she
had
showed
any
thing
but
gratification
she
had
it
is
true
mingled
with
her
displeasure
at
his
presumption
a
generous
compassion
for
his
sufferings
and
she
had
offered
him
mournfully
but
kindly
friendship
as
a
consolation
for
the
hopelessness
of
the
passion
she
had
yet
decidedly
checked
and
was
not
friendship
an
inestimable
treasure
was
he
not
an
object
of
regard
of
affection
to
her
how
delightful
that
idea
were
it
not
blasted
by
the
thought
that
he
must
one
day
see
her
bestow
warmer
dearer
fonder
feelings
on
another
on
some
one
who
having
all
else
that
this
world
can
give
must
have
their
abundance
crowned
by
the
bliss
of
possessing
love
or
should
she
ever
be
he
looked
on
her
as
he
asked
himself
this
question
but
he
thought
of
the
mountainous
waves
of
the
sea
in
a
storm
and
for
a
moment
felt
the
sinful
wish
that
he
might
be
overwhelmed
by
them
ere
so
terrible
an
apprehension
should
be
realized
julia
as
she
descended
the
stairs
and
stepped
into
the
carriage
wondered
how
edmund
could
love
a
comparative
stranger
as
lady
susan
certainly
was
so
much
as
to
be
rendered
thus
unhappy
on
her
account
but
he
was
unhappy
and
therefore
she
would
never
be
unkind
to
him
again
she
could
not
it
was
true
have
the
same
pleasure
in
feeling
that
excessive
friendship
for
him
now
as
when
she
thought
her
friendship
was
all
the
happiness
he
desired
yet
if
it
was
all
the
happiness
he
possessed
it
should
never
be
taken
from
him
before
the
company
quitted
the
for
the
carriages
a
trifling
circumstance
occurred
which
we
omitted
mentioning
in
its
place
we
shall
however
relate
it
now
as
it
may
hereafter
be
remembered
with
interest
at
the
time
that
edmund

of

side

gently
and
having
long

the
habit
of
thinking
and
speaking
of
his

a
degree
both
of
seriousness
and
of
mystery

account
of
his
unhappy

cried
frances
who

that
said
frances
now
directing
his
attention
towards
a
remarkably
handsome
young
man
who
was
riding
past
the
same
person
was
at
the
same
moment
pointed
out
to
julia
by
lord
arandale
who
had
been
describing
the
company
to
her
is
said
the
earl
marquis
of
now
julia
he
added
laughing
and
lowering
his
voice
would
be
a
conquest
worthy
of
those
beautiful
eyes
julia
scarcely
perceived
the
person
pointed
out
her
beautiful
eyes
as
her
gallant
uncle
was
pleased
to
call
them
were
following
the
figure
of
our
hero
as
he
rode
with
a
group
of
other
young
men
she
was
well
accustomed
to
edmund
standing
before
her
sitting
beside
her
or
leaning
on
the
back
of
her
chair
and
to
looks
and
whispers
dangerous
enough
in
such
situations
but
edmund
at
a
distance
and
busily
occupied
with
other
objects
and
other
people
was
something
quite
new
she
felt
without
exactly
defining
the
feeling
as
if
he
were
less
at
her
disposal
than
usual
yet
she
thought
him
handsomer
and
more
graceful
than
ever
he
did
look
to
particular
advantage
for
though
a
sailor
he
was
very
fond
of
riding
had
learned
well
and
practised
much
when
a
boy
and
never
since
that
period
missed
an
opportunity
of
enjoying
an
exercise
in
which
he
took
great
delight
he
had
also
on
becoming
possessed
of
an
independent
fortune
made
a
point
of
procuring
first
rate
horses
so
that
the
animal
he
now
rode
was
one
of
the
finest
on
the
ground
while
julia
was
thus
observing
him
he
singled
from
the
group
and
gallopped
across
the
course
at
full
speed
the
foremost
of
the
many
who
as
usual
crowded
to
reach
the
in
time
to
witness
the
result
of
the
heat
is
it
is
it
proceeded
from
numerous
voices
captain

said
one
montgomery
said
another
famous
captain

enquired
an
elderly
gentleman
who
behaved
so
well
in
the
engagements
of
and
and
with
the
fleet
under
lord
same
replied
a
second
old
gentleman
gracefully
he
sits
his
horse
exclaimed
a
young
lady
did
you
observe
she
continued
he
rode
by
slowly
a
little
while
ago
how
very
handsome
he
is
i
saw
him
at
the
time
you
speak
of
he
leaned
one
hand
on
the
back
of
the
horse
and
looked
up
at
the
stand
as
he
was
passing
i
saw
him
bow
to
some
ladies
in
the
next
window
she
added
lowering
her
voice
here
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
sudden
exclamation
of
terror
from
julia
we
left
our
hero
galloping
towards
the
winning
post
henry
had
also
been
attempting
to
reach
the
same
point
from
another
and
a
nearer
part
of
the
course
and
his
horse
had
flung
him
just
at
the
moment
when
edmund
came
up
so
that
the
immediately
leaping
down
to
assist
had
been
mistaken
by
julia
for
his
having
also
fallen
edmund
heard
her
exclamation
and
looking
up
saw
the
expression
of
alarm
on
her
countenance
he
knew
that
he
had
not
been
in
any
danger
nor
was
he
conscious
that
he
had
appeared
to
be
so
he
could
not
consequently
take
any
part
of
the
compliment
to
himself
danger
then
he
thought
has
been
the
cause
of
all
this
agony
of
dread
he
recollected
the
emotion
she
had
shewn
the
evening
before
when
sir
violent
behaviour
had
threatened
the
safety
of
henry
as
he
ascended
the
stairs
of
the
henry
followed
close
behind
and
the
next
moment
both
the
young
men
were
beside
julia
henry
insidiously
thanked
her
in
an
under
tone
but
loud
enough
for
edmund
to
hear
while
she
from
a
consciousness
of
the
true
source
of
her
emotion
coloured
deeply
without
replying
or
raising
her
eyes
this
was
not
lost
on
poor
edmund
neither
was
the
look
cast
towards
him
by
henry
and
which
seemed
to
say
see
you
have
discovered
our
secret
do
not
betray
us
the
marquis
of
now
rode
towards
the
stand
and
looking
up
bowed
to
lord
arandale
who
addressing
julia
in
the
same
jesting
strain
as
before
said
poor
friend
is
desperately
wounded
i
saw
it
in
that
one
upward
the
marquis
now
entered
and
on
being
introduced
to
our
heroine
established
himself
near
her
and
began
to
converse
with
much
ease
and
grace
while
his
whole
manner
evinced
the
liveliest
admiration
for
his
fair
companion
between
the
heats
it
is
not
unusual
for
some
of
the
company
on
the
stand
to
indulge
in
the
variety
of
a
drive
round
the
course
the
arandale
party
now
prepared
to
do
so
with
the
help
of
a
little
manœuvring
on
the
part
of
julia
such
as
pretending
not
to
hear
the
me
and
adjusting
her
scarf
and
veil
to
avoid
seeing
his
offered
arm
and
totally
disregarding
all
speeches
it
happened
that
edmund
among
so
many
competitors
was
the
fortunate
individual
who
handed
julia
down
stairs
as
they
descended
she
said
quite
suddenly
thought
at
first
edmund
that
you
too
had
fallen
how
glad
i
was
when
i
saw
that
you
had
only
leaped
down
to
assist
henry
a
thrill
of
joy
passed
through
heart
the
next
moment
he
was
obliged
to
resign
her
to
the
marquis
who
stood
at
the
carriage
door
handing
in
the
other
ladies
of
the
party
but
edmund
was
again
happy
all
his
former
sources
of
affliction
vanished
instantaneously
it
seemed
as
though
this
last
overwhelming
flood
of
fears
had
carried
with
it
as
it
ebbed
all
other
painful
feelings
she
did
not
prefer
henry
to
him
she
had
evidently
wished
to
show
that
she
did
not
in
this
moment
of
inward
sunshine
even
the
long
perspective
of
futurity
looked
bright
though
honour
now
forbade
his
seeking
the
hand
of
julia
though
a
sense
of
forbade
her
now
listening
to
any
avowal
of
his
love
his
birth
might
yet
be
proved
to
equal
hers
and
these
thoughts
presented
themselves
to
the
mind
of
our
hero
as
he
rode
beside
the
arandale
barouche
an
arm
leaning
on
the
window
conversing
with
julia
in
the
most
animated
manner
to
the
great
envy
of
a
host
of
rivals
who
were
riding
before
behind
and
beside
him
endeavouring
in
vain
to
introduce
their
horses
heads
between
the
spirited
animal
on
which
he
was
mounted
and
the
carriage
whilst
the
consequently
unequal
movements
of
the
said
animal
kept
alive
a
certain
interest
an
ever
dawning
though
as
often
repelled
anxiety
on
the
countenance
of
julia
while
she
tried
to
answer
his
remarks
with
perfect
composure
with
which
it
must
be
confessed
he
had
the
barbarity
to
be
delighted
chapter
xv
fingall
lifts
his
spear
there
will
be
and
taunt
him
to
mortal
lord
arandale
as
lord
lieutenant
of
the
county
took
the
lead
in
all
that
was
going
forward
and
desirous
to
promote
the
festivity
of
the
scene
he
gave
to
his
numerous
friends
and
acquaintance
the
additional
entertainment
of
a
splendid
luncheon
laid
in
tents
his
lordship
also
made
it
a
point
with
his
whole
party
to
dine
each
day
at
the
public
ordinary
and
attend
the
ball
each
evening
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
which
furnished
the
henry
contrived
to
hand
julia
out
of
the
carriage
and
in
consequence
he
conducted
her
up
stairs
on
the
way
he
asked
her
to
dance
with
him
she
was
previously
engaged
to
edmund
to
the
marquis
of
to
lord
morven
and
to
several
others
for
more
sets
than
it
was
probable
she
should
dance
during
the
evening
this
excuse
however
she
did
not
take
the
trouble
of
making
to
henry
but
merely
told
him
with
firmness
and
some
severity
of
manner
that
she
would
not
dance
with
him
as
she
felt
much
offended
by
the
style
of
conversation
he
had
taken
the
liberty
of
adopting
towards
her
the
evening
before
tell
you
what
julia
he
replied
leading
her
with
much
longer
steps
than
she
found
quite
convenient
round
the
side
of
the
room
which
was
as
yet
unoccupied

all
your
secrets
as
well
as
if
you
had
thought
fit
to
make
me
your
confidant
i
know
that
you
are
in
love
and
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
with
this
edmund
this
captain
montgomery
captain
nobody
although
as
i
told
you
before
he
chooses
to
prefer
lady
susan
morven
forsooth
to
your
ladyship
you
had
better
get
frances
to
join
you
i
think
strip
all
hands
and
see
who
throw
the
apple
to
that
however
is
your
affair
but
this
i
can
tell
you
if
you
treat
me
with
insult
on
his
account
and
let
such
a
fellow
see
that
you
do
so
i
know
how
to
be
revenged
and
i
will
be
revenged
dare
you
henry
said
julia
almost
breathless
between
indignation
and
mortification
dare
you
address
such
language
to
me
i
shall
let
grandmamma
know
and
you
shall
never
be
allowed
to
speak
to
me
again
quite
so
fast
madam
retorted
henry
shall
say
and
you
shall
do
what
i
please
and
only
what
i
please
or
i
repeat
it
have
revenge
she
was
about
to
speak
again
with
a
lip
the
expression
of
which
already
evinced
scorn
for
his
threats
me
he
continued
preventing
her
are
well
aware
julia
that
there
are
subjects
which
must
be
sore
ones
to
edmund
i
will
thrust
these
upon
him
in
the
most
indelicate
manner
in
short
i
will
insult
him
and
before
other
men
too
past
all
endurance
till
i
compel
him
to
a
quarrel
which
shall
end
by
ending
one
of
us
in
such
a
case
should
your
favourite
escape
with
life
which
is
not
very
probable
he
will
never
be
able
to
shew
his
face
again
among
our
julia
looked
up
petrified
with
horror
and
astonishment
he
answered
the
look
which
had
seemed
to
say
it
possible
with
i
will
do
it
and
his
eyes
remained
fixed
on
hers
till
she
shuddered
at
their
unshrinking
expression
yet
she
felt
as
if
compelled
by
some
spell
to
continue
her
gaze
meeting
his
and
suffer
him
to
read
every
thought
that
was
passing
in
her
mind
at
length
after
a
painful
pause
endeavouring
to
assume
a
firmness
which
she
was
far
from
possessing
she
replied
repeat
it
henry
it
is
not
to
you
that
i
shall
render
an
account
of
my
conduct
for
toleration
if
you
can
and
for
peace
sake
i
will
shew
it
eyes
flashed
with
rage
for
a
moment
then
bowing
he
answered
with
a
sneer
julia
is
pleased
to
condescend
and
looking
at
her
insolently
from
head
to
foot
he
laughed
with
an
expression
which
it
was
impossible
to
comprehend
yet
which
evidently
had
some
horrible
meaning
and
snatching
up
her
hand
he
almost
crushed
the
delicate
fingers
together
ere
he
again
released
it
saying
as
he
did
so
you
little
know
what
is
before
you
faith
i
can
not
help
laughing
he
continued
i
think
how
you
shall
change
your
tone
one
of
those
at
this
moment
edmund
singled
from
a
group
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
and
approached
he
came
to
claim
promised
hand
for
the
set
now
forming
and
henry
for
this
time
walked
away
without
disputing
it
how
gladly
did
she
take
the
offered
arm
of
our
hero
she
literally
clung
to
it
he
felt
her
tremble
and
turned
towards
her
with
a
look
of
anxious
enquiry
she
begged
him
to
take
her
out
of
the
room
and
get
her
a
glass
of
water
no
sooner
had
they
escaped
the
danger
of
general
observation
by
reaching
the
gallery
along
which
but
an
occasional
straggler
passed
than
she
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
she
suffered
edmund
to
take
her
hand
and
even
unconsciously
returned
the
pressure
of
his
as
notwithstanding
the
painful
suspicions
renewed
by
what
he
had
just
seen
he
tenderly
entreated
to
know
the
cause
of
her
tears
not
ask
me
edmund
do
not
ask
me
was
all
she
was
able
to
say
edmund
was
confounded
for
strange
as
were
all
the
circumstances
there
was
at
the
moment
an
unguarded
tenderness
in
her
voice
and
manner
which
seemed
to
convey
almost
conclusive
evidence
of
attachment
to
himself
yet
was
it
not
henry
who
had
caused
her
emotion
edmund
had
observed
the
deep
interest
with
which
they
had
conversed
he
had
seen
henry
take
her
hand
the
hand
he
now
held
and
he
dropped
it
at
the
recollection
as
soon
as
julia
was
able
they
returned
to
the
edmund
again
enduring
all
the
doubts
all
the
tortures
of
a
passion
debarred
from
explanation
with
its
object
they
joined
the
set
the
form
of
our
heroine
glided
along
through
the
mazes
of
the
dance
and
was
followed
by
the
eyes
of
the
enamoured
marquis
of
who
stood
with
folded
arms
contemplating
the
perfection
of
her
figure
the
unconscious
grace
of
her
movements
the
lustre
and
profusion
of
her
bright
hair
the
softness
of
her
hazel
eye
the
mantling
glow
on
her
cheek
and
the
richness
and
sweet
expression
of
her
lips
as
they
smiled
when
from
time
to
time
she
answered
or
addressed
her
partner
for
notwithstanding
her
late
agitation
she
could
not
be
partner
hear
his
voice
and
feel
the
kindness
of
his
eye
and
not
smile
an
affection
so
long
cherished
as
was
hers
an
affection
which
the
heart
can
not
do
without
induces
thus
a
secret
devotedness
of
every
feeling
which
we
are
often
ashamed
of
even
to
ourselves
yet
with
which
we
are
unable
to
contend
in
short
julia
was
already
bringing
her
mind
to
contemplate
as
a
species
of
happiness
the
idea
of
being
even
a
consolation
to
edmund
she
determined
that
when
she
went
to
her
room
at
night
she
would
ask
frances
who
seemed
to
be
in
lady
confidence
all
the
particulars
about
this
business
between
her
ladyship
and
edmund
he
had
said
that
he
had
no
hope
and
therefore
at
any
rate
he
was
not
going
to
be
married
to
lady
susan
julia
could
herself
also
remain
unmarried
and
then
they
could
according
to
her
original
plan
love
each
other
as
friends
all
their
lives
while
these
reflections
passed
across
the
mind
of
julia
the
quadrille
concluded
and
the
marquis
lost
not
a
moment
in
claiming
her
promised
hand
for
the
next
he
had
indeed
at
the
very
first
glance
been
captivated
by
her
peculiarly
luxuriant
style
of
beauty
and
he
had
subsequently
short
as
had
been
the
acquaintance
contrived
to
gaze
and
meditate
himself
into
a
passion
of
the
most
absurdly
extravagant
kind
while
not
admitting
a
doubt
of
his
own
success
he
made
up
his
mind
that
our
heroine
should
be
the
future
marchioness
of
and
accordingly
now
led
her
towards
the
set
with
almost
triumphant
feelings
these
however
being
under
the
check
of
perfect
good
breeding
so
far
from
giving
anything
offensive
to
his
manners
rather
served
to
render
them
animated
and
agreeable
his
admiration
too
though
so
lately
excited
was
perfectly
sincere
and
as
passion
however
transient
while
it
lasts
speaks
with
the
irresistible
voice
of
nature
his
mode
of
expressing
himself
could
not
fail
of
possessing
a
certain
charm
as
he
whispered
soft
speeches
in
terms
as
ardent
and
unequivocal
as
the
newness
of
his
suit
would
permit
he
was
not
a
little
disappointed
therefore
at
the
absolute
indifference
nay
almost
unconsciousness
evinced
by
absent
manner
and
languid
smile
for
she
was
thinking
of
lady
susan
of
edmund
and
more
than
all
of
threats
and
what
ought
to
be
her
own
future
conduct
in
the
course
of
the
evening
the
marquis
perceived
also
and
not
without
some
anxiety
that
he
was
likely
to
have
to
contend
with
a
numerous
host
of
rivals
not
one
of
them
true
was
quite
his
equal
either
in
rank
or
fortune
but
a
creature
so
young
as
julia
was
might
disregard
such
considerations
he
finally
determined
therefore
to
secure
lord
interest
by
letting
him
know
his
intentions
that
very
night
colonel
morven
too
by
this
time
declared
though
by
no
means
her
received
admirer
found
it
not
quite
so
easy
to
appropriate
her
hand
in
the
dance
or
her
ear
at
the
supper
table
as
he
had
done
while
none
but
the
family
party
were
present
in
short
the
sisters
were
well
known
to
be
joint
heiresses
to
the
great
estates
of
lord
and
that
such
were
the
settlements
that
his
lordship
could
not
cut
off
either
of
his
daughters
from
an
equal
share
of
the
inheritance
even
if
such
daughter
married
in
direct
opposition
to
his
wishes
in
addition
to
these
reversionary
charms
it
was
equally
well
known
that
julia
in
a
very
few
months
would
be
in
actual
possession
of
her
scotch
estate
this
property
lay
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
its
beauties
and
its
value
were
well
known
to
all
both
the
sisters
also
possessed
the
not
quite
valueless
though
less
valuable
attractions
of
youth
and
beauty
with
the
charms
of
perfect
freedom
from
affectation
and
perfect
newness
to
life
for
such
was
the
seclusion
in
which
they
had
been
educated
that
till
very
lately
they
had
not
only
never
acted
a
part
on
stage
but
never
been
even
spectators
of
any
scene
beyond
the
limit
of
the
fireside
circle
at
lodore
and
here
the
dramatis
personæ
had
generally
been
confined
to
grandmamma
edmund
jackson
henry
and
themselves
the
depth
and
continuance
of
mourning
of
the
heart
having
since
the
death
of
lady
nearly
excluded
all
other
society
can
it
then
be
wondered
at
if
the
ladies
with
so
many
circumstances
in
their
favour
formed
to
the
gentlemen
at
least
the
centre
of
attraction

but
she
the
scene
of
gaiety
and

had
closed
for
the
night
the

had
retired
to
rest
alice
and

were
dismissed
and
julia
commenced
her
intended
enquiries
but
frances
had
now
little
information
to
bestow
lady
first
confused
and
unconnected
confidence
had
been
made
immediately
on
their
return
from
the
cottage
the
day
before
after
they
had
all
dressed
for
dinner
frances
had
observed
edmund
and
lady
susan
conversing
for
a
considerable
time
apart
julia
also
had
observed
them
from
that
time
lady
susan
had
been
an
altered
creature
she
had
not
once
smiled
at
dinner
julia
had
noticed
this
also
after
dinner
lady
susan
had
gone
alone
to
her
cottage
where
she
had
remained
for
near
an
hour
on
her
return
the
traces
of
tears
had
been
visible
on
her
countenance
she
had
declined
entering
on
the
subject
and
even
requested
frances
who
had
attempted
to
introduce
it
never
again
to
mention
it
and
to
bury
what
she
had
already
told
her
for
ever
in
her
own
bosom
this
would
certainly
look
as
if
she
either
had
on
reflection
thought
it
prudent
to
retract
her
consent
to
marry
edmund
or
been
required
to
do
so
by
her
parents
how
many
anxious
moments
had
julia
been
spared
could
lady
susan
have
brought
herself
to
confess
that
her
first
confidence
had
been
founded
on
error
that
edmund
had
never
meant
to
declare
love
for
her
that
she
had
misunderstood
him
in
the
interview
at
the
cottage
and
that
he
had
sought
a
subsequent
one
to
explain
in
as
delicate
terms
as
he
could
devise
that
his
heart
was
devoted
to
another
but
no
such
explanation
having
been
made
to
frances
it
was
not
in
her
power
to
remove
her
uncomfortable
reflections
on
this
point
while
in
addition
julia
had
now
a
new
source
of
uneasiness
horrid
threats
having
filled
her
mind
with
images
of
terror
which
she
had
neither
courage
nor
knowledge
of
the
world
sufficient
to
brave
she
must
never
again
she
feared
venture
to
reject
his
conspicuous
and
now
more
than
ever
hateful
attentions
with
the
spirit
and
decision
which
her
own
feelings
dictated
she
should
be
compelled
henceforth
to
admit
them
with
passiveness
at
least
or
might
he
not
require
of
her
to
receive
them
with
seeming
pleasure
had
she
not
that
very
evening
been
obliged
to
submit
to
his
taking
her
hand
from
arm
and
leading
her
with
a
triumphant
smile
to
the
dance
after
she
had
told
lord
in
hearing
that
she
was
too
much
fatigued
to
dance
again
what
must
edmund
think
of
this
and
henry
she
saw
had
no
delicacy
for
he
had
always
taken
pains
to
make
his
attentions
most
remarkable
when
edmund
was
present
should
she
complain
of
his
conduct
to
her
if
she
did
her
grandmamma
could
not
keep
him
from
quarrelling
with
besides
the
subject
was
one
upon
which
for
many
reasons
unless
indeed
there
were
no
other
means
of
preventing
danger
to
edmund
she
should
rather
be
silent
she
must
just
only
therefore
endeavour
not
to
provoke
horrid
vindictive
temper
though
it
was
so
disagreeable
to
have
him
always
near
her
and
to
have
people
think
perhaps
that
she
wished
it

my
waking
were
peace
to
yet
it
was
not
our

on
his
pillow
instead
of
seeking
rest
from
the
hopes
and
fears
the
distracting
anxieties
of
the
day
commenced
again
in
fancy
the
busy
scene
the
undisguised
admiration
of
the
marquis
for
julia
had
awakened
new
terrors
his
addresses
would
be
approved
of
by
all
her
friends
edmund
shuddered
to
think
of
the
consequences
to
which
such
approval
might
ultimately
lead
yet
imagination
would
go
forward
devising
new
tortures
till
he
leaped
from
his
bed
threw
open
his
window
and
strove
to
force
his
thoughts
into
some
other
channel
the
remembrance
of
the
mysterious
understanding
which
seemed
to
exist
between
julia
and
henry
next
arose
like
a
spectre
and
laid
its
icy
grasp
on
every
warm
fibre
of
his
heart
the
pang
however
was
but
momentary
this
subject
had
not
yet
fastened
on
each
faculty
with
the
withering
lasting
hold
it
was
one
day
destined
to
possess
it
was
reserved
for
time
and
absence
to
weaken
the
blissful
internal
evidence
derived
from
look
voice
manner
and
to
strengthen
into
certainty
and
misery
every
vague
suspicion
to
which
any
untoward
coincidence
had
ever
given
birth
at
present
the
very
circumstances
necessarily
connected
with
such
suspicions
led
by
the
association
of
ideas
to
a
vivid
recollection
of
some
of
the
latest
and
strongest
proofs
of
tenderness
he
had
himself
ever
received
from
julia
he
now
dwelt
on
these
till
he
yielded
again
to
the
delightful
hope
that
she
really
loved
him
although
she
had
thought
it
necessary
to
check
his
mad
declaration
of
a
passion
which
could
never
meet
with
the
sanction
of
her
father
if
then
she
loved
him
surely
she
would
not
marry
another
no
she
would
reject
this
marquis
of
and
as
to
henry
she
must
have
rejected
him
already
the
emotion
she
had
shown
when
conversing
apart
with
him
must
have
been
occasioned
by
regret
at
being
obliged
to
give
pain
he
therefore
returned
to
his
pillow
and
busied
himself
in
recalling
every
look
every
word
on
which
his
hopes
of
being
secretly
beloved
were
founded
fear
and
doubt
vanished
and
fancy
for
a
few
blissful
moments
pictured
the
realization
of
all
his
hopes
but
hope
on
such
a
subject
was
not
consistent
with
honour
with
then
could
a
virtuous
mind
cling
to
it
with
unalloyed
felicity
conscience
spoke
and
demanded
a
sacrifice
sacrifice
which
the
heart
knew
not
how
to
yield
his
secret
wishes
now
seemed
his
accusers
and
dear
as
they
had
long
been
he
next
strove
to
deny
even
to
himself
their
actual
existence
but
the
compromise
was
not
accepted
still
conscience
repeated
that
it
was
his
duty
to
fly
a
temptation
which
he
evidently
had
not
strength
to
resist
should
the
discovery
of
his
birth
never
be
made
or
when
made
should
it
not
prove
such
as
to
give
him
pretensions
to
hand
was
it
consistent
with
honour
and
right
feeling
that
he
should
during
the
period
of
uncertainty
endeavour
to
gain
her
succeed
in
so
doing
but
this
thought
again
bewildered
again
left
him
incapable
of
a
rational
reflection
or
a
right
resolve
such
is
the
mental
warfare
such
the
wild
rebellion
of
will
which
lays
waste
the
peace
of
him
who
suffers
the
voice
of
passion
to
mingle
in
the
counsels
of
conscience
edmund
slept
still
undecided
and
in
his
dreams
endured
once
more
a
recapitulation
of
each
anxious
feeling
and
unfinished
conflict

not

her
whose
faith
is
why
should
these
eyes
behold
it
as
the
sisters
were
descending
to
breakfast
frances
returned
up
stairs
for
some
violets
which
alice
had
with
great
difficulty
procured
for
her
and
which
she
had
forgotten
on
her
dressing
table
while
julia
proceeded
towards
a
room
their
party
had
occupied
the
evening
before
but
on
entering
and
perceiving
henry
seated
alone
reading
a
newspaper
and
no
appearance
of
even
preparation
for
breakfast
she
was
about
to
retire
may
as
well
stay
where
you
are
i
think
said
henry
it
was
edmund
that
was
here
you
would
not
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
make
fearful
of
irritating
him
after
his
alarming
threats
of
last
night
poor
julia
directed
her
steps
to
the
furthest
removed
window
and
stood
looking
out
henry
continued
reading
for
some
time
voice
was
heard
in
the
hall
calling
to
a
favourite
dog
henry
suddenly
rose
approached
julia
knelt
on
one
knee
before
her
and
took
her
hand
she
was
surprised
for
when
alone
with
her
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
troubling
her
with
any
affectation
of
tenderness
and
she
was
particularly
sorry
that
he
had
chosen
the
present
moment
before
she
could
remonstrate
or
succeed
in
disengaging
her
hand
she
heard
footsteps
and
looking
up
saw
edmund
advancing
along
the
gallery
towards
the
door
which
she
had
left
open
for
the
purpose
of
rendering
her
unwilling
interview
with
henry
as
little
of
a
private
one
as
possible
our
hero
looked
into
the
room
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
retired
henry
after
throwing
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
rose
carelessly
and
without
taking
the
trouble
of
explaining
his
late
movement
looked
out
of
the
window
and
whistled
julia
with
tears
starting
to
her
eyes
at
length
assuming
courage
said
i
will
not
endure
this
persecution
i
will
complain
to
grandmamma
and
write
to
my
father
too
and
you
shall
not
be
allowed
either
to
trouble
me
or
any
body
had
better
i
think
he
replied
to
the
world
your
disgraceful
attachment
to
a
beggarly
who
to
do
him
justice
has
not
sought
it
and
as
to
either
lord
if
he
were
at
home
or
my
aunt
not
allowing
me
to
quarrel
with
edmund
which
is
of
course
what
you
mean
any
body
else
mocking
her
voice
and
the
hesitation
of
her
manner
be
glad
to
know
how
prevent
it
i
may
be
called
to
account
afterwards
you
think
but
told
you
before
and
i
tell
you
again
that
if
i
am
provoked
no
consideration
for
consequences
shall
prevent
my
being
revenged
at
all
hazards
as
to
your
ever
marrying
me
or
not
you
may
please
yourself
but
i
shall
take
devilish
good
know
very
well
henry
she
interrupted
now
speaking
firmly
and
scornfully
in
spite
of
all
her
fears
never
will
marry
you
know
no
such
thing
he
rejoined
with
a
repetition
of
the
laugh
and
the
look
which
the
evening
before
had
made
her
shudder
and
which
now
again
caused
her
blood
to
run
cold
i
know
this
he
continued
you
shall
never
marry
edmund
and
further
that
i
will
not
be
openly
insulted
with
impunity
nor
will
i
suffer
such
a
fellow
forsooth
to
triumph
over
me
so
hate
me
in
your
heart
if
you
choose
but
at
your
peril
or
rather
at
his
peril
show
it
before
him
recollect
that
hanging
me
if
you
could
do
it
restore
him
to
life

i
have
blown
his

he
continued
insolently
opposing
the
attempt
she
was
now
making
to
escape
his

standing

her
and

i

when
she
brought
in

and
washed
him
that
she

of
than
that

i
can
tell
him
julia
could
listen
no
longer
she
passed
him
with
a
determined
effort
and
literally
fled
from
the
apartment
with
however
the
loss
of
a
scarf
which
henry
caught
at
as
she
was
departing
thus
concluded
poor
last
struggle
for
liberty
henceforward
she
never

who
was

of

were
engaged
at

one
with

after

julia
and
frances
now
entered
shortly
after
rising
and
going
towards
edmund
he
bent
over
the
table
and
said
in
an
under
tone
wish
you
would
just
tell
my
sister
it
will
save
me
a
letter
and
i
am
much
hurried
that
the
marquis
of
has
declared
his
intention
of
making
proposals
for
julia
in
due
time
and
that
i
think
she
had
better
write
to
lord
i
wish
he
could
be
at

yet
the
connexion
is
so
very
eligible
that
all
unnecessary
delays
should
be
avoided

that

added
in
a
sort
of
consulting

behaves
very
foolishly
but
i
should
hope
there
was
no
attachment
on
her
side
the

however

an
end
to
lord
arandale
returned
to
the
breakfast
table
and
left
our
hero
as
he
supposed
writing
julia
was
the
only
person
who
observed
that
he
remained
in
the
very
same
attitude
and
without
the
slightest
motion
till
the
carriages
drove
up
she
contrived
in
the
general
move
to
pass
near
the
table
at
which
he
sat
where
pausing
a
moment
she
said
you
writing
to
grandmamma
edmund
he
had
been
quite
pale
when
she
first
approached
and
evidently
had
not
observed
her
he
started
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
looked
at
her
without
appearing
to
comprehend
the
purport
of
her
enquiry
but
made
no
reply
you
writing
to
grandmamma
she
repeated
i
he
examined
his
paper
two
or
three
times
from
top
to
bottom
and
then
replied
henry
came
up
at
the
moment
and
offering
to
julia
his
arm
which
she
now
dare
not
refuse
hurried
her
to
the
carriage
she
perceived
with
much
vexation
that
he
wore
drawn
across
his
breast
the
scarf
he
had
snatched
from
her
he
continued
in
defiance
of
a
whispered
remonstrance
on
her
part
to
sport
it
for
some
hours
he
knew
that
edmund
was
well
aware
to
whom
the
scarf
belonged
at
length
lord
arandale
perceiving
what
was
going
on
insisted
on
the
scarf
being
resigned
the
earl
restored
it
himself
to
julia
with
a
reproachful
glance
to
which
she
replied
that
the
scarf
had
been
both
taken
and
worn
without
her
permission
seldom
take
liberties
they
do
not
expect
will
at
least
be
pardoned
replied
his
lordship
with
some
severity
of
countenance
why
henry
should
be
thus
anxious
to
have
it
supposed
that
he
was
acceptable
to
julia
while
he
took
so
little
pains
to
become
really
so
is
a
mystery
which
time
only
can
solve
our
hero
did
not
appear
on
the
stand
that
day
although
he
was
seen
riding
at
a
distance
on
the
course
at
the
ordinary
he
went
in
to
dinner
without
taking
charge
of
any
lady
at
the
ball
indeed
he
was
again
to
be
found
near
julia
after
a
few
languid
attempts
at
conversation
however
he
seated
himself
beside
her
in
perfect
silence
till
the
marquis
of
coming
towards
them
with
a
gay
and
delighted
air
claimed
her
hand
for
the
first
set
she
stood
up
to
dance
and
edmund
almost
immediately
left
the
room
when
edmund
retired
that
night
to
his
own
apartment
he
took
himself
severely
to
task
he
could
assuredly
acquit
himself
of
deliberate
efforts
intentions
or
even
wishes
to
gain
affections
beyond
the
limit
of
friendship
yet
he
had
in
every
moment
of
temptation
yielded
to
intoxicating
hopes
and
to
attempt
to
distinguish
between
such
hopes
and
wilful
wishes
he
found
was
mere
sophistry
he
determined
therefore
to
fly
without
again
beholding
julia
as
yet
her
innocent
heart
believed
all
its
feelings
friendship
she
would
think
him
unkind
ungrateful
and
forget
him
without
suffering
any
of
those
terrible
contentions
of
spirit
which
he
endured
he
dare
not
sleep
lest
he
should
awake
under
the
dominion
of
a
less
virtuous
impulse
without
therefore
retiring
to
bed
even
for
an
hour
he
commenced
instantly
and
hastily
his
preparations
for
departure
confusedly
ruminating
the
while
was
he
about
to
do
could
he
leave
julia
thus
to
the
persecutions
of
henry
to
the
persuasions
of
the
marquis
and
he
drew
his
leg
out
of
the
boot
into
which
it
had
been
half
way
he
was
confident
he
told
himself
once
more
for
the
hundredth
time
that
she
had
already
rejected
henry
and
that
she
would
reject
the
marquis
of
his
foot
again
entered
the
boot
top
and
now
completed
its
descent
chapter
xx
troubled
night
away
and
morning
returned
the
shaggy
mountains
their
grey
heads
the
blue
face
of
ocean
and
the
white
wave
was
seen
tumbling
round
the
distant
rock
i
climbed
the
narrow
path
and
stood
on
the
high
our
sacrifice
was
not
quite
so
great
as
he
imagined
the
ball
of
the
last
night
being
the
concluding
one
a
circumstance
he
had
not
considered
having
written
two
notes
of
farewell
one
to
lord
arandale
and
one
addressed
to
julia
and
frances
jointly
our
hero
left
ayr
just
before
daybreak
riding
and
without
a
servant
after
forming
we
suppose
very
proper
determinations
respecting
his
route
he
unfortunately
forgot
to
communicate
his
plans
to
his
horse
and
suffering
the
reins
to
lay
very
loosely
on
the
neck
himself
fell
into
a
deep
reverie
his
bucephalus
thus
left
to
his
own
devices
happened
to
perceive
a
gap
in
the
boundaries
of
the
high
road
which
particularly
caught
his
eye
as
it
not
a
little
resembled
the
approach
to
the
he
turned
in
accordingly
on
a
rugged
piece
of
moorland
and
looked
about
him
nor
right
nor
left
nor
straight
before
offered
other
prospect
than
a
wide
extent
of
close
cropped
sod
plentifully
sprinkled
with
loose
stones
and
diversified
here
and
there
by
pools
of
water
and
patches
of
heath
the
horizon
every
where
the
only
visible
boundary
while
on
the
extreme
edge
of
this
monotonous
waste
the
just
risen
sun
stood
in
lonely
majesty
uninteresting
as
all
this
may
appear
it
seemed
to
please
bucephalus
mightily
he
made
wide
his
nostrils
snuffed
the
morning
air
twice
swung
his
neck
to
try
the
length
of
his
rein
and
then
set
out
at
full
speed
the
road
or
rather
path
he
took
pursued
a
gradual
ascent
for
some
time
when
suddenly
the
spirited
animal
stopped
short
and
snorted
on
which
edmund
perceived
that
he
had
reached
the
brow
of
a
hill
or
rather
edge
of
a
precipice
whence
looking
down
an
abrupt
and
wooded
descent
a
valley
presented
itself
far
below
possessing
a
species
of
beauty
in
some
respects
peculiar
to
the
spot
a
small
river
or
rivulet
ran
close
beneath
the
overhanging
cliffs
which
formed
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
its
stream
varied
in
breadth
its
banks
were
rugged
and
irregular
while
its
course
frequently
divided
and
reunited
forming
many
of
the
most
picturesque
spots
into
little
islets
on
most
of
these
as
well
as
on
many
projecting
points
of
the
bank
stood
what
from
this
distance
at
least
had
the
appearance
of
ruined
towers
some
round
some
square
all
moss
grown
some
bearing
small
trees
on
their
summits
and
in
the
crevices
of
their
sides
and
almost
all
having
their
own
large
old
tree
or
trees
standing
close
to
them
the
grassy
carpet
of
the
vale
was
of
a
green
peculiarly
vivid
the
opposite
cliffs
were
thickly
wooded
in
every
aperture
while
here
and
there
smooth
brows
of
good
pasture
land
dotted
with
grazing
cattle
appeared
on
their
summits
the
valley
at
one
end
opened
on
an
extent
of
flat
country
terminated
by
a
distant
chain
of
mountains
at
the
other
it
admitted
a
view
of
the
sea
discernible
between
two
bold
headlands
the
furthest
and
highest
of
which
was
crowned
by
a
single
tower
that
appeared
destined
to
reign
over
all
those
more
humbly
situated
in
the
vale
beneath
tempted
by
the
beauty
of
the
prospect
though
not
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
country
to
know
where
he
now
was
edmund
directed
his
horse
to
take
a
rather
dangerous
looking
very
narrow
road
which
by
running
along
the
side
of
the
precipice
lessened
the
steepness
of
the
footing
while
it
promised
to
lead
him
into
the
midst
of
the
region
he
had
thus
been
for
some
moments
contemplating
as
he
gradually
drew
nearer
and
nearer
the
curious
scene
that
lay
beneath
him
and
at
length
accomplishing
his
perilous
descent
entered
the
valley
itself
and
approached
those
objects
which
he
had
at
first
thought
were
numerous
ruins
they
in
general
began
to
assume
somewhat
of
a
different
appearance
and
finally
on
coming
up
to
each
to
his
great
surprise
as
well
as
disappointment
they
one
by
one
proved
to
be
but
deep
sided
perpendicular
rocks
looking
however
as
ancient
as
though
they
had
in
the
time
of
noah
resisted
the
retiring
waters
of
the
flood
when
all
more
yielding
substances
had
been
borne
along
the
narrow
channel
of
the
glen
into
the
sea
he
now
crossed
the
river
by
means
of
a
single
arched
bridge
much
overhung
by
the
trees
of
the
opposite
bank
under
the
thick
cover
of
which
it
immediately
led
through
this
copse
he
rode
for
a
time
and
then
emerged
just
at
the
foot
of
the
headland
the
lofty
summit
of
which
bore
on
high
that
which
he
could
now
ascertain
to
be
the
only
real
tower
of
all
he
had
in
imagination
so
designated
rock
over
rock
with
wood
between
shelved
and
projected
till
how
the
building
itself
was
to
be
reached
seemed
an
impenetrable
mystery
there
did
not
appear
to
be
nearly
space
enough
to
conquer
so
perpendicular
an
ascent
by
any
windings
of
the
road
he
still
pursued
he
next
passed
a
which
was
opened
by
a
little
girl
who
stretched
first
the
one
side
on
its
hinges
then
the
other
though
our
hero
had
meanwhile
passed
through
at
a
second
gate
he
demanded
if
he
might
pursue
his
course
through
what
thus
seemed
to
be
an
approach
to
some
or
place
though
as
yet
he
could
discern
no
residence
he
was
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
proceeded
till
having
got
round
to
the
further
side
of
the
headland
a
part
of
the
height
of
which
he
had
meantime
by
a
gradual
ascent
achieved
he
came
suddenly
in
view
of
a
magnificent
castellated
mansion
apparently
surrounded
by
an
extensive
richly
wooded
and
beautifully
diversified
demesne
some
of
the
grounds
of
which
on
one
side
descended
by
an
inclined
plane
to
the
sea
and
the
whole
of
which
had
been
screened
from
view
during
the
former
part
of
his
ride
by
the
much
greater
height
of
the
side
nearest
the
valley
on
the
rocky
pinnacle
of
which
at
an
elevation
far
above
that
of
the
castle
and
surrounded
up
to
its
very
base
by
wood
still
appeared
conspicuous
the
same
single
tower
which
from
the
first
had
attracted
so
much
of
his
notice
seeing
a
lad
on
the
lawn
who
was
employed
rolling
the
newly
mown
grass
edmund
gave
him
his
horse
demanding
to
whom
the
place
belonged
and
if
the
family
were
at
home
the
lad
first
stared
awkwardly
and
when
about
to
reply
was
prevented
doing
so
coherently
by
the
unruly
movements
of
the
animal
committed
to
his
charge
our
hero
however
on
ascertaining
that
the
family
was
not
at
home
without
waiting
to
repeat
the
former
part
of
his
question
turned
into
a
footpath
among
the
trees
which
promised
to
lead
in
the
direction
of
the
said
solitary
tower
he
soon
found
himself
in
a
maze
of
gravel
walks
and
abrupt
turnings
the
ascent
so
steep
as
to
be
often
indispensably
assisted
by
flights
of
irregular
stone
steps
on
each
shelf
of
the
rock
lately
so
much
above
his
head
his
feet
now
found
a
path
though
one
secured
from
the
precipice
only
by
a
superabundant
growth
of
shrubs
on
the
side
of
the
cliff
immediately
over
the
sea
it
was
sometimes
quite
terrific
to
peep
through
the
slender
defences
of
a
honeysuckle
or
jessamine
at
the
foaming
billows
dashing
in
far
below
on
a
wild
and
rocky
beach
at
length
arrived
at
the
goal
of
all
his
labours
he
entered
the
long
seen
and
at
a
distance
tower
and
found
it
fitted
up
within
as
a
conservatory
and
well
supplied
with
exotics
in
full
bloom
of
these
he
plucked
mechanically
a
few
of
the
finest
blossoms
then
sighed
and
desisted
as
the
remembrance
smote
on
his
heart
that
he
could
not
now
as
he
had
been
wont
present
them
to
julia
he
thrust
however
those
he
had
collected
into
his
own
bosom
he
could
not
throw
away
what
had
once
been
even
in
thought
associated
with
her
near
this
building
the
last
of
the
shelving
paths
tapered
off
gradually
till
there
was
no
longer
footing
the
rock
rose
behind
it
more
than
overhung
while
in
front
there
was
now
no
defence
whatever
not
a
shrub
not
so
much
as
a
tuft
of
grass
or
even
moss
to
break
the
treacherous
surface
of
the
polished
flint
on
the
furthest
portion
which
it
was
possible
to
occupy
of
this
perilous
spot
was
placed
a
rustic
seat
on
this
edmund
flung
himself
and
rested
his
eyes
with
a
peculiarly
desolate
feeling
on
his
old
friends
and
companions
the
waves
of
the
sea
they
seemed
pressing
after
each
other
and
all
as
it
were
crowding
towards
the
foot
of
the
steep
cliff
from
the
summit
of
which
he
thus
viewed
them
he
smiled
bitterly
to
his
distempered
fancy
they
appeared
hastening
forward
to
welcome
his
return
amongst
them
with
a
fierce
and
boisterous
species
of
delight
very
uncongenial
to
the
softer
emotions
in
which
he
had
of
late
so
much
too
frequently
indulged
he
ejaculated
bosom
of
the
deep
is
indeed
my
only
home
the
wide
waste
of
waters
my
comfortless
domain
to
spread
desolation
around
me
with
fire
and
with
sword
to
bring
death
and
misery
in
my
train
to
send
destruction
and
despair
in
the
whirlwind
before
me
these
are
my
daily
duties
these
my
domestic
joys
he
paused
then
proceeded
once
there
of
the
has
torn
them
from
me
nay
must
tear
myself
from
them
i
must
seem
ungrateful
must
teach
those
who
might
have
forget
a
villain
he
hastened
to
add
for
certain
words
in
the
last
sentence
were
shaking
his
best
resolutions
a
villain
he
repeated
he
less
who
wrapped
in
mystery
without
a
name
without
a
home
without
a
country
would
ensnare
the
innocent
affections
of
one
unknowing
of
the
world
unable
as
yet
to
judge
what
may
one
day
be
her
own
appreciation
of
its
honours
or
even
of
its
prejudices
after
a
pause
he
pronounced
firmly
must
never
see
her
more
he
now
sunk
back
in
perfect
supineness
all
the
purposes
of
existence
seemed
at
an
end
for
him
by
his
own
free
will
act
he
had
quitted
love
and
happiness
for
ever
he
felt
every
power
of
resistance
weakened
by
the
supernatural
effort
the
image
of
julia
hallowed
endeared
like
that
of
a
departed
friend
presented
itself
in
a
new
and
if
possible
tenderer
light
were
he
now
he
thought
to
behold
that
smile
again
where
would
be
the
restraints
of
duty
forgotten
utterly
forgotten
in
the
tumultuous
joy
of
such
a
moment
and
had
such
felicity
been
his
but
yesterday
heavens
yesterday
now
fatigued
by
contending
thoughts
he
now
strove
not
to
think
at
all
at
length
as
he
lay
in
the
reclining
position
induced
by
the
languor
of
despondency
the
dashing
of
the
waves
began
to
sound
more
distant
than
before
and
a
slender
creeping
plant
which
hung
from
the
rock
immediately
above
his
head
was
during
momentary
and
flitting
visions
mistaken
for
some
part
of
the
rigging
of
a
ship
and
then
seen
no
more
in
fact
not
having
been
in
bed
the
night
before
and
having
ever
since
suffered
great
agony
of
mind
he
was
now
so
completely
exhausted
that
a
sort
of
torpor
was
gradually
taking
possession
of
his
senses
this
after
some
time
deepened
into
a
sound
and
refreshing
sleep
which
lasted
for
several
hours
towards
the
end
of
his
protracted
slumber
our
hero
began
to
dream
that
he
was
in
heaven
yet
sublimely
as
he
had
sometimes
conceived
of
the
glories
of
that
abode
of
the
blessed
he
could
see
nothing
but
clear
sky
every
where
not
even
the
angels
though
he
heard
them
singing
one
of
songs
too
and
precisely
with
her
voice
the
voice
ceased
and
then
the
general
music
of
the
spheres
seemed
to
arise
all
round
him
by
degrees
he
became
sensible
that
the
music
was
real
and
that
his
eyes
which
had
been
for
some
seconds
partly
open
were
gazing
upwards
at
the
bright
blue
sky
which
from
the
circumstance
of
his
lying
on
his
back
was
necessarily
unvaried
by
any
other
object
he
started
to
his
feet
a
little
too
suddenly
considering
the
dangerous
position
he
occupied
and
of
the
particular
nature
of
which
he
had
at
the
moment
no
precise
recollection
fortunately
however
being
uncommonly
active
by
a
powerful
effort
and
a
snatch
at
the
creeping
plant
before
mentioned
he
was
enabled
to
recover
his
balance
he
observed
where
he
was
called
to
mind
the
wanderings
which
had
brought
him
there
and
acknowledged
to
himself
that
he
must
have
slept
so
far
mysteries
were
cleared
up
but
the
music
he
still
heard
and
now
he
assuredly
was
awake
he
walked
a
little
way
in
various
directions
in
the
hope
of
discovering
the
musicians
but
from
the
effect
produced
by
the
circular
form
of
the
rock
the
occasional
waftings
of
the
breeze
and
the
mazy
labyrinth
of
the
paths
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
decide
whether
he
approached
or
retreated
from
the
sounds
after
descending
however
till
he
was
two
or
three
shelves
lower
it
became
evident
that
the
swell
of
wind
instruments
was
fuller
though
still
he
could
not
tell
in
what
direction
it
came
while
listening
to
discover
this
his
ear
caught
the
hum
of
voices
he
moved
on
it
became
more
distinct
and
through
it
he
could
even
distinguish
the
very
uncelestial
sound
of
knives
and
forks
clanking
on
plates
edmund
notwithstanding
felt
something
like
a
responding
inward
emotion
for
he
had
not
yet
breakfasted
and
it
was
now
two
he
still
moved
on
and
now
the
noise
of
the
voices
seemed
to
arise
actually
from
below
the
spot
on
which
he
stood
he
performed
a
species
of
pirouette
looking
the
very
personification
of
bewilderment
then
stood
some
seconds
motionless
then
as
though
smitten
by
a
sudden
inspiration
pushed
his
head
and
one
shoulder
through
the
tangled
clusters
of
an
interposing
honeysuckle
and
holding
firmly
with
the
contrary
arm
around
the
slender
and
yielding
trunk
of
a
young
mountain
ash
about
which
the
flowery
screen
had
entwined
itself
he
leaned
forward
and
beheld
on
a
broad
part
of
the
shelf
or
terrace
of
rock
next
below
the
one
on
which
he
himself
stood
a
long
luncheon
table
with
a
large
company
seated
at
it
crowns
of
hats
cauls
of
bonnets
and
figures
foreshortened
to
excess
afforded
no
very
sure
criterion
by
which
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
any
of
the
party
were
known
to
him
the
voices
too
were
so
blended
with
each
other
and
with
the
music
and
with
the
aforesaid
clanking
that
they
brought
no
certainty
of
any
thing
yet
as
he
looked
and
listened
he
could
not
divest
himself
of
the
idea
that
all
was
familiar
to
his
eye
and
to
his
ear
while
impelled
by
increasing
curiosity
he
strained
forward
in
rather
an
imprudent
manner
one
of
the
blossoms
which
he
had
collected
in
the
conservatory
and
placed
loosely
within
the
breast
of
his
coat
now
assisted
by
his
bending
attitude
found
its
way
out
and
descending
lightly
as
a
rested
on
the
bosom
of
a
lady
who
immediately
lifted
up
her
face
to
see
whence
it
came
what
was
astonishment
when
he
saw
the
features
of
julia
and
what
was
hers
when
she
so
unexpectedly
beheld
edmund
in
his
most
strange
and
perilous
situation
hanging
over
her
very
head
she
pronounced
his
name
and
continued
looking
up
with
as
much
terror
as
surprise
till
the
whole
company
following
the
direction
of
her
eyes
with
one
accord
gazed
upwards
a
general
roar
of
laughter
proceeded
from
the
men
and
several
pretty
little
screams
from
the
ladies
it
edmund
cried
henry
involuntarily
exclaimed
julia
wonder
if
he
could
said
frances
looking
half
amused
and
half
alarmed
funny
it
would
be
cried
the
misses
morven
the
path
to
the
right
montgomery
and
come
down
to
us
said
lord
arandale
edmund
disappeared
from
above
and
in
a
few
minutes
joined
the
party
below
he
made
his
way
immediately
to
julia
and
frances
who
each
extended
a
hand
to
him
at
the
same
time
making
room
for
him
between
them
is
unexpected
happiness
indeed
he
said
as
he
sprang
into
the
offered
seat
he
looked
delighted
he
even
laughed
though
hysterically
as
he
trembled
from
head
to
foot
with
uncontrollable
emotion
know
where
you
are
i
suppose
montgomery
said
the
earl
i
answered
edmund
than
that
my
present
situation
is
a
very
enviable
one
this
he
said
with
an
air
of
light
gallantry
which
concealed
tolerably
well
both
the
reality
and
the
extravagance
of
his
feelings
do
not
know
then
that
this
place
is
the
craigs
rejoined
the
earl
are
all
here
to
day
for
the
express
purpose
of
displaying
its
beauties
to
julia
and
frances
who
have
never
had
an
opportunity
of
visiting
it
before
we
are
to
attempt
the
top
of
the
rock
as
soon
as
we
have
fortified
ourselves
by
have
seen
many
of
its
beauties
he
replied
without
knowing
where
i
was
my
horse
in
fact
brought
me
here
this
morning
while
i
was
thinking
of
something
then
too
much
confounded
to
talk
any
thing
but
nonsense
and
too
much
exhilarated
to
be
silent
he
addressed
julia
enquiring
if
she
were
aware
that
the
building
on
the
top
of
the
rock
was
a
conservatory
she
replied
in
the
negative
me
then
he
rejoined
with
seeming
playfulness
but
breathless
from
agitation
me
to
be
the
first
to
present
you
with
an
offering
of
its
sweets
as
he
spoke
he
took
the
remainder
of
the
flowers
from
his
bosom
and
gave
them
to
julia
experiencing
at
the
moment
an
indescribable
delight
in
reversing
as
it
were
the
feeling
with
which
he
had
placed
them
there
this
was
mere
trifling
but
such
was
the
effect
on
spirits
of
all
this
happiness
restored
and
without
any
fault
of
his
too
just
at
the
very
moment
when
he
had
resigned
it
all
that
under
the
intoxicating
sense
of
the
present
pleasure
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
said
or
did
or
how
sufficiently
to
enjoy
so
much
felicity
while
it
lasted
for
through
it
all
there
was
a
vaguely
recognised
idea
that
it
must
pass
away
julia
took
the
flowers
with
a
smile
not
at
all
calculated
to
sober
transports
and
placed
them
of
course
without
thinking
what
she
was
doing
in
so
enviable
a
situation
that
they
were
followed
by
the
eyes
of
our
hero
and
gazed
upon
as
their
delicate
blossoms
visibly
vibrated
to
each
pulsation
of
heart
till
he
wished
himself
not
glove
upon
that
hand
but
a
fair
blossom
are
very
much
obliged
to
your
horse
captain
montgomery
said
lady
arandale
it
is
to
him
it
seems
we
owe
the
pleasure
of
your
company
and
now
we
shall
certainly
not
allow
you
to
escape
again
till
after
our
edmund
bowed
assent
several
of
the
party
asked
him
if
in
his
wanderings
he
had
discovered
the
bower
of
the
concealed
musicians
he
described
how
much
they
had
puzzled
his
researches
julia
told
him
and
her
voice
which
so
lately
he
had
scarcely
hoped
to
hear
again
thrilled
through
his
heart
as
she
spoke
the
unimportant
words
that
this
had
all
been
contrived
by
lord
arandale
as
an
agreeable
surprise
that
his
lordship
had
privately
sent
on
musicians
directions
to
the
housekeeper
and
then
when
they
were
all
on
the
way
between
and
arandale
he
had
very
innocently
proposed
that
they
should
look
at
the
craigs
as
it
lay
but
a
couple
of
miles
from
the
direct
road
dare
say
said
frances
edmund
was
in
the
secret
and
that
he
just
came
on
before
to
be
a
part
of
the
julia
looked
at
him
to
see
if
this
were
true
but
the
question
her
eyes
had
intended
to
ask
was
forgotten
something
in
the
expression
of
his
producing
a
sad
confusion
of
ideas
just
at
the
moment
am
sure
he
surprised
me
in
a
most
especial
manner
drawled
out
lady
morven
quite
astounded
me
said
graham
in
exactly
the
same
tone
i
was
not
the
fortunate
tenant
of
a
repose
chair
i
had
a
narrow
escape
of
falling
through
this
jessamine
and
going
over
the
immeasurable
cliff
talk
so
you
creature
said
lady
morven
was
more
surprised
than
any
one
else
i
am
sure
said
miss
morven
i
had
not
caught
hold
of
this
rose
bush
and
pricked
all
my
fingers
i
should
certainly
have
gone
over
i
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
that
has
scratched
all
the
back
of
my
neck
i
only
for
this
honeysuckle
though
one
branch
broke
off
and
frightened
me
so
i
sure
if
gordon
had
not
just
put
out
his
arm
and
saved
me
thus
had
all
the
misses
morven
escaped
ladies
mean
that
captain
montgomery
is
the
most
agreeable
part
of
the
surprise
said
the
earl
good
humouredly
the
misses
morven
tittered
assent
frances
questioned
him
as
to
how
his
joining
them
had
really
happened
he
gave
as
circumstantial
an
account
of
his
morning
adventure
as
the
flutter
of
his
spirits
would
permit
when
he
described
the
situation
of
his
late
and
how
he
had
started
to
his
feet
without
remembering
where
he
was
lady
arandale
seriously
reprimanded
him
for
his
thoughtlessness
all
the
misses
morven
were
clamorous
lady
morven
said
he
might
really
have
fallen
on
the
centre
of
the
luncheon
table
and
frightened
them
all
to
death
frances
scolded
him
with
tears
in
her
eyes
julia
alone
did
not
speak
but
she
looked
round
became
pale
and
the
next
moment
red
the
blood
rushed
from
and
to
the
heart
of
edmund
with
a
corresponding
ebb
and
flow
after
a
pause
as
though
to
change
the
too
engrossing
subject
thus
implied
by
the
silence
of
both
he
asked
her
abruptly
if
she
had
sung
since
she
had
been
at
the
craigs
one
song
had
been
attempted
at
lady
particular
request
to
try
the
effect
of
an
echo
luncheon
ended
the
whole
party
proceeded
towards
the
handsome
castellated
mansion
already
mentioned
to
view
the
fine
collection
of
pictures
it
contained
chapter
xxi
around
and
all
was
we
left
our
party
crossing
the
now
well
rolled
lawn
towards
the
house
on
their
arrival
at
the
great
door
which
was
open
a
strange
scene
presented
itself
in
the
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
a
short
fat
gentleman
looking
with
much
astonishment
at
a
little
thin
old
woman
who
from
her
long
tapering
stomachered
waist
occupying
one
half
of
her
height
her
full
petticoats
spreading
like
a
hoop
her
short
sleeves
and
mittens
her
hair
white
as
though
it
were
powdered
drawn
up
over
a
high
shaped
cushion
and
her
small
cap
on
the
top
of
much
one
of
the
figures
in
the
frontispiece
of
an
old
play
book
her
diminutive
features
had
nothing
remarkable
about
them
but
the
little
reddish
knob
or
button
at
the
end
of
her
nose
which
seemed
placed
there
expressly
to
support
her
spectacles
these
in
visible
hurry
and
trepidation
she
was
adjusting
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
she
was
grasping
the
fat
arm
and
at
the
same
time
exclaiming
as
with
looks
of
terrified
amazement
she
scanned
his
appearance
dinna
pretend
to
tell
me
sir
that
ye
are
maister
lauson
the
fat
gentleman
affirmed
that
he
certainly
was
lauson
the
little
woman
seemed
of
opinion
that
she
knew
better
and
maintained
that
he
was
not
the
advance
of
the
entering
party
and
the
earl
addressing
the
fat
gentleman
by
the
name
of
lauson
seemed
to
complete
the
dismay
of
poor
the
housekeeper
for
such
was
the
name
and
such
the
quality
of
the
little
woman
lauson
lauson
she
reiterated
clasping
her
hands
iver
heerd
sick
a
thing
she
cried
next
jean

some
on
ye

maister
a
taw

lookt
gentleman
the
least
like

said
lauson
very
sulkily
for
the
messrs
morven
had
laughed
out
and
the
misses
morven
were
tittering
evidently
at
his
expense
lord
arandale
desired
there
might
be
no
more
noise
assuring
that
the
gentleman
whose
identity
she
seemed
so
unwilling
to
admit
not
only
was
beyond
a
doubt
lauson
but
that
he
was
at
the
craigs
that
day
by
his
the
particular
desire
to
give
him
the
meeting
for
the
arrangement
of
some
business
respecting
serious
repairs
which
he
understood
the
park
walls
required
madam
said
lauson

not
dispute
that
but

mean
said
the
earl
did
ye
send
naybody
then
eagerly
demanded
the
poor
woman
on
being
fully
assured
that
no
person
whatever
had
been
sent
to
the
craigs
or
authorized
in
any
way
to
demand
of
her
any
thing
of
which
she
had
the
charge

cried
first
clasping
her
hands
for
a
moment
then

her
arms
to
their
utmost
extent
asunder

naything

and
calling
on

and
jean
to
witness
the
truth
of
all
she
should
say
after
much
that
was
too
incoherent
to
relate
gave
the
following
account
though
more
frequently
interrupted
by
her
hearers

is
necessary
to
notice

i

to

noisy
my
good
woman
said
the
earl
but
mildly
for
he
made
charitable
allowance
for
the
excited
state
of
her
feelings
pray
when
did
all
this
happen
he
continued
a
month
syne
she
replied
the
receipts
will
receipts
asked
lauson
i
tell
ye
at
he
geed
me
receipts
for

she
replied
with
much
asperity
at
the
same
time
beginning
to
rummage
her
pockets
be
sure
i
hey
them
she
murmured
and
the
longer
she
was
in
finding
them
among
the
varied
treasures
she
successively
drew
forth
and
in
her
agitation
alternately
took
from
one
pocket
and
put
into
the
other
the
more
frequently
she
repeated
be
sure
i
hey
them
at
length
with
trembling
hands
after
frequent
wiping
of
her
spectacles
which
her
fast
falling
tears
as
often
dimmed
she
selected
from
the
chaos
a
tied
up
parcel
containing
receipts
for
every
thing
all
signed
with
the
name
of
lauson
and
in
a
hand
which
was
a
very
tolerable
imitation
of
his
lauson
exclaimed
against
the
daring
act
of
forging
his
name
swearing
that
whoever
had
done
so
should
swing
for
it
as
for
your
long
story
madam
he
continued
turning
to
shall
quickly
prove
it
all
a
pack
of
lies
here
are
the
keys
labels
and
all
in
my
own
and
thence
he
accordingly
produced
them
a
likely
story
he
continued
a
had
been
able
to
get
possession
of
them
out
of
japan
cabinet
at
lodore
house
that
he
would
have
run
the
risk
of
putting
them
there
again
after
they
had
served
his
turn
and
from
thence
i
took
them
with
my
own
hands
only
three
days
exclamations
of
wonder
here
followed
the
earl
cast
a
very
angry
glance
at
poor
she
was
thunderstruck
she
could
not
deny
that
those
were
indeed
the
keys
yet
protested
that
her
former
statement
was
notwithstanding
gospel
truth
affected
by
her
tears
and
protestations
julia
declared
her
belief
of
poor
innocence
however
inexplicable
the
circumstances
might
said
the
earl
at
length
you
who
are
most
interested
wish
it
we
shall
at
least
consider
her
innocent
till
she
is
proved
wept
like
a
child
fell
at
feet
and
begged
she
would
and
abuse
her
aw
at
iver
she
could
and
no
break
her
heart
by
sick
goodness
when
the
surprise
had
at
length
a
little
subsided
many
spacious
apartments
were
visited
and
the
picture
gallery
in
particular
which
bearing
on
its
now
naked
walls
the
numerous
traces
of
departed
frames
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
gave
thus
a
silent
and
melancholy
testimony
of
how
great
a
loss
had
been
sustained
edmund
reminded
lord
arandale
that
a
clue
might
be
found
to
some
useful
discoveries
in
what
gotterimo
had
said
of
the
london
swindler
having
sold
to
a
friend
of
his
plate
pictures
coins
his
lordship
requested
the
gentlemen
to
be
present
while
he
examined
the
rest
of
the
servants
the
ladies
walked
on
towards
the
chapter
xxii
who
can
speak
what
all
can
feel
julia
and
frances
during
the
straying
and
waiting
which
ensued
happened
to
wander
into
a
path
which
separated
them
from
the
rest
of
the
young
people
you
know
julia
said
frances
i
have
become
of
late
a
great
judge
of
love
pray
how
has
that
happened
asked
julia
trying
to
laugh
it
is
in
consequence
of
all
those
new
lovers
that
you
and
i
have
had
of
late
i
now
understand
the
business
perfectly
i
know
their
ways
of
looking
and
their
ways
of
sighing
and
their
ways
of
lowering
the
is
no
describing
it
you
know
but
in
short
i
now
understand
it
will
at
this
rate
become
quite
a
dangerous
member
of
society
rejoined
julia
with
another
effort
to
laugh
a
novice
i
must
have
been
but
a
few
days
since
continued
frances
have
been
so
taken
in
as
i
was
by
that
business
between
edmund
and
lady
susan
why
he
no
more
loves
her
nor
ever
did
than
i
do
that
stick
sir
philip
she
loves
him
indeed
i
have
no
heart
beat
so
fast
that
she
made
several
attempts
before
she
could
articulate
the
following
words
why
did
he
wish
her
ladyship
to
marry
him
is
what
puzzles
me
replied
frances
think
there
must
have
been
something
strange
in
the
business
lady
susan
did
say
a
good
deal
about
his
being
so
modest
in
consequence
of
his
want
of
rank
that
she
feared
she
had
been
obliged
to
meet
him
more
than
half
why
meet
her
any
part
of
the
way
if
he
did
not
wish
it
said
julia
might
you
know
have
been
dazzled
by
the
great
advantages
of
such
a
marriage
replied
frances
been
induced
by
her
evident
preference
to
mistake
his
own
feelings
but
however
that
may
have
been
of
two
things
i
am
now
certain
the
one
that
he
does
not
love
lady
susan
the
other
that
he
does
love
she
paused
but
julia
made
no
reply
julia
frances
continued
am
convinced
that
he
loves
you
in
the
most
extravagant
the
most
passionate
the
most
enthusiastic
manner
oh
it
is
so
plain
to
be
seen
in
every
thing
julia
was
still
silent
but
she
pressed
her
hand
involuntarily
as
if
thanking
her
for
the
joyful
emotions
her
words
were
exciting
short
continued
frances
loves
you
with
my
love
and
the
put
together
if
you
can
imagine
what
sort
of
a
love
that
would
make
and
i
am
sure
he
is
breaking
his
heart
because
he
knows
papa
will
never
consent
to
your
marrying
him
i
wish
she
added
did
love
lady
you
julia
julia
made
no
immediate
reply
say
julia
repeated
frances
you
wish
it
was
lady
susan
that
edmund
loved
you
think
it
would
be
very
unamiable
of
him
to
love
a
stranger
better
than
those
he
has
always
loved
ever
since
they
were
children
i
know
said
frances
i
am
sure
that
loving
you
will
make
him
very
unhappy
you
know
because
papa
will
never
allow
you
to
marry
we
always
have
a
great
regard
for
each
other
marrying
asked
julia
a
regard
yes
said
frances
i
think
that
poor
edmund
would
be
much
happier
if
he
loved
lady
susan
and
were
married
to
her
than
he
will
be
loving
you
and
going
to
sea
and
you
marrying
the
marquis
or
some
such
i
will
never
do
said
julia
with
sudden
energy
at
this
moment
edmund
appeared
coming
towards
them
julia
hastily
put
up
her
parasol
though
the
walk
was
perfectly
shady
the
parasol
entangled
in
every
branch
and
she
as
hastily
took
it
down
again
edmund
now
joined
them
and
offered
an
arm
to
each
colonel
morven
however
whom
they
soon
encountered
interrupted
this
arrangement
declaring
that
the
walks
were
too
narrow
for
three
and
requesting
frances
to
take
his
arm
thus
they
proceeded
with
the
rest
of
the
party
towards
the
rock
conservatory
julia
was
unusually
silent
but
there
was
something
in
her
manner
more
dangerous
if
possible
than
ever
to
right
resolves
so
true
is
it
that
nothing
can
pass
in
the
minds
of
those
we
love
without
our
knowing
at
least
that
there
is
something
passing
and
of
what
nature
that
something
was
seemed
in
the
present
instance
to
be
recognised
for
he
too
became
silent
yet
during
that
silence
both
felt
a
conviction
of
each
affection
stronger
perhaps
than
any
they
had
before
known
how
often
how
very
often
when
distance
both
of
time
and
place
intervened
was
the
impression
received
during
that
to
both
for
ever
memorable
day
remembered
and
attempted
to
be
renewed
severally
by
both
how
often
inwardly
appealed
to
how
often
called
upon
to
contradict
proofs
to
bear
down
facts
but
the
misery
of
this
species
of
evidence
is
that
though
at
the
moment
the
most
entirely
convincing
it
fades
in
absence
to
a
mere
dream
of
the
imagination
and
while
with
strange
inconsistency
we
find
the
greatest
aggravation
of
our
suffering
in
the
fear
that
we
never
did
possess
that
of
which
we
are
thus
lamenting
the
loss
we
still
do
lament
and
with
the
bitter
feelings
of
those
entitled
to
complain
that
they
have
been
bereft
of
all
a
pretty
general
meeting
of
stray
couples
now
took
place
in
the
conservatory
and
many
were
the
observations
made
on
our
perilous
after
viewing
various
other
beauties
of
the
place
our
party
at
length
agreed
that
it
was
time
to
proceed
to
arandale
which
they
reached
without
further
adventure
their
arrival
was
soon
followed
by
that
of
the
marquis
of
and
such
other
guests
as
were
not
of
the
immediate
family
circle

the
the
gala
of
the
evening
was
to
commence
as
soon
as
dusk
with
illuminations
fireworks
and
various
entertainments
out
of

and
to
conclude
with
a
masked
ball
and
unmasked
supper
within
the

far
as

could
reach
on

walks

and
to

were
festooned
with
coloured
lamps
and
at
an
early
hour
filled
with
groups
of
company
lady
cottage
itself
was
illuminated
in
a
simple
style
while
to
the
great
delight
of
the
peasantry
and
tenantry
who
were
permitted
to
peep
in
at
the
window
her
ladyship
dressed
in
a
rustic
garb
of
stuff
with
ribbon
tucks
sat
by
a
bright
fire
spinning
with
great
industry
the
trees
were
purposely
left
without
lamps
to
a
certain
distance
round
and
at
the
back
of
the
little
thatched
building
which
with
its
one
window
lit
up
as
if
to
contribute
its
humble
mite
to
the
great
public
rejoicings
and
its
open
door
emitting
a
stream
of
firelight
had
a
singularly
picturesque
appearance
julia

and

barton
jones
moved
with
a
crowd
of
others
towards
the
lake
where
wonders
awaited
the
curious
spectator
the
trees
which
surrounded
and
even
dipped
their
branches
into
this
fine
sheet
of
water
were
thickly
and
beautifully
hung
with
coloured
lamps
which
reflected
in
seemingly
unfathomable
depths
shone
like
the
stars
of
an
inverted
sky
the
long
light
iron
bridge
which
crossed
a
narrow
arm
of
the
lake
was
also
illuminated
with
much
taste
and
variety
on
this
our
party
with
a
number
of
the
select
company
took
up
their
position
the
situation
being
elevated
and
commanding
therefore
a
good
view
of
all
that
was
to
be
seen
the
earl
had
contrived
a
more
animated
representation
of
the
engagement
of
which
this
fête
was
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
than
could
have
been
produced
by
the
hackneyed
mode
of
transparencies
he
had
had
a
number
of
pleasure
boats
fitted
up
and
rigged
exactly
as
men
of
war
with
their
sides
artificially
raised
to
admit
of
their
seeming
to
have
one
two
or
three
tier
of
guns
according
to
their
ratings
of
these
two
hostile
fleets
now
appeared
on
the
lake
manœuvring
not
far
from
each
other
the
admirals
on
both
sides
exhibiting
their
three
stern
lights
signalizing
their
respective
squadrons
and
from
time
to
time
turning
their
broadsides
in
full
view
lowering
their
mimic
ports
which
were
lighted
up
within
and
making
thus
an
ostentatious
display
of
their
triple
row
of
guns
edmund
absolutely
laughed
like
a
child
at
the
pompous
airs
they
assumed
so
well
capital
he
exclaimed
arthur
who
stood
near
him
was
delighted
many
were
the
questions
put
by
the
ladies
to
captain
montgomery
he
explained
every
movement
as
well
as
he
could
for
laughing
but
to
him
who
was
accustomed
to
wield
the
fearful
engines
of
real
destructive
warfare
thus
imitated
the
proud
airs
of
those
little
vessels
were
irresistibly
amusing
while
to
julia
and
all
such
as
had
never
seen
any
thing
greater
the
representation
was
growing
quite
imposing
indeed
the
longer
it
was
gazed
upon
the
better
became
the
deception
for
the
imagination
and
the
eye
both
began
to
allow
distance
for
the
deficiency
in
size
and
as
the
engagement
seemed
about
to
commence
the
whole
moving
scene
assumed
much
of
reality
and
consequence
henry
too
as
a
naval
character
had
become
the
oracle
of
another
circle
of
ladies
at
a
little
distance
for
on
the
present
occasion
he
did
not
feel
much
inclined
to
place
himself
in
immediate
comparison
with
our
hero
now
a
few
were
fired
this
was
followed
by
a
pause
almost
awful
when
a
brisk
cannonade
commenced
along
the
line
of
battle
on
both
sides
one
english
frigate
in
particular
made
herself
very
conspicuous
but
power
of
giving
information
seemed
suddenly
quite
exhausted
or
he
was
so
much
engaged
pointing
out
admiral
lord
vessel
and
explaining
his
signals
and
what
had
been
from
the
first
his
intentions
that
he
was
quite
deaf
to
all
questions
respecting
the
frigate
what
would
have
become
of
the
unsatisfied
and
increasing
curiosity
of
the
ladies
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
say
had
not
an
elderly
gentleman
in
naval
uniform
informed
them
that
the
remarkably
situated
vessel
which
had
drawn
so
much
of
their
attention
and
which
might
well
be
termed
the
heroine
of
the
day
was
the
euphrasia
commanded
by
captain
montgomery
he
then
proceeded
to
eulogize
the
gallantry
general
character
and
even
the
private
virtues
of
the
said
captain
sir
he
added
addressing
edmund
seem
so
well
acquainted
with
lord
and
his
plans
you
must
have
met
with
captain
montgomery
i
should
think
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
service
whom
values
more
or
rather
perhaps
i
should
say
so
edmund
no
longer
able
to
feign
attention
to
other
subjects
bowed
and
smiled
at
the
same
time
casting
an
appealing
look
around
him
as
much
as
to
say
no
one
release
me
out
of
this
dilemma
the
stranger
stared
the
marquis
good
naturedly
interposed
and
said
believe
sir
you
have
been
all
this
time
putting
captain
montgomery
very
much
to
the
i
then
the
honour
of
addressing
captain
montgomery
said
our
naval
friend
first
bowing
then
adding
me
sir
he
shook
edmund
most
cordially
by
the
hand
enthusiastic
heart
glowed
while
it
palpitated
how
insignificant
now
appeared
inherited
titles
when
compared
with
the
exalted
name
edmund
had
obtained
for
himself
how
dimly
now
shone
mere
reflected
hereditary
splendour
unsustained
by
great
actions
on
the
part
of
the
individual
himself
when
compared
with
the
inherent
glory
of
the
founder
of
nobility
she
could
not
love
edmund
better
but
henceforward
instead
of
being
afraid
and
ashamed
of
her
feelings
she
would
be
proud
of
her
preference
for
such
a
character
she
was
sure
she
should
now
have
courage
to
own
it
to
her
father
then
a
sudden
thought
of
the
dangers
attendant
on
so
brilliant
a
career
dangers
which
at
the
moment
seemed
passing
in
review
before
her
eyes
dangers
which
might
on
any
day
or
hour
again
recur
struck
a
panic
to
her
heart
and
occasioned
an
involuntary
movement
which
had
she
not
checked
it
instantly
would
have
been
a
gentle
pressure
of
the
arm
on
which
she
his
breathing
for
some
then
relinquished
with
a
blush
at
his
own
folly
a
presumptuous
surmise
which
had
crossed
his
mind
but
he
drew
the
arm
that
leaned
on
his
closer
to
his
side
though
so
gradually
that
there
seemed
no
impertinence
scarcely
intention
in
the
act
or
rather
it
might
be
supposed
to
have
been
induced
by
the
necessity
of
taking
some
such
precaution
against
the
perpetually
passing
and
crowd
the
fire
of
the
mimic
fleets
was
now
slackening
the
smoke
clearing
away
and
the
french
vessels
lowering
their
colours
amid
the
shouts
of
the
delighted
multitude
some
of
the
disabled
ships
of
the
enemy
were
now
seen
to
drift
to
a
certain
distance
from
the
rest
of
the
fleet
where
instead
of
burning
or
blowing
up
in
the
common
mode
they
immediately
became
the
sources
whence
issued
fireworks
curious
various
and
brilliant
in
the
extreme
during
this
beautiful
exhibition
britannia
was
played
in
magnificent
style
on
board
the
english
fleet
the
earl
having
placed
for
that
purpose
one
of
his
favourite
musicians
in
each
mimic
vessel
so
that
the
little
fleet
might
thus
form
a
complete
band
when
the
harmonies
on
the
water
died
away
they
were
answered
by
save
the
king
from
another
band
of
equally
excellent
performers
who
were
concealed
among
the
woods
at
the
distance
best
calculated
for
effect
at
these
sounds
such
of
the
company
as
were
of
a
rank
to
be
indoor
guests
returned
to
the
castle
while
the
remaining
crowd
were
entertained
in
lit
up
tents
in
which
confidential
servants
presided
some
personating
prize
agents
and
distributing
not
only
refreshments
to
the
people
but
the
bounty
under
the
name
of
prize
money
this
latter
immunity
however
was
extended
only
to
such
as
had
wit
enough
to
humour
the
sports
of
the
evening
by
assuming
the
characters
of
sailors
or
wives
for
it
was
lord
object
to
add
as
much
as
was
in
his
power
to
the
well
merited
popularity
of
a
service
so
vitally
essential
to
the
glory

amid
the

some
among
the
foliage
of
the
all
now
assumed
their
fancy
dresses
julia
frances
and
the
four
misses
morven
were
by
lord
wish
habited
as
the
principal
covering
consisted
of
a
long
clinging
robe
of
a
bright
green
around
the
bust
was
wrapped
white
gauze
of
the
slightest
texture
its
folds
so
arranged
as
to
resemble
as
much
as
possible
the
crested
foam
of
ocean
from
which
the
head
neck
and
arms
seemed
as
it
were
emerging
while
a
part
of
the
same
drapery
fell
over
one
shoulder
and
floated
loosely
behind
the
figure
like
the
line
of
light
on
divided
waters
through
various
parts
of
the
dress
was
twisted
bright
scarlet
coral
intermingled
with
tufts
of
bound
together
by
clusters
of
the
most
brilliant
emeralds
seemingly
unset
and
mixed
with
small
shells
to
give
their
grouping
a
natural
appearance
while
over
all
were
scattered
costly
pearls
innumerable
neither
strung
nor
set
the
feet
and
ankles
in
particular
were
entirely
encrusted
with
ornaments
of
this
mixed
description
as
if
the
accumulation
had
been
collected
by
treading
the
rocks
and
caverns
of
the
fathomless
deep
among
hidden
treasures
the
very
long
fair
hair
of
the
sisters
worn
quite
loose
was
peculiarly
becoming
to
this
costume
it
hung
around
in
a
shower
of
brightness
as
though
sunbeams
were
gilding
the
light
spray
with
which
sportive
movements
through
the
watery
element
thus
partially
covered
as
with
a
sparkling
yet
transparent
veil

lovely
vision
this
group
did
not
wear
masks
as
they
were
to
assist
in
receiving
the
company
a
small
the
first
of
the
suite
thrown
open
on
the
present
occasion
was
fitted
up
to
represent
a
cave
before
its
entrance
lay
irregular
masses
of
rock
on
which
were
seated
some
of
the
misses
morven
in
their
attire
combing
their
dishevelled
locks
with
branches
of
coral
and
singing
the
while
like
the
syrens
of
old
till
on
the
approach
of
guests
they
would
dart
off
with
looks
of
well
feigned
wildness
into
the
mouth
of
the
cave
serving
thus
by
their
mockery
of
flight
as
guides
to
the
company
the
interior
of
the
cave
was
decorated
with
coral
growing
out
of
the
crevices
of
the
rock
and
budding
with
precious
stones
slender
gracefully
pendant
from
each
projecting
point
every
variety
of
magnificent
shell
from
some
of
which
seemed
to
proceed
strains
of
the
wildest
music
like
the
notes
of
eolian
harps
whilst
others
sent
forth
sounds
resembling
the
rushing
of
mighty
waters
under
foot
shone
golden
sands
promiscuously
strewn
with
pearls
and
variegated
pebbles
while
fragments
of
spar
and
crystal
containing
concealed
lamps
being
the
only
visible
sources
of
light
gave
to
the
whole
a
magical
effect
here
in
picturesque
attitudes
reclining
on
couches
of
feathery
and
rainbow
tinted
seaweed
appeared
the
principal
figures
of
the
group
they
too
were
singing
but
in
sweeter
strains
than
those
without
and
in
harmony
with
the
thrilling
breathings
still
proceeding
from
the
shells
on
the
entrance
of
the
guests
led
in
by
the
flying
misses
morven
the
recumbent
nymphs
gracefully
moving
their
arms
in
time
to
the
soft
music
by
looks
and
gestures
indicated
the
way
through
each
recess
of
the
cave
to
an
outlet
at
its
further
extremity
which
led
into
the
next
reception
room
the
advancing
company
now
found
themselves
in
a
seeming
grove
of
fine
old
oaks
the
stems
of
which
were
entwined
and
the
branches
festooned
with
laurel
triumphal
wreaths
of
the
latter
material
were
also
borne
aloft
in
the
joyous
dance
by
a
group
of
wearing
on
their
heads
crowns
and
over
their
shoulders
garlands
of
roses
with
which
were
intermingled
leaves
both
from
the
forest
tree
and
its
triumphal
wreathings
signifying
that
if
we
would
have
the
gentler
blossoms
of
our
gardens
flourish
the
oak
and
the
laurel
must
be
cultivated
all
who
entered
the
grove
in
naval
uniform
were
conducted
by
two
of
the
nymphs
to
an
open
space
among
the
trees
where
lady
susan
in
the
character
of
britannia
was
seated
on
a
beautiful
throne
curiously
carved
in
marble
to
represent
the
white
cliffs
of
albion
canopied
by
oaks
and
sheltered
on
either
side
by
a
luxuriant
growth
of
laurel
the
steps
of
the
throne
subject
waves
spell
bound
to
the
stillness
of
stone
by
the
presence
of
their
awful
mistress
while
on
one
of
them
stood
triton
with
his
conch
at
his
lips
in
the
attitude
of
awaiting
command
the
rich
harmonies
of
britannia
meantime
filled
the
air
every
where
as
though
the
old
oaks
themselves
had
been
the
performers
for
while
the
deeper
tones
seemed
to
come
mellowed
from
within
the
imprisonment
of
their
knotted
trunks
the
softer
ones
were
heard
whispering
at
large
among
the
waving
of
their
lofty
tops
each
claimant
being
led
to
the
feet
of
britannia
she
took
a
laurel
wreath
from
the
hands
of
her
attendant
nymphs
and
with
a
gracious
smile
a
triumphal
flourish
from
the
conch
of
triton
at
the
same
moment
proclaiming
the
act
placed
it
on
the
brows
of
the
hero
in
the
great
room
appeared
a
motley
crowd
in
the
costumes
of
all
the
nations
under
heaven
so
that
on
first
entering
a
eye
would
have
been
reminded
of
the
great
mart
at
gibraltar
lord
arandale
had
requested
that
all
officers
should
wear
uniform
edmund
could
not
therefore
without
incurring
the
charge
of
affectation
avoid
compliance
habited
accordingly
in
his
full
dress
or
roast
beef
coat
and
for
things
could
not
be
done
by
halves
decorated
with
every
star
and
garter
he
had
ever
won
he
made
his
appearance
in
the
marine
cave
but
having
fatally
neglected
the
precaution
taken
by
the
wise
ulysses
against
the
voices
of
syrens
he
found
it
quite
impossible
to
proceed
further
and
indeed
seemed
to
be
so
much
at
home
among
the
that
landsmen
as
they
passed
were
induced
to
make
many
witty
comments
vowing
they
would
never
again
compassionate
sailors
on
the
score
of
their
privations
they
had
heard
indeed
of
mermaids
and
read
of
syrens
but
as
the
former
were
proverbial
for
a
very
uninteresting
peculiarity
of
form
and
the
latter
were
called
by
johnson
they
had
no
idea
that
the
rocks
and
caves
of
old
ocean
were
inhabited
by
such
water
angels
as
those
they
now
beheld
lady
morven
appeared
as
a
sultana
dressed
in
all
that
could
be
devised
of
magnificence
having
some
taste
her
ladyship
made
many
deviations
from
the
hackneyed
one
the
groundwork
of
which
instead
of
being
of
the
strong
and
unbecoming
colours
generally
adopted
was
of
white
satin
though
that
pure
fabric
was
nearly
covered
with
rich
highly
raised
embroidery
of
the
most
brilliant
hues
mixed
with
gold
both
tunic
and
petticoat
were
deeply
bordered
and
fringed
with
gold
and
the
latter
adorned
with
peculiar
richness
up
the
front
where
the
opening
of
the
former
displayed
it
to
great
advantage
the
trowser
and
open
hanging
sleeve
were
of
course
not
forgotten
while
the
numberless
claspings
fastenings
and
loopings
bracelets
and
armlets
with
the
superb
zone
and
stomacher
necklace
and
crescent
all
of
jewels
chiefly
brilliants
brought
together
such
a
concentration
of
dazzling
rays
that
when
over
all
was
flung
a
veil
of
a
material
so
transparent
that
nothing
of
it
could
be
seen
but
the
beautiful
miniature
flowers
embroidered
in
gold
and
bright
colours
with
which
it
was
sprinkled
those
flowers
as
the
moving
of
the
invisible
drapery
caused
them
to
float
around
seemed
so
many
painted
and
glittering
butterflies
following
and
fluttering
in
the
blaze
of
light
emitted
by
so
much
splendour
the
bird
of
paradise
too
worn
in
front
of
the
turban
and
sustained
by
the
crescent
of
jewels
was
thus
so
severed
by
their
lustre
from
all
that
seemed
tangible
that
he
appeared
hovering
above
the
bright
vision
as
doubtful
where
to
alight
her
ladyship
leaned
on
the
arm
of
graham
who
had
assumed
the
dress
of
a
sultan
on
being
assured
that
it
would
not
be
required
of
him
to
do
any
thing
but
loll
on
an
ottoman
next
appeared
a
group
consisting
of
an
old
blind
man
selling
matches
and
led
by
a
excellent
figure
a
little
girl
driving
a
wheelbarrow
of
apples
and
calling
them
vociferously
and
a
woman
crying
the
last
dying
speech
of
the
latest
executed
murderer
now
a
group
of
circassian
slaves
now
a
number
of
naval
officers
arm
and
arm
now
many
curious
groups
of
wandering
musicians
ballad
singers
and
pedlars
of
various
countries
herds
of
foreign
peasants
then
came
turks
jews
dancers
these
last
children
their
queen
a
lovely
little
creature
leading
a
lamb
by
a
wreath
of
roses
while
the
gaily
decorated
pole
with
its
many
garlands
showered
the
fragrance
of
fresh
flowers
wherever
it
passed
then
a
group
of
archers
of
the
royal
edinburgh
society
in
short
enumeration
would
be
endless
next
appeared
a
set
of
gypsies
one
of
the
figures
very
old
man
with
grey
hair
and
bent
double
leading
an
excellent
imitation
of
a
small
donkey
animated
within
by
a
little
boy
and
bearing
on
the
centre
of
the
sack
which
was
thrown
across
its
back
an
infant
in
wax
seemingly
just
able
to
sit
in
a
little
heap
by
help
of
the
old
cloak
drawn
tight
about
it
the
deception
complete
this
group
took
the
liberty
of
making
a
halt
for
a
short
time
in
the
grove
where
under
one
of
the
old
trees
they
pitched
a
tent
and
from
a
projecting
branch
of
another
at
a
little
distance
suspended
a
kettle
under
which
they
set
fire
to
some
exquisite
perfumes
in
the
form
of
faggots
while
one
of
the
youngest
and
prettiest
of
their
party
sat
on
the
ground
blowing
the
embers
to
a
flame
without
other
means
than
her
own
rosy
lips
till
smoke
and
all
the
gipsey
encampment
formed
a
very
picturesque
object
among
the
gipsies
were
some
amusing
but
these
latter
were
all
thrown
into
shade
by
the
striking
figure
of
an
indian
juggler
who
came
in
soon
after
quite
alone
he
was
tall
and
dressed
in
long
loose
black
robes
instead
of
passing
on
he
paused
before
the
party
in
the
cave
waved
his
wand
and
looked
fixedly
at
them
his
countenance
was
covered
by
a
peculiarly
hideous
black
mask
through
which
his
eyes
flashed
with
a
supernatural
ferocity
assisted
by
fiery
regions
of
stained
crystal
around
the
apertures
he
made
signs
that
he
was
dumb
but
that
he
wished
to
show
julia
her
fortune
and
immediately
passing
his
wand
between
her
and
edmund
waved
to
all
to
make
a
clear
space
then
drawing
a
circle
round
julia
pointed
to
it
and
to
edmund
stamped
with
his
foot
and
seemed
to
forbid
his
passing
the
magic
boundary
edmund
made
several
laughing
attempts
to
enter
the
circle
but
the
juggler
as
often
interposed
his
wand
and
stamped
again
the
juggler
next
taking
henry
by
the
arm
placed
him
beside
julia
within
the
circle
i
am
to
be
the
happy
man
it
seems
said
henry
carelessly
taking
the
hand
of
his
cousin
she
appeared
not
to
like
the
jest
and
hastily
endeavoured
to
withdraw
her
hand
but
he
held
it
fast
giving
her
a
glance
which
made
her
tremble
the
juggler
now
displayed
a
ring
which
he
gave
to
henry
who
placed
it
on
finger
so
suddenly
that
she
was
not
aware
what
he
was
about
to
do
and
said
is
my
at
the
same
moment
the
words
is
my
husband
proceeded
or
seemed
to
proceed
from
the
lips
of
julia
in
a
voice
loud
and
distinct
though
unlike
that
in
which
she
usually
spoke
no
no
she
cried
instantly
in
her
own
voice
flinging
off
the
ring
and
darting
out
of
the
circle
yes
yes
said
a
voice
from
beneath
the
ground
on
which
they
stood
yes
yes
repeated
voices
from
within
the
rocks
on
every
side
successively
and
finally
from
above
their
heads
till
the
last
sound
seemed
lost
in
distance
the
juggler
the
while
pointing
with
his
wand
now
here
now
there
still
indicating
the
spot
whence
the
voice
seemed
to
proceed
it
not
you
then
that
said
this
is
my
husband
enquired
two
or
three
of
the
young
ladies
turning
to
julia
nonsense
she
exclaimed
pettishly
fellow
is
a
ventriloquist
said
edmund
aside
to
the
inquisitive
misses
morven
who
seemed
never
to
have
heard
one
before
at
the
same
time
approaching
our
heroine
he
offered
her
his
arm
for
she
seemed
to
need
support
and
he
felt
too
secretly
delighted
by
the
visible
antipathy
to
the
idea
of
a
union
with
henry
even
in
jest
evinced
by
the
countenance
and
involuntary
movements
of
julia
henry
however
drew
her
other
hand
over
his
arm
without
even
asking
her
permission
julia
he
said
laughing
heaven
we
are
married
at
last
and
publicly
enough
this
time
he
added
pretending
to
lower
his
voice
he
proceeded
again
raising
it
and
again
affecting
to
laugh
can
never
be
off
in
scotland
after
saying
before
two
witnesses
the
awful
is
my
husband
i
never
did
however
nor
ever
shall
say
so
commenced
julia
henry
interrupted
our
heroine
by
observing
carelessly
reminds
me
of
the
lady
in
the
play
who
swears
to
her
father
never
to
marry
her
lover
after
she
is
married
to
him
this
remark
though
made
with
the
greatest
levity
shocked
edmund
more
than
he
was
willing
to
confess
even
to
himself
not
that
at
the
time
he
believed
it
to
allude
to
any
thing
more
than
the
folly
which
had
just
passed
very
funny
how
very
funny
said
several
of
the
young
ladies
sort
of
jokes
are
very
disagreeable
i
think
said
julia
you
think
it
a
subject
for
jesting
upon
observed
henry
not
at
all
disconcerted
do
i
julia
believe
me
he
added
again
affecting
to
lower
his
voice
part
of
the
juggler
is
certainly
very
well
sustained
remarked
frances
very
well
indeed
said
julia
bowing
to
the
juggler
company
seem
to
be
almost
collected
she
added
i
think
we
may
now
go
to
the
great
room
and
commence
henry
thinking
he
had
now
sufficiently
plagued
julia
dropped
her
arm
and
offered
his
services
to
two
of
the
misses
morven
edmund
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
of
turning
to
our
heroine
and
saying
in
a
sake
julia
what
does
henry
mean
thinks
his
absurdity
wit
i
suppose
she
replied
without
hesitation
edmund
at
the
moment
felt
by
the
ready
frankness
of
her
manner
though
long
after
and
when
new
circumstances
had
arisen
he
remembered
that
the
words
of
her
reply
were
certainly
very
evasive
one
of
the
misses
morven
begged
to
have
her
fortune
told
the
juggler
drew
the
magic
circle
around
her
and
then
with
his
arms
folded
stood
motionless
the
unclaimed
damsel
looked
round
to
see
who
was
to
be
her
companion
the
juggler
waved
his
wand
as
though
interdicting
the
approach
of
any
intruder
the
spectators
began
to
laugh
and
the
young
lady
got
out
of
her
solitary
sphere
declaring
that
was
a
very
dull
amusement
chapter
xxv
seems
to
beckon
thee
to
his
our
group
at
length
entered
the
great
room
where
their
appearance
created
a
very
general
sensation
notwithstanding
the
immense
circle
already
formed
round
a
character
which
previous
to
their
entrance
had
been
the
centre
of
attraction
they
could
not
penetrate
near
enough
to
the
inner
part
of
the
ring
to
see
what
was
going
on
but
were
told
by
a
gentleman
who
was
politely
resigning
his
own
place
to
put
our
heroine
a
step
nearer
promotion
that
the
character
so
surrounded
was
certainly
the
best
which
had
yet
appeared
and
that
though
unmasked
no
one
could
make
him
out
would
have
been
a
thousand
pities
added
general
morven
whom
they
now
encountered
he
worn
a
mask
for
the
countenance
is
the
best
half
of
the
jest
he
looks
so
completely
in
earnest
so
truly
anxious
to
commend
and
sell
his
goods
said
our
first
informant
who
seemed
to
be
a
friend
of
the
for
they
shook
hands
and
generaled
and
admiraled
each
other
treats
every
one
rejoined
the
general
exactly
with
the
degree
of
respect
which
their
assumed
character
look
he
gave
the
woman
selling
the
last
dying
speech
would
immortalize
a
new
garrick
said
the
general
short
the
whole
thing
is
the
most
complete
piece
of
acting
i
ever
saw
his
expression
too
of
disappointment
and
astonishment
is
so
good
when
people
after
looking
at
and
pricing
things
walk
off
without
julia
and
frances
each
leaning
on
an
arm
of
edmund
had
by
this
time
with
the
assistance
of
the
general
and
his
friend
got
almost
to
the
front
of
the
circle
whence
who
should
they
behold
standing
in
the
centre
little
thinking
he
was
at
a
masquerade
and
striving
heart
and
soul
to
sell
his
fine
things
but
our
old
acquaintance
gotterimo
he
was
making
his
best
bows
to
lady
morven
who
in
the
blaze
of
jewels
we
have
already
described
was
seated
with
her
sultan
on
a
splendid
ottoman
ere
however
we
proceed
to
relate
what
immediately
followed
we
must
account
for
our
poor
little
friend
being
found
in
such
good
company
having
on
his
return
to
town
made
some
discoveries
respecting
the
valuables
pawned
by
the
famous
swindler
which
from
the
great
interest
evinced
by
montgomery
in
the
mosaics
he
thought
might
be
of
consequence
to
a
family
that
had
so
greatly
befriended
him
he
determined
to
make
his
next
travelling
speculation
attendance
on
the
ayrshire
race
meeting
and
at
its
conclusion
to
proceed
to
lord
castle
and
give
his
lordship
the
important
information
various
accidents
so
delayed
our
little
traveller
on
the
cross
road
that
he
did
not
arrive
at
arandale
till
many
hours
later
than
he
intended
when
he
came
to
the
lodge
gates
he
found
them
all
open
and
the
grounds
as
he
proceeded
covered
with
lights
merry
groups
be
von
fair
thought
gotterimo
and
he
debated
with
himself
whether
he
should
not
take
the
opportunity
of
doing
a
little
business
but
on
second
thoughts
he
decided
that
an
out
of
door
fair
held
by
was
no
place
to
expose
for
sale
such
valuable
articles
as
those
of
which
his
stock
consisted
he
continued
his
way
therefore
towards
the
castle
this
he
found
also
lit
up
while
beneath
its
illuminated
colonnade
ascending
its
steps
and
entering
its
open
portals
he
observed
a
motley
crowd
many
of
whom
as
the
seller
of
matches
were
of
much
lower
degree
than
himself
he
could
therefore
feel
no
scruples
in
entering
he
saw
also
in
the
first
hall
many
who
appeared
prepared
to
turn
a
penny
as
well
as
himself
for
some
had
packs
on
their
backs
some
baskets
in
their
hands
with
perfumery
pastry
pamphlets
newspapers
he
also
saw
as
many
or
more
persons
whose
appearance
justified
the
hope
of
their
making
costly
purchases
be
de
place
for
me
thought
gotterimo
the
crowd
in
the
hall
were
moving
onward
and
he
moved
with
them
vill
just
go
fere
i
see
de
odder
go
he
thought
he
observed
each
person
as
they
passed
a
respectable
looking
man
in
black
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
present
a
card
this
appeared
to
him
a
very
regular
and
proceeding
he
determined
therefore
to
do
the
like
and
taking
out
one
of
his
own
cards
indicating
the
articles
he
had
for
sale
and
the
street
and
number
of
his
shop
in
bath
he
handed
it
to
the
butler
who
stood
receiving
almost
at
the
same
moment
so
many
tickets
that
the
nature
of
deposit
was
unnoticed
he
now
ascended
the
great
stairs
without
further
obstacle
admiring
as
he
went
the
magnificent
carpets
which
were
spread
beneath
his
feet
on
every
step
the
rich
candelabras
which
were
held
aloft
by
statues
of
bronze
on
every
landing
and
the
splendid
liveries
of
the
servants
who
everywhere
pointed
the
way
gold
in
any
shape
was
never
lost
on
gotterimo
he
passed
through
the
cave
at
a
time
when
it
was
so
much
crowded
that
he
was
not
observed
by
his
friends
the
nor
did
he
see
them
so
entirely
was
his
attention
absorbed
examining
the
pearls
that
lay
scattered
beneath
his
feet
to
ascertain
if
any
of
them
were
real
finding
them
however
to
be
but
imitation
he
passed
on
through
the
grove
to
the
great
room
here
his
ears
were
at
once
assailed
with
oystairs
buy
my
primroses
and
unnatural

cruel
murder
strawberries
ripe
strawberries
apples
large
apples
large
apples
and
now
a
light
wheelbarrow
impelled
forward
with
the
speed
of
a
velocipede
by
as
light
a
little
girl
ran
up
against
him
and
almost
upset
itself
by
driving
over
his
feet

gotterimo
i
no

no

for
such
foolish
a
richly
dressed
group
now
came
in
view
and
gotterimo
thought
he
might
have
done
great
deal
of
business
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
ungenerous
interference
of
a
noisy
obtrusive
while
he
offered
for
sale
rouge

accommodated
to
the

and

displaying
for

benefit
of
single
gentlemen
a
long
list
of
the
names
of
rich
widows
and
great
heiresses
soon
after
this
it
was
that
our
party
having
as
we
have
described
pressed
their
way
through
the
surrounding
crowd
first
discovered
in
the
object
of
general
curiosity
their
little
friend
gotterimo
he
was
at
the
moment
as
we
have
stated
making
all
his
best
bows
to
lady
morven
and
graham
the
splendour
of
whose
appearance
had
filled
his
bosom
with
hopes
almost
as
dazzling
as
the
constellation
before
which
he
worshipped
lord
arandale
now
joining
the
group
a
grand
denouement
took
place
after
much
ado
the
poor
little
intruder
was
got
to
comprehend
in
some
degree
his
situation
at
least
to
know
that
all
the
mob
which
surrounded
him
consisted
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
though
why
many
of
them
should
choose
to
appear
so
little
like
such
might
not
perhaps
come
quite
within
the
scope
of
his
comprehension
motives
for
visiting
arandale
having
been
in
the
first
few
moments
explained
to
the
earl
his
lordship
with
his
smile
whispered
about
among
his
friends
the
true
quality
of
the
supposed
well
sustained
character
the
buzz
went
round
and
gotterimo
on
his
progress
through
the
rooms
to
make
his
exit
was
so
often
intercepted
by
such
as
wished
either
to
oblige
their
noble
host
or
reward
the
little
man
for
the
amusement
he
had
afforded
themselves
that
our
boxes
were
quickly
cleared
of
all
their
contents
and
at
prices
highly
satisfactory
to
the
vendor
who
on
perceiving
that
he
obtained
whatever
he
demanded
not
from
the
ignorance
but
from
the
whim
of
the
purchasers
began
to
think
it
no
great
sin
to
raise
the
market
a
little
immediately
after
the
interruption
occasioned
by
adventures
our
and
led
by
britannia
herself
formed
for
a
peculiar
dance
the
plan
of
which
had
been
previously
arranged
the
figure
was
to
take
in
the
whole
of
the
united
group
and
on
a
signal
given
by
the
music
the
young
respective
partners
in
whatever
disguise
were
to
join
them

they
stood

their
places

filled
up
the
party
till
julia
alone
stood
unclaimed
and
at
the
same
time
importunately
beset
for
alms
by
the
old
blind
man
who
sold
matches
he
was
bent
double
a
profusion
of
white
hair
fell
around
his
patched
and
ragged
shoulders
he
held
in
one
hand
his
hat
crutch
and
the
string
by
which
his
dog
was
fastened
while
his
other
hand
was
stretched
forth
with
a
beseeching
palm
and
in
the
piteous
and
tremulous
accents
of
extreme
age
he
craved
her
compassion
at
length
to
humour
the
jest
she
offered
him
a
small
donation
this
the
mendicant
bent
on
one
knee
to
receive
grasping
as
he
did
so
and
firmly
retaining
the
hand
that
presented
it
in
one
of
his
while
with
the
other
he
flung
off
his
disguises
and
sprang
to
his
feet

and

for

was
thrown
out
by
his
absence
from
the
breakfast
table
when
the
engagements
for
this
dance
were
being
formed
and
who
consequently
was
but
a
spectator
felt
his
arm
touched
from
behind
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
beheld
the
juggler
who
turning
made
signs
to
him
to
follow
he
did
not
however
feel
disposed
to
take
the
hint
the
dumb
pressed
nearer
and
said
in
a
low

edmund
he
turned
and
immediately
followed
must
be
some
impertinent
jest
he
said
to
himself
angry
at
his
own
credulity
it
is
just
possible
something
that
some
one
connected
with
my
strange
history
have
the
dark
figure
meanwhile
glided
as
rapidly
through
the
dense
crowd
as
if
there
had
been
no
obstacle
to
its
free
passage
it
was
with
difficulty
just
kept
in
view

on

the
mysterious
stranger
our
hero
still
following
descended
the
great
stairs
crossed
the
inner
and
and
went
out
at
the
great
door
then
hurrying
past
the
flaring
flambeaux
of
the
servants
in
attendance
on
waiting
carriages
made
for
a
thick
grove
at
a
considerable
distance
arrived
at
the
grove
the
figure
proceeded
some
way
among
the
thickest
of
the
trees
edmund
followed
for
a
time
in
silence
at
length
he
demanded
rather
angrily
whither
the
fellow
meant
to
lead
him
the
stranger
made
no
reply
but
continued
his
rapid
pace
towards
the
most
remote
and
by
there
appearing
no
lights
in
that
direction
evidently
the
most
unfrequented
part
of
the
grounds
will
follow
no
further
said
edmund
standing
still
after
a
quick
pursuit
of
some
minutes
there
is
indeed
any
important
communication
which
it
is
necessary
should
be
made
to
me
in
private
we
have
been
long
since
far
enough
removed
from
all
possibility
of
being
the
juggler
stopped
and
faced
about
man
he
said
may
well
believe
that
my
business
here
this
evening
was
not
to
play
the
idle
mummery
you
have
witnessed
follow
me
therefore
your
business

me
name
it
now
and
here
said
edmund
the
stranger
fixed
his
eyes
on
those
of
our
hero
while
beneath
his
cloak
he
grasped
something
which
edmund
almost
held
out
his
hand
to
receive
so
sure
did
he
feel
for
the
moment
that
it
must
be
a
packet
of
papers
containing
the
information
he
so
much
desired
to
obtain
the
hand
appeared
to
hesitate
the
fellow
spoke
again
perhaps
to
gain
time
daughter
of
lord
he
said
slowly
his
eyes
still
fixed
on
edmund
never
be
the
wife
of
he
paused
drew
a
step
nearer
then
recommenced
you
shall
know
of
whom
at
this
crisis
there
might
be
danger
in
the
will
know
all
this
moment
exclaimed
edmund
why
have
i
been
led
here
i
will
not
be
trifled
with
sir
if
your
words
have
any
meaning
explain
them
if
they
have
none
and
that
you
have
dared
to
make
my
most
sacred
feelings
the
subject
of
an
impertinent
and
indelicate
jest
be
assured
that
whoever
you
may
be
you
shall
answer
to
me
for
such
so
saying
he
seized
a
firm
hold
of
the
cloak
the
ruffian
turned
with
a
sort
of
triumphant
laugh
grasped
right
arm
with
his
left
hand
while
with
his
right
he
drew
a
sword
from
beneath
his
cloak
and
made
a
thrust
at
our
unprepared
hero
edmund
however
by
a
single
fortunate
effort
disengaged
himself
evaded
the
first
thrust
drew
his
sword
and
intercepted
the
second
the
villain
made
another
and
another
stroke
each
of
which
our
hero
parried
with
equal
success
when
the
now
infuriated
ruffian
with
a
sudden
leap
backward
and
bound
forward
made
a
direct
lunge
at
the
breast
of
his
intended
victim
which
as
our
hero
at
the
instant
dexterously
sprang
aside
came
with
such
force
on
the
trunk
of
the
tree
in
front
of
which
he
had
stood
but
the
second
before
that
the
sword
of
his
ferocious
assailant
was
shattered
to
the
very
hilt
edmund
now
resting
the
point
of
his
weapon
on
the
ground
commanded
the
man
whom
he
considered
in
no
condition
to
resist
being
disarmed
to
return
with
him
to
the
castle
for
reply
the
juggler
drew
a
pistol
from
the
belt
beneath
his
cloak
and
thrusting
it
close
to
our
face
fired
the
steadiness
of
the
hand
must
have
been
previously
shaken
by
the
force
with
which
his
sword
had
struck
against
the
trunk
of
the
tree
for
the
lighting
charge
shot
perpendicularly
upwards
like
a
throwing
the
pistol
from
him
and
cursing
it
aloud
the
villain
drew
out
the
second
levelled
it
better
and
was
in
the
act
of
pulling
the
trigger
when
edmund
by
this
time
more
on
his
guard
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
strike
its
muzzle
aside
with
his
sword
the
balls
flew
through
the
trees
wide
of
the
intended
aim
the
juggler
stood
a
moment
confounded
then
eyed
raised
arm
as
if
meditating
a
dart
at
it
with
the
desperate
purpose
of
possessing
himself
of
the
weapon
it
held
but
the
threatening
position
of
the
blade
seemed
to
deter
him
while
the
noise
of
the
shots
having
arrested
the
attention
of
the
nearest
group
of
their
flambeaux
were
seen
by
their
quick
movements
to
express
instant
alarm
crossing
and
recrossing
each
other
in
great
confusion
then
they
separated
in
every
possible
direction
resembling
wandering
meteors
through
the
surrounding
darkness
while
each
moving
star
was
accompanied
by
a
voice
crying
thieves
thieves
as
they
evidently
approached
guided
by
directing
call
to
the
spot
on
which
he
stood
the
hitherto
determined
ruffian
now
turned
and
fled
edmund
pursued
and
was
at
first
so
close
behind
him
that
he
again
laid
hold
of
the
cloak
which
however
now
yielded
itself
a
too
easy
captive
while
its
owner
darted
round
a
thick
clump
of
wood
and
was
seen
no
more
all
who
came
up
of
course
assisted
in
the
pursuit
or
rather
search
but
in
vain
from
the
moment
the
fugitive
was
first
lost
sight
of
no
one
knew
in
what
direction
to
seek
him
some
suggested
that
he
had
most
probably
turned
back
favoured
by
the
shelter
of
the
trees
and
throwing
off
such
of
his
disguises
as
might
lead
to
a
recognition
of
his
person
joined
the
throng
of
his
own
pursuers
indeed
the
multitude
of
people
on
the
grounds
at
the
time
was
so
great
that
to
have
traced
among
them
an
unknown
individual
and
in
the
dark
too
was
a
thing
so
totally
out
of
the
range
of
possibility
that
the
idea
was
soon
given
up
on
the
part
of
edmund
certainly
with
infinite
regret
for
he
was
very
unwilling
to
resign
the
not
irrational
hope
he
had
for
a
short
time
entertained
of
discovering
something
of
his
own
mysterious
fate
even
by
finding
out
who
had
an
interest
in
his
destruction
a
very
little
reflection
however
served
to
convince
him
that
any
further
attempt
at
pursuit
must
be
perfectly
vain
for
if
the
villain
were
even
seized
how
was
he
to
be
identified
no
one
had
seen
him
unmasked
and
the
very
proportions
of
his
figure
had
been
concealed
by
his
robes
much
disappointed
therefore
our
hero
bent
his
steps
towards
the
castle
which
the
alarm
had
not
yet
reached
chapter
xxvii
author
of
that
crime
he
my
father
edmund
on
his
return
to
the
ball
room
made
the
best
of
his
way
scarcely
conscious
what
he
did
to
the
very
spot
he
had
left
where
fixing
his
eyes
again
on
the
same
object
on
which
he
had
been
gazing
when
called
away
by
the
juggler
he
fell
into
a
profound
reverie
could
have
been
the
motive
of
the
violence
offered
him
to
whom
could
his
whom
could
his
destruction
be
of
so
much
importance
he
was
not
then
too
contemptible
to
have
enemies
a
strange
sensation
approaching
to
satisfaction
accompanied
the
thought
the
bustle
attendant
on
changing
partners
reminded
him
that
julia
was
engaged
to
him
for
the
next
set
he
put
in
his
claim
and
was
soon
recalled
to
a
sense
of
pleasure
for
julia
was
leaning
on
his
arm
a
shudder
followed
however
as
he
thought
of
the
mysterious
words
of
the
ruffian
stranger
again
and
again
he
told
himself
that
they
had
been
uttered
but
to
throw
him
off
his
guard
while
the
villain
spoke
had
not
his
eye
been
ever
watchful
had
not
his
hand
grasped
the
drawn
sword
beneath
his
cloak
evidently
awaiting
a
moment
of
excited
feeling
to
strike
the
blow
the
more
securely
but
this
solution
of
the
affair
rational
and
just
as
it
was
did
not
suffice
to
set
his
mind
at
rest
might
he
not
be
connected
with
family
in
some
way
as
disgraceful
to
himself
as
fatal
to
his
mad
attachment
might
not
some
secret
agent
have
been
in
consequence
employed
to
put
an
end
to
his
miserable
existence
lest
he
should
entail
disgrace
and
crime
on
all
connected
with
him
there
were
then
beings
connected
with
him
who
were
those
beings
and
where
were
they
a
thought
of
horror
next
crossed
his
mind
could
it
have
been
a
parent
who
had
employed
the
hand
to
blot
out
shame
with
blood
and
his
heart
shrunk
from
a
surmise
too
dreadful
to
be
dwelt
upon
it
had
been
previously
arranged
that
the
dance
now
about
to
commence
was
to
take
place
in
another
apartment
the
couples
accordingly
set
out
julia
and
edmund
led
their
own
party
while
before
behind
and
on
either
side
moved
a
consolidated
crowd
in
the
same
direction
so
that
retreat
from
the
relative
position
once
taken
up
was
quite
out
of
the
question
our
hero
and
heroine
were
consequently
obliged
to
keep
for
a
considerable
time
a
very
painful
situation
in
the
immediate
rear
of
a
talkative
party
who
without
once
looking
behind
them
proceeded
with
the
following
dialogue
seem
to
abound
in
naval
characters
observed
a
gentleman
know
it
is
quite
a
naval
affair
said
a
naval
officer

of
the
battle
of

worth
remembering

a
lady

said
a
second
lady
is

montgomery
with
emphasis
on
the
word
said
a
third
lady
who
was
by
her
own
size
and
weight
making
way
for
two
slim
little
girls
her
daughters
who
by
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
were
squeezed
into
the
fat
sides
of
their
mother
like
the
of
a
bulbous
root
is
a
question
not
so
easily
answered
replied
an
equally
fat
gentleman
he
any
relation
of
lord
enquired
some
one
whatever
replied
an
elderly
naval
officer
dryly
then
was
merely
his
patron
said
a
young
naval
officer
resumed
the

one
half
the

shown
by
captain

have
ensured
to
any
young
man

enthusiastic
about
the

a
very
gay
fellow

his
youth

a
corpulent
gentleman
captain
montgomery
being
of
unknown
origin
may
after
all
be
no
very
distant
relation
of
his

rejoined
the

give

half
his
paternal
estates
for
such
a
son
even
in
the
way
to
which
you

fellow
is

out
the
corpulent

he
is
strikingly
like
his
are
some
officers
on
before
us
said
one
of
the
young
ladies
wonder
is
captain
montgomery
among
them
quite
long
to
see
him
i
understand
he
is
so
handsome
said
a
third
lady
seems
to
be
a
general
favourite
with
the
ladies
said
the

officer
is
to
be
married
shortly
i

to

susan

that
she
has
fifty
thousand
lady
julia
i
have
heard
interposed
the
elder
officer
beg
your
pardon
said
the
fat
lady
julia
is
to
be
married
immediately
to
the
marquis
of
more
suitable
match
no
doubt
replied
the
elder
officer
heiresses
will
sometimes
please
themselves
you
know
and
i
have
heard
that
lady
julia
has
been
attached
to
captain
montgomery
from
her
infancy
and
that
she
is
determined
to
marry
him
in
spite
of
all
her
friends
as
soon
as
she
shall
be
of
just
at
this
particular
moment
edmund
found
the
impelling
torrent
press
so
weightily
against
his
fair
companion
that
it
was
absolutely
imperative
upon
him
to
draw
her
closer
to
himself
than
she
had
been

estates
added
the
younger
officer

between
his
daughters
at
his
death
whoever
they
marry
so
the
gallant
captain
knows
what
he
is
about
it
is
accustomed
to
capturing
rich
prizes
said
the
corpulent
gentleman
a
laugh
followed
this
most
original
piece
of
wit
friends
interposed
the
plump
lady
never
consent
to
a
young
woman
of
her
high
connexions
throwing
herself
away
upon
a
mere
soldier
of
have
always
understood
observed
another
gentleman
lady
julia
was
engaged
to
her
cousin
aubin
indeed
i
had
it
from
one
who
i
think
said
that
he
had
it
from
aubin
himself
or
at
least
that
aubin
admitted
all
this
passed
among
a
group
who
though
masked
evidently
knew
each
other
their
arrival
at
the
apartment
they
had
been
all
this
time
imperceptibly
approaching
and
the
consequent
spreading
of
the
crowd
at
length
enabled
julia
and
edmund
to
hasten
from
the
vicinity
of
the
party
which
had
so
long
annoyed
them
edmund
notwithstanding
his
causes
for
abstraction
was
aroused
by
topics
so
interesting
he
thought
of
the
strange
aside
speeches
of
henry
during
the
mummery
of
the
juggler
and
longed
to
know
how
julia
would
treat
the
subject
of
her
supposed
engagement
to
her
cousin
as
to
what
had
been
said
of
himself
he
dare
not
allude
to
it
he
dare
not
even
think
of
it
at
length
he
ventured
to
whisper
a
sort
of
introductory
sentence
in
the
shape
of
an
unmeaning
compliment
enviable
a
lot
would
be
if
there
were
any
truth
in
the
surmises
of
those
people
julia
blushed
but
made
no
reply
so
absurd
a
report
did
not
seem
to
require
contradiction
and
as
she
was
too
innocent
to
think
any
compliment
of
unmeaning
his
implied
question
was
lost
in
the
pleasure
of
hearing
him
say
that
to
be
preferred
by
her
would
be
an
enviable
lot
nor
did
she
perceive
that
her
silence
and
her
blush
had
at
least
surprised
if
not
alarmed
him
the
dance
now
commenced
and
put
an
end
to
conversation
it
concluded
and
edmund
as
he
led
julia
out
of
the
set
began
to
say
something
about
the
necessity
he
should
be
under
of
leaving
arandale
the
next
morning
at
a
very
early
hour
in
pursuance
of
the
journey
which
was
this
morning
so
agreeably
interrupted
at
this
moment
hand
was
claimed
by
lord
previous
to
sitting
down
to
supper
the
whole
assembly
assumed
an
appearance
of
uninterrupted
splendour
every
coarse
or
unbecoming
disguise
was
exchanged
for
its
very
opposite
of
elegance
or
magnificence
every
one
being

to
look

well
as
possible

performed

of

of

those

could
perceive
notwithstanding
the
efforts
he
made
to
entertain
his
company
that
during
this
evening
of
unparalleled
gaiety
and
splendour
there
was
a
slight
shade
of
melancholy
on
his
brow
and
a
tendency

hour

did

at

his

of

night
before
with

business
to
all
the
servants
and
by
the
servants
to
their
respective
masters
and
mistresses
it
was
now
universally
talked
of
by
those
we
mean
who
could
talk
some
there
were
who
could
not
trust
their
lips
with
the
utterance
of
a
single
syllable
who
could
thus
desire
the
amiable
destruction
baffled
all
conjecture
there
was
but
one
rational
supposition
the
earl
said
the
villain
must
have
been
employed
by
some
one
acquainted
with
those
concealed
facts
which
had
hitherto
surrounded
their
young
fate
with
mystery
some
one
whose
interest
would
materially
suffer
by
the
development
of
that
mystery
while
at
the
same
time
there
was
most
probably
some
event
about
to
take
place
which
threatened
to
produce
that
development
edmund
must
be
still
in
danger
exclaimed
frances
starting
upright
from
her
seat
and
clasping
her
hands
julia
sat
trembling
and
as
pale
as
death
but
neither
moved
nor
spoke
the
butler
entered
with
rolls
he
was
asked
if
he
could
be
certain
that
no
one
had
been
admitted
without
a
ticket
he
was
quite
certain
he
had
himself
taken
the
ticket
of
each
person
who
passed
the
first
hall
even
the
little
pedlar
had
presented
a
card
which
happening
to
be
of
similar
dimensions
to
the
tickets
he
the
butler
unfortunately
had
not
examined
at
the
time
and
which
when
examined
afterwards
proved
to
be
one
belonging
to
the
shop
in
bath
this
was
the
only
ticket
which
was
not
correct
of
the
full
number
issued
it
was
strange
tickets
had
not
been
given
to
any
friends
to
give
to
friends
of
theirs
with
the
exception
of
a
very
few
to
edmund
himself
and
to
henry
for
naval
officers
of
their
acquaintance
when
the
subject
had
been
thus
discussed
in
all
its
bearings
the
earl
who
still
looked
serious
and
even
melancholy
said
am
not
sorry
that
captain
montgomery
has
taken
arthur
with
him
it
would
have
been
a
sad
scene
for
the
poor
little
fellow
our
friend
sir
archibald
oswald
he
added
after
a
solemn
pause
and
looking
round
the
company
no
more
the
state
of
his
mind
will
i
trust
acquit
him
in
the
eyes
of
heaven
as
it
undoubtedly
must
in
the
judgment
of
men
but
there
is
reason
to
fear
that
our
unhappy
friend
has
been
accessary
to
his
own
death
his
body
was
yesterday
found
in
the
lake
by
the
work
people
who
were
preparing
for
the
illuminations
duncan
very
properly
suppressed
the
circumstance
till
he
had
communicated
it
privately
to
me
and
i
judged
it
best
to
permit
the
entertainment
offered
to
our
friends
to
proceed
without
checking
the
pleasure
of
the
company
by
the
introduction
of
so
melancholy
a
miss
morven
thought
that
aubin
was
certainly
a
very
amiable
young
man
he
showed
so
much
feeling
he
actually
turned
quite
pale
when
her
uncle
mentioned
sir
body
being
found
in
the
lake
many
of
course
were
the
exclamations
of
pity
and
surprise
will
be
quite
a
change
of
scene
continued
the
earl
must
send
for
the
proper
persons
and
if
their
verdict
is
as
i
have
no
doubt
it
will
be
insanity
i
must
give
my
poor
friend
a
suitable
chapter
xxix
fiercely
grapples
with
his
i
then
thee
to
account
for
sir
archibald
disappearance
from
arandale
and
the
subsequent
discovery
of
his
body
in
the
lake
we
must
accompany
him
in
a
walk
before
breakfast
on
the
morning
after
he
had
evinced
so
much
emotion
the
previous
evening
first
of
a
furious
description
when
voice
arrested
his
attention
and
finally
of
a
tender
and
subdued
nature
when
on
hearing
julia
sing
all
violence
had
not
only
been
allayed
but
unconscious
tears
had
flowed
over
his
haggard
countenance
having
retired
without
supper
and
consequently
without
the
excess
in
wine
which
with
him
too
frequently
formed
the
principal
part
of
that
meal
the
unhappy
oswald
slept
better
than
was
his
custom
he
rose
earlier
he
felt
some
degree
of
composure
a
lucid
interval
was
probably
approaching
he
wandered
into
the
deep
woods
that
surround
arandale
castle
the
solitude
they
afforded
was
of
a
cheering
and
animated
kind
stately
deer
crossed
his
path
birds
sang
and
peacocks
screamed
in
every
branch
and
the
cawing
rooks
were
as
usual
in
busy
motion
in
and
over
the
tops
of
all
the
high
old
trees
the
path
he
chanced
to
take
led
him
to
the
sheet
of
water
before
noticed
our
old
acquaintances
the
two
swans
were
slowly
sailing
on
its
calm
surface
half
the
quiet
bosom
of
the
lake
was
in
deep
shadow
from
the
great
trees
which
seemed
resting
the
weight
of
their
branches
upon
it
the
other
half
shone
brightly
in
the
early
sun
and
every
leaf
every
blade
of
grass
which
amid
so
much
cover
the
rays
of
light
could
reach
was
glittering
with
dew
the
morning
air
was
exhilarating
broken
heart
felt
soothed
by
the
influence
of
surrounding
objects
he
stood
contemplating
the
scene
with
calmer
feelings
than
were
common
to
him
there
was
a
peculiar
stillness
in
the
moment
the
next
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
fell
on
his
ear
he
looked
round
and
beheld
as
he
believed
one
who
had
long
been
the
object
of
his
search
and
of
his
hatred
coming
towards
him
oswald
stamped
on
the
earth
uttered
a
yell
at
once
of
triumph
and
defiance
his
eyes
flashed
with
the
fire
of
phrenzy
he
gnashed
his
teeth
his
whole
countenance
became
distorted
with
the
horrible
rage
of
a
maniac
henry
paused
for
it
was
indeed
this
unfortunate
son
of
a
desperate
father
whom
the
bewildered
perceptions
of
the
madman
had
mistaken
for
that
father
a
father
whose
very
memory
could
thus
entail
on
his
offspring
not
only
the
wild
vengeance
of
others
but
almost
a
necessity
in
himself
to
become
the
perpetrator
of
crime
actual
if
not
intentional
henry
saw
and
endeavoured
to
avoid
oswald
but
the
unhappy
being
crossed
his
path
and
seized
on
his
throat
with
violence
reiterating
villain
villain
accusing
him
of
deeds
of
the
blackest
dye
and
calling
upon
him
with
threats
and
imprecations
to
restore
the
rights
of
his
son
at
first
henry
to
do
him
justice
only
sought
to
escape
next
only
to
defend
himself
but
when
it
became
evident
that
the
purpose
was
to
put
him
to
death
and
that
with
that
purpose
was
coupled
an
insane
glee
at
the
immediate
prospect
of
its
fulfilment
and
that
added
to
all
this
henry
began
to
feel
himself
actually
threatened
with
strangulation
his
own
angry
passions
kindled
and
he
put
his
strength
to
the
struggle
oswald
however
having
at
first
fastened
on
cravat
maintained
his
hold
with
the
ferocious
tenacity
of
a
and
pursued
his
advantage
with
the
supernatural
force
derived
from
phrenzy
there
were
moments
when
henry
gave
himself
up
for
lost
it
was
now
that
he
forgot
his
age
and
imbecility
of
mind
and
with
all
the
strength
of
youthful
sinews
clasped
his
arms
round
the
old
waist
and
in
a
few
seconds
brought
him
to
the
ground
here
the
sight
of
grey
hairs
lying
amid
the
grass
and
fallen
leaves
might
have
recalled
better
feelings
but
even
here
the
poor
fury
was
unabated
his
countenance
still
expressed
his
horrible
intention
and
his
hand
still
grasped
the
cravat
of
henry
in
the
latter
the
instinct
of
grew
each
moment
more
fierce
the
efforts
of
oswald
even
in
this
prostrate
position
continued
for
a
time
as
frantic
as
ever
when
suddenly
all
became
still
the
hands
had
relaxed
their
hold
and
henry
gazed
in
mute
horror
and
unavailing
remorse
on
a
a
lifeless
form
as
motionless
is
not
murder
he
at
length
murmured
is
not
murder
he
repeated
but
no
false
arguments
could
stifle
the
shocking
conviction
to
which
his
suddenly
cooled
faculties
had
awakened
the
conviction
that
a
too
fatal
fierceness
had
accompanied
the
pressure
with
which
he
had
held
the
fallen
madman
to
the
earth
after
immediate
danger
to
himself
had
ceased
the
vital
breath
suspended
by
wild
excitement
and
frantic
exertion
might
have
would
have
returned
had
not
that
cruelly
continued
pressure
impeded
the
efforts
of
nature
such
feelings
however
shortly
yielded
to
a
dread
of
the
consequences
of
what
had
happened
attended
thus
by
at
least
very
suspicious
circumstances
he
stood
up
and
looked
all
round
him
it
was
solitude
everywhere
and
hat
had
rolled
into
the
lake
he
seized
the
thought
drew
the
body
towards
the
margin
and
pushed
it
in
also
it
sunk
and
the
water
closed
over
it
henry
gazed
on
the
spot
whence
it
had
disappeared
till
the
last
spreading
circle
had
melted
away
then
turned
to
depart
but
started
and
shuddered
on
beholding
full
attentive
eyes
fixed
upon
him
as
it
were
observing
his
movements
for
a
moment
he
felt
detected
but
the
next
recovered
from
his
panic
for
the
eyes
were
only
those
of
a
stately
deer
the
animal
stood
at
a
little
distance
beneath
a
tree
his
face
turned
full
round
his
head
proudly
erect
sustaining
the
weight
of
his
branching
horns
henry
envied
him
and
now
striking
hastily
into
a
walk
that
led
towards
the
castle
he
debated
with
himself
in
great
agitation
whether
he
should
mention
what
had
happened
to
lord
arandale
pleading
the
dreadful
necessity
of
against
a
maniac
who
would
else
have
taken
his
life
or
whether
he
should
remain
silent
and
suffer
it
to
be
supposed
that
oswald
had
drowned
himself
that
such
a
man
should
commit
an
act
of
suicide
could
not
surprise
any
one
and
henry
therefore
determined
on
the
latter
alternative
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
he
entered
the
on
the
first
morning
of
the
races
just
as
lady
arandale
was
enquiring
of
the
butler
if
any
one
had
been
in
sir
room
it
was
at
this
breakfast
that
lady
susan
had
observed
on
not
having
any
appetite
it
may
now
too
be
imagined
what
his
feelings
of
consternation
must
have
been
when
within
an
hour
after
little
arthur
mistaking
him
for
edmund
laid
hold
of
the
side
of
his
coat
and
asked
him
in
a
cautious
whisper
where
his
poor
papa
was
the
body
of
sir
archibald
oswald
over
which
we
have
seen
the
peaceful
surface
of
the
waters
close
rose
again
at
the
usual
time
but
before
any
one
had
chanced
to
visit
a
place
so
sequestered
both
it
and
the
hat
had
been
gently
borne
along
towards
a
narrow
outlet
at
the
further
end
of
the
lake
and
received
into
the
strait
or
pass
which
was
too
confined
to
allow
of
their
further
progress
and
here
they
might
still
have
lain
had
not
the
work

mentioned
