on

chapter
i
mostly
tony
among
the
voluble
excited
crowd
that
boarded
the
northampton
train
at
springfield
two
male
passengers
were
conspicuous
for
their
silence
as
they
sat
absorbed
in
their
respective
newspapers
which
each
had
hurriedly
purchased
in
transit
from
train
to
train
a
striking
enough
contrast
otherwise
however
the
two
presented
the
man
next
the
aisle
was
well
past
sixty
rotund
of
abdomen
rubicund
of
countenance
he
was
elaborately
almost
foppish
in
attire
and
wore
the
obvious
stamp
of
worldly
success
the
air
of
one
accustomed
to
giving
orders
and
seeing
them
obeyed
before
his
eyes
his
companion
and
chance
was
young
probably
a
scant
five
and
twenty
tall
lean
of
frame
with
finely
chiseled
almost
ascetic
features
though
the
vigorous
chin
and
generous
sized
mouth
forbade
any
hint
of
weakness
or
effeminacy
his
clear
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
youth
but
they
would
have
set
a
keen
observer
to
wondering
what
they
had
seen
to
leave
that
shadow
of
unyouthful
gravity
upon
them
it
happened
that
both
men
the
elderly
and
the
young
had
their
papers
folded
at
identically
the
same
page
and
both
were
studying
intently
the
face
of
the
lovely
young
girl
who
smiled
out
of
the
duplicate
printed
sheets
impartially
at
both
the
legend
beneath
the
cut
explained
that
the
young
beauty
was
miss
antoinette
holiday
who
would
play
rosalind
that
night
in
the
smith
college
annual
senior
dramatics
the
interested
reader
was
further
enlightened
to
the
fact
that
miss
holiday
was
the
daughter
of
the
late
colonel
holiday
and
laura
larue
a
well
known
actress
of
a
generation
ago
and
that
the
daughter
inherited
the
gifts
as
well
as
the
beauty
of
her
famous
mother
and
was
said
to
be
planning
to
follow
the
stage
herself
having
made
her
debut
as
the
charming
heroine
of
as
you
like
it
the
man
next
the
aisle
frowned
a
little
as
he
came
to
this
last
sentence
and
went
back
to
the
perusal
of
the
girl
face
so
this
was
daughter
well
they
had
not
lied
in
one
respect
at
least
she
was
a
winner
for
looks
that
was
plain
to
be
seen
even
from
the
crude
newspaper
reproduction
the
girl
was
pretty
but
what
else
did
she
have
beside
prettiness
that
was
the
question
did
she
have
any
of
the
rest
of
it
laura
wit
her
inimitable
charm
her
fire
her
genius
pshaw
no
of
course
she
had
nature
did
not
make
two
laura
larue
in
one
century
it
was
too
much
to
expect
lord
what
a
woman
and
what
a
future
she
had
had
and
thrown
away
for
love
love
that
was
it
she
could
have
had
love
and
still
kept
on
with
her
career
it
was
marriage
that
had
been
the
catastrophe
the
fatal
blunder
marriage
and
domesticity
for
a
woman
like
that
it
was
asinine
worse
criminal
it
ought
to
have
been
forbidden
by
law
and
the
stubbornness
of
her
after
all
these
years
remembering
max
hempel
could
have
groaned
aloud
every
stage
manager
in
new
york
including
himself
had
been
ready
to
bankrupt
himself
offering
her
what
in
those
days
were
almost
incredible
contracts
to
prevent
her
from
the
suicidal
folly
on
which
she
was
bent
but
to
no
avail
she
had
laughed
at
them
all
laughed
and
quit
the
stage
at
six
and
twenty
and
a
few
years
later
her
beauty
and
genius
were
still
in
death
what
a
waste
what
a
damnation
waste
at
this
point
in
his
animadversions
max
hempel
again
looked
at
the
girl
in
the
newspaper
the
girl
who
was
the
product
of
the
very
marriage
he
had
been
cursing
larue
only
daughter
if
there
had
been
no
marriage
neither
would
there
have
been
this
glorious
radiant
vividly
alive
young
creature
men
called
laura
larue
dead
but
was
she
was
she
not
tremendously
alive
in
the
life
of
her
lovely
young
daughter
was
it
not
he
and
the
other
childless
ones
who
had
treated
matrimony
as
the
one
supreme
mistake
that
would
soon
be
very
much
dead
dead
past
any
resurrection
pshaw
he
was
getting
sentimental
he
was
here
for
sentiment
he
was
here
for
cold
hard
business
he
was
taking
this
confounded
journey
to
witness
an
amateur
performance
of
a
shakespeare
play
when
he
loathed
traveling
in
hot
weather
detested
amateur
performances
of
anything
particularly
of
shakespeare
on
the
millionth
of
a
chance
that
antoinette
holiday
might
be
possessed
of
a
tithe
of
her
mother
talent
and
might
eventually
be
starred
as
the
new
ingénue
he
was
in
need
of
afar
off
so
to
speak
it
was
carol
clay
herself
who
had
warned
him
carol
was
wonderful
would
always
be
wonderful
but
time
passes
there
would
come
a
season
when
the
public
would
begin
to
count
back
and
remember
that
carol
had
been
playing
ingénue
parts
already
for
over
a
decade
there
must
always
be
youth
fresh
flaming
youth
in
the
offing
that
was
the
stage
and
life
as
for
this
antoinette
holiday
girl
he
had
none
too
much
hope
max
hempel
never
hoped
much
on
general
principles
so
far
as
potential
stars
were
concerned
he
had
seen
too
many
of
them
go
off
fizz
bang
into
nothingness
like
rockets
it
was
more
than
likely
he
was
on
a
false
trail
that
people
who
had
seen
the
girl
act
in
amateur
things
had
exaggerated
her
ability
he
trusted
no
judgment
but
his
own
which
was
perhaps
one
of
the
reasons
why
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
living
stage
managers
it
was
more
than
likely
she
had
nothing
but
a
pretty
shallow
little
talent
for
play
acting
and
no
notion
under
the
sun
of
giving
up
society
or
matrimony
or
for
the
devilish
hard
work
of
a
stage
career
very
likely
there
was
some
young
galoot
waiting
even
now
to
whisk
laura
larue
daughter
off
the
stage
before
she
ever
got
on
moreover
there
was
always
her
family
to
cope
with
dyed
in
the
wool
new
englanders
at
that
no
doubt
with
the
heavy
puritan
mortmain
upon
them
narrow
as
a
shoe
string
circumscribed
as
a
duck
pond
walled
in
by
ghastly
respectability
ten
to
one
if
the
girl
had
talent
and
ambition
they
would
smother
these
things
in
her
balk
her
at
every
turn
they
had
regarded
ned
holiday
marriage
to
laura
a
misalliance
he
recalled
there
had
been
quite
a
about
it
at
the
time
good
god
it
had
been
a
misalliance
all
right
but
not
as
they
reckoned
it
it
had
not
been
considered
suitable
for
a
holiday
to
marry
an
actress
probably
it
would
be
considered
more
unsuitable
for
a
holiday
to
an
actress
suitable
bah
the
question
was
not
whether
the
career
was
fit
for
the
girl
but
whether
the
girl
could
measure
up
to
the
career
and
irascibly
unreasonably
indignant
as
if
he
had
already
been
contending
in
argument
with
legions
of
mythical
holidays
max
hempel
whipped
his
paper
open
to
another
page
a
page
that
told
of
a
drive
somewhere
on
the
western
front
that
had
failed
miserably
for
this
was
the
year
nineteen
hundred
and
sixteen
and
there
was
a
war
going
on
on
the
other
side
oh
typically
american
phrase
meanwhile
the
young
man
too
had
stopped
staring
at
antoinette
pictured
face
and
was
staring
out
of
the
window
instead
at
the
fast
flying
landscape
he
had
really
no
need
anyway
to
look
at
a
picture
of
tony
his
head
and
heart
were
full
of
them
he
had
been
storing
them
up
for
over
eight
years
and
it
was
a
considerable
collection
by
now
and
one
in
which
he
took
great
joy
in
lonely
hours
in
his
dingy
little
lodging
room
or
in
odd
moments
as
he
went
his
way
at
his
task
as
a
reporter
for
a
great
new
york
daily
the
perspicuous
reader
will
not
need
to
be
told
that
the
young
man
was
in
love
with
tony
holiday
desperately
in
love
desperately
was
the
word
slight
as
max
hempel
hope
may
have
been
that
laura
larue
daughter
was
to
prove
the
ingénue
he
sought
infinitely
slighter
was
dick
carson
hope
of
ever
making
tony
his
wife
how
could
it
be
otherwise
tony
holiday
was
as
far
above
him
in
his
own
eyes
as
the
top
of
mount
tom
was
high
above
the
onion
beds
of
the
valley
the
very
name
he
used
was
his
only
because
she
had
given
it
to
him
dick
nobody
he
had
been
richard
carson
he
had
become
through
grace
of
tony
like
his
companion
the
young
man
went
back
into
the
past
though
not
so
far
a
journey
as
vividly
as
if
it
were
but
yesterday
he
remembered
the
misery
of
flesh
and
spirit
which
had
been
his
as
he
stowed
himself
away
in
the
hay
loft
in
the
holiday
barn
that
long
ago
summer
dawn
too
sick
to
take
another
step
and
caring
little
whether
he
lived
or
died
conscious
vaguely
however
that
death
would
be
infinitely
preferable
to
going
back
to
the
life
of
the
circus
and
the
man
jim
coarse
brutality
from
which
he
had
made
his
escape
at
last
and
then
he
had
opened
his
eyes
hours
later
and
there
had
been
tony
and
there
had
been
chiefly
tony
ever
since
for
him
if
ever
he
amounted
to
anything
and
he
meant
to
amount
to
something
it
would
be
all
due
to
tony
and
her
uncle
phil
the
two
of
them
had
saved
him
in
more
ways
than
one
had
faith
in
him
when
he
was
much
but
a
scarecrow
ignorant
profane
unmoral
miserable
a
gutter
brat
as
some
one
had
once
called
him
a
phrase
he
had
never
forgotten
it
had
seemed
to
brand
him
set
him
apart
from
people
like
the
holidays
forever
but
tony
and
doctor
phil
had
shown
him
a
different
way
of
looking
at
it
proved
to
him
that
nothing
could
really
disgrace
him
but
himself
they
had
given
him
his
chance
and
he
had
taken
it
please
god
he
would
make
himself
yet
into
something
they
could
be
proud
of
and
it
would
all
be
their
doing
he
would
never
forget
that
whatever
happened
a
half
hour
later
the
train
puffed
and
wheezed
into
the
station
at
northampton
dick
carson
and
max
hempel
still
close
together
descended
into
the
swarming
chattering
crowd
which
was
delightfully
if
confusingly
congested
with
pretty
girls
more
pretty
girls
and
still
more
pretty
girls
but
dick
was
not
confused
even
before
the
train
had
come
to
a
full
stop
he
had
caught
sight
of
tony
he
had
a
single
track
mind
so
far
as
girls
were
concerned
from
the
moment
his
eyes
discovered
tony
holiday
the
rest
simply
did
not
exist
for
him
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
he
knew
they
were
there
at
all
in
spite
of
their
manifest
ubiquity
and
equally
manifest
pulchritude
tony
saw
him
too
as
he
loomed
up
taller
than
the
others
bearing
resistlessly
down
upon
her
she
waved
a
gay
greeting
and
smiled
her
welcome
to
him
through
the
throng
max
hempel
close
behind
caught
the
message
too
and
recognized
the
face
of
the
girl
who
smiled
as
the
original
of
the
newspaper
cut
he
had
just
been
studying
so
assiduously
deliberately
he
dogged
the
young
man
heels
he
wanted
to
get
a
view
of
laura
larue
daughter
she
was
much
prettier
than
the
picture
even
from
a
distance
he
had
made
that
out
as
she
stood
there
among
the
crowd
vivacious
vivid
clad
all
in
white
except
for
the
loose
sweater
which
set
off
her
warm
brunette
beauty
and
the
slim
but
charmingly
rounded
curves
of
her
supple
young
body
yes
she
was
like
laura
like
her
and
yet
different
with
a
quality
which
he
fancied
belonged
to
herself
and
none
other
almost
jealously
hempel
watched
the
meeting
between
the
girl
and
the
youth
who
up
to
now
had
been
negligible
enough
but
suddenly
emerged
into
significance
as
the
possible
young
galoot
already
mentally
warned
off
the
premises
by
the
stage
manager
dick
o
dick
i
glad
to
see
you
cried
the
girl
holding
out
both
hands
to
the
new
arrival
her
cheeks
were
flushed
her
eyes
shining
she
looked
quite
as
glad
as
she
proclaimed
as
for
the
young
man
who
had
set
down
his
suitcase
and
taken
possession
of
both
the
proffered
hands
there
was
the
slightest
doubt
that
he
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
bliss
wherever
that
may
be
next
door
to
paradise
max
hempel
hoped
somewhat
vindictively
just
you
wait
young
man
he
muttered
to
himself
bet
you
have
to
anyway
that
glorious
young
thing
is
going
to
settle
down
to
the
shallows
of
matrimony
without
trying
the
deep
waters
first
unless
mightily
mistaken
in
the
meantime
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
and
the
man
of
power
trudged
away
in
the
direction
of
a
taxicab
leaving
youth
alone
with
itself
everybody
is
here
bubbled
tony
at
least
nearly
everybody
larry
went
to
a
horrid
old
medical
convention
at
chicago
and
ca
be
here
for
the
play
but
he
coming
to
commencement
of
course
granny
is
able
to
travel
and
aunt
margery
could
come
because
the
kiddies
have
been
measling
but
ted
is
here
and
uncle
phil
bless
him
he
brought
the
twins
over
from
dunbury
in
the
car
phil
lambert
and
everybody
are
waiting
down
the
street
carlotta
too
to
think
you
have
ever
met
her
when
she
been
my
roommate
and
best
friend
for
two
years
and
oh
dicky
i
have
seen
you
myself
for
most
a
year
and
i
so
glad
she
beamed
up
at
him
as
she
made
this
rather
ambiguous
statement
and
you
have
said
a
word
but
just
are
you
glad
to
see
me
dicky
she
reproached
he
grunted
at
that
about
a
thousand
times
gladder
than
if
i
were
in
heaven
unless
you
happened
to
be
sitting
beside
me
on
the
golden
stairs
and
if
you
think
i
do
know
how
long
it
is
since
i
seen
you
you
are
mightily
mistaken
it
is
precisely
one
million
years
in
round
numbers
oh
it
is
tony
smiled
appeased
why
did
you
say
so
before
and
not
leave
me
to
squeeze
it
out
of
you
like
dick
grinned
back
happily
because
you
brought
me
up
not
to
interrupt
a
lady
you
seemed
to
have
the
floor
so
to
speak
so
to
speak
indeed
laughed
tony
carlotta
says
i
exist
for
that
sole
purpose
but
come
on
everybody
crazy
to
see
you
and
i
a
million
things
to
do
and
tucking
her
arm
in
his
tony
marshaled
the
procession
of
two
down
the
stairs
to
the
street
where
the
car
and
the
old
holiday

the

of

and

are
related
in

on

first
of

there
was
the
owner
of

philip
holiday
himself
a
married
man
now
with
a
small
son
and
daughter
of
his

of

and
thinner
of

was
the
doctor
but
possessed
of
the
same
genial
friendliness
of
manner
and
whimsical
humor
the
same
steady
hand
held
out
to
help
wherever
and
whenever
help
was
needed
he
was
head
of
the
house
of
holiday
now
for
his
father
the
saintly
old
pastor
had
gone
on
to
other
fields
and
his
soldier
brother
ned
tony
father
had
also
gone
in
the
prime
of
life
two
years
before
victim
of
typhus
leaving
his
beloved
little
daughter
and
his
two
sons
just
verging
into
manhood
in
the
care
of
the
younger
holiday
as
dick
and
the
doctor
exchanged
cordial
greetings
the
latter
friendly
eyes
challenged
the
young
man
and
were
answered
plainly
as
if
words
had
been
spoken
the
doctor
knew
that
dick
was
keeping
faith
with
the
old
pact
living
up
to
the
name
the
little
girl
tony
had
given
him
in
her
impulsive
generosity
something
not
quite
right
though
he
thought
the
boy
is
all
happy
wonder
what
the
trouble
is
probably
a
girl
usually
is
at
that
age
at
the
wheel
beside
the
doctor
was
his
namesake
and
neighbor
philip
lambert
phil
was
graduating
himself
this
year
from
the
college
across
the
river
a
sturdy
athlete
of
some
note
and
a
phi
beta
kappa
man
as
well
out
of
a
willful
boyhood
he
had
emerged
into
a
finely
tempered
steady
young
manhood
the
dunbury
wiseacres
who
had
been
wont
to
shake
their
heads
over
phil
youthful
escapades
and
prophesy
a
bad
end
for
such
a
youngster
now
patted
themselves
complacently
on
the
back
as
wiseacres
will
and
declared
they
had
always
known
the
boy
would
turn
out
a
credit
to
his
family
and
the
town
on
the
back
seat
were
phil
sisters
the
pretty
twins
charley
and
clare
still
astonishingly
alike
at
twenty
as
they
had
been
at
twelve
and
still
full
of
the
high
spirits
and
ready
laughter
and
wit
that
had
made
them
the
life
of
the
hill
in
the
old
days
neither
looked
a
day
over
sixteen
but
clare
had
already
been
teaching
two
years
in
a
dunbury
public
school
and
charley
was
to
go
into
nurse
training
in
the
fall
larry
the
young
doctor
as
dunbury
had
taken
to
calling
him
in
distinction
from
his
uncle
was
not
yet
arrived
as
tony
had
explained
but
ted
her
younger
brother
was
very
much
on
the
scene
arrayed
in
all
the
extravagant
niceties
of
modish
attire
affected
by
university
undergraduates
at
twenty
ted
holiday
was
as
handsome
as
the
traditional
young
greek
god
and
possessed
of
a
godlike
propensity
to
do
as
he
liked
and
the
devil
take
the
consequences
already
ned
holiday
younger
son
had
acquired
something
of
a
reputation
as
a
high
flier
among
his
own
sex
and
a
heart
breaker
among
the
fairer
one
reckless
debonair
utterly
irresponsible
he
was
still
terrible
teddy
as
his
father
had
jocosely
dubbed
him
long
ago
yet
he
was
quite
as
lovable
as
he
was
irrepressible
and
had
a
manifest
grace
to
counterbalance
every
one
of
his
many
faults
his
soberer
brother
larry
worried
uselessly
over
ted
misdeeds
and
took
him
sharply
to
task
for
them
but
even
larry
admitted
that
there
was
something
rather
magnificent
about
ted
and
that
possibly
in
the
end
he
would
come
out
the
soundest
holiday
of
them
all
there
remains
only
carlotta
to
be
introduced
carlotta
was
lovely
to
look
upon
a
poet
speaks
somewhere
of
a
face
made
out
of
a
rose
carlotta
had
that
kind
of
a
face
and
her
eyes
were
of
that
deep
violet
shade
which
works
mischief
and
magic
in
the
hearts
of
men
as
for
her
hair
it
might
well
have
been
the
envy
of
any
princess
in
or
out
of
the
covers
of
a
book
so
fine
spun
was
it
in
texture
so
pure
gold
in
color
like
the
warm
vivid
shimmer
of
tropical
sunshine
she
lifted
an
inquiring
gaze
now
to
dick
as
she
held
out
her
hand
in
acknowledgment
of
the
introduction
and
dick
murmured
something
platitudinous
bowed
politely
over
the
hand
and
never
noticed
what
color
her
eyes
were
a
single
track
mind
is
both
a
curse
and
a
protection
to
a
man
carlotta
come
tony
was
explaining
gaily
though
i
told
her
there
was
room
let
me
inform
you
all
that
carlotta
is
the
most
completely
magnificently
delightfully
spoiled
young
person
in
these
united
states
of
america
barring
you
teased
her
uncle
barring
none
by
comparison
with
carlotta
i
am
all
the
noble
army
of
saints
martyrs
and
seraphim
on
record
combined
carlotta
is
preordained
to
have
her
own
way
everybody
unites
to
give
it
to
her
we
ca
help
it
she
hypnotizes
us
some
night
you
will
miss
the
moon
in
its
accustomed
place
and
you
will
find
that
she
wanted
it
for
a
few
moments
to
play
with
philip
lambert
had
turned
around
in
his
seat
and
was
surveying
carlotta
rather
curiously
during
this
teasing
tirade
of
tony
oh
well
murmured
carlotta
your
old
moon
can
be
put
up
again
when
i
am
through
with
it
i
sha
do
it
a
bit
of
harm
anyway
carson
must
not
be
told
such
horrid
things
about
me
the
very
first
time
he
meets
me
must
he
phil
he
might
think
they
were
true
she
suddenly
lifted
her
eyes
and
smiled
straight
up
into
the
face
of
the
young
man
on
the
front
seat
who
was
watching
her
so
intently
well
are
they
returned
the
young
man
addressed
stooping
to
examine
the
brake
carlotta
did
not
appear
in
the
least
offended
at
his
curt
comment
indeed
the
smile
on
her
lips
lingered
as
if
it
had
some
inner
reason
for
being
there
hop
in
tony
ordered
ted
with
brotherly
peremptoriness
carlotta
you
are
one
too
many
my
love
you
will
have
to
sit
in
my
lap
i
getting
out
said
phil
i
due
across
the
river
want
ted
to
take
the
wheel
doctor
i
do
not
i
have
a
wife
and
children
at
home
i
can
not
afford
to
place
my
life
in
jeopardy
the
doctor
eyes
twinkled
as
they
rested
a
moment
on
his
youngest
nephew
now
uncle
phil
that
mean
of
you
you
ought
to
see
me
drive
i
have
commented
holiday
drily
come
on
over
here
one
of
you
twinnies
if
phil
must
go
see
you
my
boy
he
turned
to
his
namesake
to
ask
as
charley
accepted
the
invitation
and
clambered
over
the
back
of
the
seat
while
the
doctor
took
her
brother
vacated
post
phil
shook
his
head
no
i
was
in
on
the
dress
rehearsal
last
night
i
had
my
share
but
you
folks
are
going
to
see
the
jolliest
rosalind
that
ever
grew
in
arden
or
out
of
it
that
one
sure
thing
phil
smiled
at
tony
as
he
spoke
and
dick
settling
himself
in
the
small
seat
beside
ted
felt
a
small
barbed
dart
of
jealousy
prick
into
him
tony
and
phil
were
obviously
exceedingly
good
friends
they
had
he
knew
seen
much
of
each
other
during
the
past
four
years
with
only
a
river
between
phil
was
tony
own
kind
with
a
certified
line
of
good
old
new
england
ancestry
behind
him
moreover
he
was
a
darned
fine
fellow
one
of
the
best
in
fact
in
spite
of
that
hateful
little
jabbing
dart
dick
acknowledged
that
ah
well
there
was
more
than
a
river
between
himself
and
tony
holiday
and
there
always
would
be
who
was
he
nameless
as
he
was
to
enter
the
lists
against
philip
lambert
or
any
one
else
the
car
sped
away
leaving
phil
standing
bareheaded
in
the
sunshine
staring
after
it
the
mocking
silver
lilt
of
carlotta
cressy
laughter
drifted
back
to
him
he
shrugged
jammed
on
his
hat
and
strode
off
in
the
direction
of
the
trolley
car
dick
carson
might
just
as
well
have
spared
himself
the
pain
of
jealousy
phil
had
already
forgotten
tony
was
remembering
only
carlotta
who
would
never
deliberately
do
a
mite
of
harm
to
the
moon
would
merely
want
to
play
with
it
at
her
fancy
and
leave
it
at
her
whim
for
somebody
else
to
replace
if
anybody
cared
to
take
the
pains
and
what
was
a
moon
more
or
less
anyway
chapter
ii
with
rosalind
in
arden
of
course
it
is
understood
that
every
graduating
class
rightfully
asserts
and
is
backed
up
in
its
belief
by
doting
and
nobly
partisan
relatives
and
blindly
devoted
hyperbolic
friends
that
particular
unique
and
proper
senior
dramatics
is
the
most
glorious
and
unforgettable
performance
in
all
the
histrionic
annals
of
the
college
a
thing
to
make
will
shakespeare
himself
rise
and
applaud
from
his
high
and
far
off
hills
of
paradise
certainly
tony
class
knew
past
any
qualms
of
doubt
and
made
no
bones
of
proclaiming
its
conviction
that
there
never
had
been
such
a
wonderful
as
you
like
it
and
that
never
so
long
as
the
stars
kept
their
seats
in
the
heavens
and
senior
classes
produced
shakespeare
two
practically
synonymous
conditions
would
there
ever
be
such
another
rosalind
as
tony
holiday
so
fresh
so
spontaneous
so
happy
in
her
acting
so
bewitchingly
winsome
to
behold
so
boyish
yet
so
exquisitely
feminine
in
her
doublet
and
hose
so
daring
so
dainty
so
full
of
wit
and
grace
and
sparkle
so
tender
so
merry
so
natural
so
and
utterly
as
will
himself
would
have
liked
his
right
rosalind
to
be
so
the
class
maintained
and
so
they
chanted
soon
and
late
in
many
keys
with
a
hey
and
a
ho
and
a
hey
nonino
and
who
so
bold
or
malicious
or
age
cankered
as
to
dispute
the
dictum
is
it
not
youth
privilege
to
fling
enthusiasm
and
superlatives
to
the
wind
and
to
deal
in
glorious
arrogance
it
must
be
admitted
however
in
due
justice
that
the
class
that
played
as
you
like
it
that
year
had
some
grounds
on
which
to
base
its
pretensions
and
for
had
not
a
great
stage
manager
been
present
and
applauded
until
his
palms
were
purple
and
perspiration
beaded
his
beak
of
a
nose
had
he
not
as
the
last
curtain
descended
blown
his
nose
mopped
his
brow
exclaimed
god
bless
my
soul
three
times
in
succession
and
demanded
to
be
shown
without
delay
into
the
presence
of
rosalind
as
we
know
already
the
great
stage
manager
had
not
come
or
to
northampton
to
see
tony
holiday
play
rosalind
indeed
when
it
had
been
first
suggested
that
he
do
so
he
had
objected
violently
and
remarked
with
conviction
that
he
would
be
da
er
if
he
would
but
he
had
come
and
he
had
been
blessed
involuntarily
for
he
had
seen
something
he
had
not
expected
to
see
a
real
play
with
real
magic
to
it
such
magic
as
all
his
cunning
stage
artifice
all
the
studied
artistry
of
his
fearfully
and
wonderfully
salaried
stellar
attachments
somehow
missed
achieving
he
tried
afterwards
to
explain
to
carol
clay
his
favorite
star
just
what
the
quality
of
the
magic
was
but
somehow
he
could
not
get
it
into
words
it
was
exactly
wordable
perhaps
it
was
something
that
rendered
negligible
the
occasionally
creaking
mechanism
and
crudeness
of
stage
business
and
rendition
something
compounded
of
dew
and
sun
and
wind
such
as
could
only
be
found
in
a
veritable
forest
of
arden
something
elusive
exquisite
iridescent
something
he
had
supposed
had
vanished
from
the
world
about
the
time
they
put
pan
out
of
business
and
stopped
up
the
pipes
of
arcady
it
was
enchanting
elemental
genuine
elizabethan
had
the
spirit
of
master
skylark
himself
in
it
maybe
it
was
the
spirit
of
youth
itself
immortal
youth
playing
immortal
youth
supreme
play
who
knows
or
can
lay
finger
upon
the
secret
of
the
magic
the
great
stage
manager
did
not
and
could
not
he
only
knew
that
in
spite
of
himself
he
had
drunk
deep
for
a
moment
of
true
elixir
but
as
for
rosalind
herself
that
was
another
matter
max
hempel
was
entirely
capable
of
analyzing
his
impressions
there
and
correlating
them
with
the
cold
hard
business
on
which
he
had
come
even
if
the
play
had
proved
a
greater
bore
than
he
had
anticipated
the
trip
from
broadway
to
the
academy
of
music
would
still
have
been
materially
worth
while
antoinette
holiday
was
a
genuine
find
authentic
star
stuff
they
spoiled
her
plastered
her
over
with
meaningless
mannerisms
she
was
virgin
material
untrained
with
worlds
to
learn
of
course
but
with
a
spark
of
the
true
fire
in
her
her
mother
own
daughter
which
was
the
most
promising
thing
anybody
could
say
of
her
no
wonder
max
hempel
had
peremptorily
demanded
to
be
shown
behind
the
scenes
without
an
instant
delay
he
was
almost
in
a
panic
lest
some
other
manager
should
likewise
have
gotten
wind
of
this
rosalind
and
be
lurking
in
the
wings
even
now
to
pounce
upon
his
own
legitimate
prey
he
could
quite
forget
either
the
tall
young
man
of
the
encounter
his
seatmate
up
from
springfield
he
was
exactly
afraid
however
having
seen
the
girl
and
watched
her
live
rosalind
the
child
had
wings
and
would
want
to
fly
far
and
free
with
them
unless
he
was
mightily
mistaken
in
his
reading
of
her
tony
was
still
resplendent
in
her
wedding
white
and
with
her
arms
full
of
roses
when
she
obeyed
the
summons
to
the
stage
door
on
being
told
that
the
great
manager
wished
to
see
her
she
came
toward
him
flushed
excited
adorably
pretty
she
laid
down
her
roses
and
held
out
her
hand
shy
but
perfectly
this
is
the
forest
of
arden
she
quoted
it
must
be
or
else
i
am
dreaming
as
long
as
i
can
remember
i
have
wanted
to
meet
you
and
here
you
are
right
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
he
bowed
low
over
her
hand
and
raised
it
gallantly
to
his
lips
i
rather
think
i
am
still
in
arden
myself
he
said
my
dear
you
have
given
me
a
treat
such
as
i
never
expected
to
enjoy
again
in
this
world
you
made
me
forget
i
knew
anything
about
plays
or
was
seeing
one
you
carried
me
off
with
you
to
arden
did
you
really
like
the
play
begged
tony
at
the
praise
of
the
great
man
i
liked
it
amazingly
and
i
liked
your
playing
even
more
amazingly
is
it
true
that
you
are
going
on
the
stage
he
had
dropped
arden
now
gotten
down
to
what
he
would
have
called
brass
tacks
the
difference
was
in
his
voice
tony
sensed
it
vaguely
and
was
suddenly
a
little
frightened
why
i
i
do
know
she
faltered
i
hope
so
sometime
sometime
is
never
he
snapped
that
wo
do
the
arden
magic
was
quite
gone
by
this
time
he
was
scowling
a
little
and
thrust
out
his
upper
lip
in
a
way
tony
did
not
care
for
at
all
it
occurred
to
her
inconsequentially
that
he
looked
a
good
deal
like
the
wolf
in
the
story
who
threatened
to
huff
and
puff
until
he
blew
in
the
house
of
the
little
pigs
she
did
want
her
house
blown
in
she
wished
uncle
phil
would
come
she
stooped
to
gather
up
her
roses
as
if
they
might
serve
as
a
barricade
between
her
and
the
wolf
but
suddenly
she
forgot
her
misgivings
again
for
max
hempel
was
saying
incredible
things
things
which
set
her
imagination
agog
and
her
pulses
leaping
he
was
offering
her
a
small
role
a
maid
part
in
one
of
his
road
companies
me
she
gasped
from
behind
her
roses
you
when
the
day
after
next
week
at
the
latest
chances
like
that
do
go
begging
long
young
lady
will
you
take
it
oh
i
wish
i
could
sighed
tony
but
i
am
afraid
i
ca
oh
there
is
uncle
phil
she
interrupted
herself
to
exclaim
with
perceptible
relief
in
a
moment
doctor
holiday
was
with
them
his
arm
around
tony
while
he
acknowledged
the
introduction
to
the
stage
manager
who
eyed
him
somewhat
uncordially
the
two
men
took
each
the
other
measure
possibly
a
spark
of
antagonism
flashed
between
them
for
an
instant
each
wanted
the
lovely
little
rosalind
on
his
own
side
of
the
fence
and
each
suspected
the
other
of
desiring
to
lure
her
to
the
other
side
if
he
could
for
the
moment
however
the
advantage
was
all
with
the
doctor
with
his
protecting
arm
around
tony
holiday
muttered
hempel
there
was
a
holiday
once
who
married
one
of
the
finest
actresses
of
the
american
stage
carried
her
off
to
nurse
his
babies
i
never
forgave
that
man
he
was
a
brute
tony
stiffened
her
eyes
flashed
she
drew
away
from
her
uncle
and
confronted
the
stage
manager
angrily
he
was
a
brute
if
you
mean
my
father
she
burst
out
my
mother
was
laura
larue
i
know
it
grinned
the
manager
thoroughly
delighted
to
have
struck
fire
the
girl
was
better
even
than
he
had
thought
she
was
magnificent
angry
that
why
i
here
he
added
i
just
offered
this
young
person
a
part
in
a
practically
cast
touring
the
west
do
you
mind
he
challenged
doctor
holiday
i
should
mind
her
accepting
said
the
other
man
tranquilly
as
it
is
i
am
duly
appreciative
of
the
offer
thank
you
what
if
i
told
you
she
had
accepted
the
wolf
snapped
tony
saw
the
swift
shadow
cloud
her
uncle
face
and
hated
the
manager
for
hurting
him
like
that
i
did
she
protested
indignantly
you
know
i
would
promise
anything
without
talking
to
you
uncle
phil
i
told
him
i
could
go
but
you
wanted
to
persisted
the
wolf
bound
to
get
his
fangs
in
somewhere
tony
smiled
a
little
wistfully
i
wanted
to
most
awfully
she
confessed
patting
her
uncle
arm
to
take
the
sting
out
of
her
admission
will
you
ask
me
again
some
day
she
appealed
to
the
manager
he
snorted
at
that
you
come
asking
me
young
lady
and
before
long
too
laura
daughter
is
going
to
settle
down
to
being
either
a
butterfly
or
a
you
are
going
on
the
stage
and
you
know
it
no
use
holiday
you
wo
be
able
to
hold
her
back
it
in
the
blood
you
may
be
able
to
dam
the
tide
for
a
time
but
not
forever
i
do
intend
to
dam
it
said
the
doctor
gravely
if
when
the
time
comes
tony
wishes
to
go
on
the
stage
i
shall
not
try
to
prevent
her
in
fact
i
shall
help
her
in
every
way
in
my
power
uncle
phil
tony
voice
had
a
tiny
catch
in
it
she
knew
her
grandmother
would
be
bitterly
opposed
to
her
going
on
the
stage
and
had
imagined
she
would
have
to
win
even
her
uncle
over
by
slow
degrees
to
the
gratifying
of
this
desire
of
her
heart
it
had
hurt
her
even
to
think
of
hurting
him
or
going
against
him
in
any
way
he
who
was
father
and
mother
and
a
to
her
dear
uncle
phil
how
he
always
understood
and
took
the
big
broad
viewpoint
the
manager
grunted
approval
at
that
his
belligerency
waned
congratulate
you
sir
that
spoken
like
a
man
of
sense
evidently
you
are
able
to
see
over
the
wall
farther
than
most
of
the
new
englanders
i
met
i
should
like
the
chance
to
launch
this
rosalind
of
yours
but
do
make
it
too
far
off
youth
is
the
biggest
drawing
card
in
the
world
and
the
most
transient
you
have
to
get
in
the
game
early
to
get
away
with
it
i
start
her
whenever
you
say
next
week
next
month
next
year
guarantee
to
have
her
ready
to
understudy
a
star
in
three
months
and
perhaps
a
star
herself
in
six
she
might
jump
into
the
heavens
overnight
stranger
things
have
happened
what
do
you
say
may
i
have
an
option
on
the
young
lady
that
is
rather
too
big
a
question
to
settle
off
hand
at
midnight
tony
is
barely
and
she
has
home
obligations
which
will
have
to
be
considered
her
grandmother
is
old
and
frail
and
a
new
englander
of
the
old
school
too
bad
commiserated
the
manager
but
never
mind
all
that
all
i
ask
is
that
you
wo
let
her
sign
up
with
anybody
else
without
giving
me
a
chance
first
i
think
we
may
safely
promise
that
and
thank
you
tony
and
i
both
appreciate
that
you
are
doing
her
a
good
deal
of
honor
for
one
small
school
girl
eh
tony
the
doctor
smiled
down
at
his
flushed
niece
he
understood
precisely
what
a
big
moment
it
was
for
her
oh
i
should
think
so
sighed
tony
you
are
awfully
kind
hempel
it
is
like
a
wonderful
dream
almost
too
good
to
be
true
both
men
smiled
at
that
for
youth
no
dream
is
quite
too
extravagant
or
incredible
to
be
potentially
true
no
grim
specters
of
failure
and
disillusionment
and
frustration
dog
its
bright
path
all
possibilities
are
its
divine
inheritance
hempel
did
you
know
my
mother
tony
asked
suddenly
with
a
shadow
of
wistfulness
in
her
dark
eyes
there
were
so
few
people
whom
she
met
that
had
known
her
mother
it
was
as
if
laura
larue
had
moved
in
a
different
orbit
from
that
of
her
daughter
it
always
hurt
tony
to
feel
that
but
here
was
one
who
was
of
her
mother
own
world
no
wonder
her
eyes
were
beseeching
as
they
sought
the
great
manager
he
bowed
gravely
i
knew
her
very
well
she
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
women
i
have
ever
seen
and
one
of
the
greatest
actresses
your
father
was
a
lucky
man
my
dear
few
women
would
have
given
up
for
any
man
what
she
gave
up
for
him
oh
but
she
loved
him
explained
laura
larue
daughter
simply
again
hempel
nodded
she
did
he
admitted
grimly
after
all
these
years
there
was
no
use
admitting
that
that
had
been
the
deepest
rub
of
all
that
laura
had
loved
ned
holiday
and
had
never
for
even
the
span
of
a
moment
thought
of
caring
for
himself
i
repeat
your
father
was
a
very
lucky
man
a
damnably
lucky
one
and
with
that
they
shook
hands
and
parted
it
was
many
months
before
tony
was
to
see
max
hempel
again
and
many
waters
were
to
run
under
the
bridge
before
the
meeting
came
to
pass
outside
in
the
car
ted
dick
and
the
twins
waited
the
arrival
of
the
heroine
of
the
evening
the
three
latter
greeted
her
with
a
burst
of
prideful
congratulation
the
former
being
merely
a
brother
was
distinctly
cross
at
having
been
kept
waiting
so
long
and
did
not
hesitate
to
express
his
sentiments
fully
out
loud
but
doctor
holiday
cut
short
his
nephew
somewhat
ungracious
speech
by
a
quiet
reminder
that
the
car
was
here
primarily
for
tony
use
and
the
boy
subsided
having
no
more
to
say
until
having
deposited
the
occupants
of
the
car
at
their
various
destinations
he
announced
to
his
uncle
with
elaborate
carelessness
that
he
would
take
the
car
around
to
the
garage
but
he
did
not
turn
in
at
the
side
street
where
the
garage
was
instead
he
shot
out
elm
street
hitting
her
up
at
forty
there
had
been
a
reason
for
his
impatience
ted
holiday
had
important
private
business
to
transact
ere
cock
crow
tony
lay
awake
a
long
time
that
night
dreaming
dreams
that
carried
her
far
and
far
into
the
future
until
rosalind
happy
triumph
of
the
evening
almost
faded
away
in
the
glory
of
the
it
was
characteristic
of
the
girl
stage
of
development
that
in
all
her
dreams
no
lovers
much
less
a
possible
husband
ever
once
entered
tony
holiday
was
in
love
with
life
and
life
alone
that
wonderful
june
night
as
hempel
had
shrewdly
perceived
she
was
conscious
of
having
wings
and
desirous
of
flying
far
and
free
with
them
ere
she
came
to
pause
she
did
remember
in
passing
however
how
she
had
caught
dick
eyes
once
as
he
sat
in
the
box
near
the
stage
and
how
his
rapt
gaze
had
thrilled
her
to
intenser
playing
of
her
part
and
she
remembered
how
dear
he
was
afterward
in
the
car
when
he
held
her
roses
and
told
her
softly
what
a
wonderful
wonderful
rosalind
she
was
but
on
the
whole
dick
like
most
of
the
rest
of
the
people
with
whom
she
had
held
converse
since
the
curtain
went
down
upon
arden
seemed
unimportant
and
indistinct
like
courtiers
and
foresters
not
specifically
named
among
the
just
put
in
to
fill
out
and
make
a
more
effective
stage
setting
dick
too
in
his
room
on
greene
street
was
wakeful
he
sat
by
the
window
far
into
the
night
his
heart
was
heavy
within
him
the
gulf
between
him
and
tony
had
suddenly
widened
immeasureably
she
was
a
real
actress
he
had
needed
a
great
manager
verdict
to
teach
him
that
he
had
seen
it
with
his
own
eyes
heard
it
with
his
own
ears
felt
it
with
his
own
heart
he
had
worshiped
and
adored
and
been
made
unutterably
sad
and
lonely
by
her
dazzling
success
glad
as
he
was
that
it
had
come
to
her
tony
would
go
on
in
her
shining
path
he
would
always
lag
behind
in
the
shadows
they
would
never
come
together
as
long
as
they
both
lived
she
had
started
too
far
ahead
he
could
never
overtake
her
if
only
there
were
some
way
of
finding
out
who
he
was
get
some
clue
as
to
his
parentage
he
only
knew
that
the
man
they
called
jim
who
had
kicked
and
beaten
and
sworn
at
him
with
foul
oaths
until
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
was
no
kin
of
his
though
the
other
had
claimed
the
authority
to
abuse
him
as
he
abused
his
horses
and
dogs
when
drink
and
ugliness
were
upon
him
if
only
he
could
find
jim
again
after
all
these
years
perhaps
he
could
manage
to
get
the
truth
out
of
him
find
out
what
the
man
knew
of
himself
and
how
he
had
come
to
be
in
a
circus
troupe
yet
after
all
perhaps
it
was
better
not
to
know
the
facts
might
separate
him
from
tony
even
more
than
he
was
separated
by
his
ignorance
of
them
as
it
was
he
started
even
with
neither
honor
nor
shame
bequeathed
him
from
the
past
what
he
was
he
was
in
himself
and
if
by
any
miracle
of
fortune
tony
ever
did
come
to
care
for
him
it
would
be
just
himself
plain
dick
that
she
would
love
he
knew
that
the
thought
was
vaguely
comforting
and
he
too
fell
adreaming
most
of
us
foiled
humans
learn
to
play
the
game
of
and
to
find
such
consolation
as
we
may
therein
often
and
often
in
his
lonely
hours
dick
carson
had
summoned
tony
holiday
to
his
side
a
tony
as
bright
and
beautiful
and
all
adorable
as
the
real
tony
but
a
dream
tony
withal
a
tony
who
loved
him
even
as
he
loved
her
and
in
his
he
was
no
longer
a
nameless
impecunious
cub
reporter
but
a
man
who
had
arrived
somewhere
made
himself
worthy
so
far
as
any
mere
man
could
of
the
supreme
gift
of
tony
caring
too
dick
played
the
game
determinedly
but
somehow
he
found
its
consolation
rather
meager
as
cold
and
remote
as
the
sparkle
of
the
june
stars
millions
of
miles
away
up
there
in
the
velvet
sky
after
having
sat
by
the
side
of
the
living
breathing
tony
and
looking
into
her
happy
eyes
known
how
little
how
very
little
he
was
in
her
thoughts
she
liked
him
to
be
near
her
he
knew
just
as
she
liked
her
roses
to
be
fragrant
but
neither
the
roses
nor
himself
was
a
vital
necessity
to
her
she
could
do
very
well
without
either
that
was
the
pity
of
it
at
last
he
got
up
and
went
to
bed
falling
into
troubled
sleep
he
dreamed
that
he
and
tony
were
wandering
hand
in
hand
in
the
forest
of
arden
from
afar
off
came
the
sound
of
music
airy
voices
chanting
when
birds
do
sing
hey
ding
a
ding
sweet
lovers
love
the
spring
and
then
somebody
laughed
mockingly
like
jacques
and
somebody
else
clad
in
motley
like
touchstone
but
who
seemed
to
speak
in
dick
own
voice
murmured
ay
now
am
i
in
arden
the
more
fool
i
and
even
with
these
words
the
forest
vanished
and
tony
with
it
and
the
dreamer
was
left
alone
on
a
steep
and
dusty
road
lost
and
aching
for
the
missing
touch
of
her
hand
but
later
he
woke
to
the
song
of
a
thousand
birds
greeting
the
new
day
with
joy
and
his
heart
too
began
to
sing
for
it
was
indeed
a
new
day
a
day
in
which
he
should
see
tony
he
was
irrationally
content
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
lad
love
chapter
iii
a
girl
who
could
stop
being
a
princess
in
the
lee
of
a
huge
gray
bowlder
on
the
summit
of
mount
tom
sat
philip
lambert
and
carlotta
cressy
below
them
stretched
the
wide
sweep
of
the
river
valley
amethyst
and
topaz
and
emerald
rich
with
lush
june
verdure
soft
shadowed
tranquil
in
the
late
afternoon
sunshine
they
had
been
silent
for
a
little
time
but
suddenly
carlotta
broke
the
silence
phil
do
you
know
why
i
brought
you
up
here
she
asked
as
she
spoke
she
drew
a
little
closer
to
him
and
her
hand
touched
his
as
softly
as
a
drifting
feather
or
a
blown
cherry
blossom
might
have
touched
it
he
turned
to
look
at
her
she
was
all
in
white
like
a
lily
and
otherwise
carried
out
the
lily
tradition
of
belonging
obviously
to
the
species
justifying
the
arrangement
by
looking
seraphically
lovely
in
the
fruits
of
the
loom
and
labor
of
the
rest
of
the
world
and
after
all
sheer
loveliness
is
an
end
in
itself
nobody
expects
a
flower
to
give
account
of
itself
and
carlotta
was
very
very
lovely
as
she
leaned
against
the
granite
rock
with
the
valley
at
her
feet
so
phil
lambert
eyes
told
her
eloquently
the
valley
was
not
the
only
thing
at
carlotta
feet
i
labored
under
the
impression
that
i
did
the
bringing
up
myself
he
remarked
his
hand
closing
over
hers
however
the
point
is
immaterial
you
are
here
and
i
am
here
is
there
a
cosmic
reason
there
is
carlotta
voice
was
dreamy
she
watched
a
cloud
shadow
creep
over
the
mountain
opposite
i
brought
you
up
here
so
that
you
could
propose
to
me
suitably
and
without
interruption
huh
ejaculated
phil
inelegantly
utterly
taken
by
surprise
by
carlotta
announcement
do
you
mind
repeating
that
the
altitude
seems
to
have
affected
my
hearing
you
heard
correctly
i
said
i
brought
you
up
here
to
propose
to
me
phil
shrugged
too
much
you
like
it
he
observed
these
shakespearean
heroines
are
a
bad
lot
may
i
ask
just
why
you
want
me
to
propose
to
you
my
dear
do
you
have
to
collect
a
certain
number
of
scalps
by
this
particular
rare
day
in
june
or
is
it
that
you
think
you
would
enjoy
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
seeing
me
writhe
and
wriggle
when
you
refuse
me
phil
tone
was
carefully
light
and
he
smiled
as
he
asked
the
questions
but
there
was
a
tight
drawn
line
about
his
mouth
even
as
he
smiled
through
bush
through
briar
through
flood
through
fire
he
had
followed
the
will
o
the
wisp
carlotta
for
two
years
now
against
his
better
judgment
and
to
the
undoing
of
his
peace
of
mind
and
heart
and
play
days
were
over
for
phil
lambert
the
world
awaited
him
a
world
where
there
would
be
neither
space
nor
time
for
chasing
phantoms
however
lovely
and
alluring
do
be
horrid
phil
i
not
like
that
you
know
i
not
denied
carlotta
reproachfully
i
have
a
surprise
for
you
philip
my
dear
i
am
going
to
accept
you
no
exclaimed
phil
in
unfeigned
amazement
yes
declared
carlotta
firmly
i
decided
it
in
church
this
morning
when
the
man
was
telling
us
how
fearfully
real
and
earnest
life
is
not
that
i
believe
in
the
i
do
it
bosh
life
was
made
to
be
happy
in
and
that
is
why
i
made
up
my
mind
to
marry
you
you
might
manage
to
look
a
little
bit
pleased
anybody
would
think
you
were
about
to
keep
an
appointment
with
a
dentist
instead
of
having
the
inestimable
privilege
of
proposing
to
me
with
the
inside
information
that
i
am
going
to
accept
you
phil
drew
away
his
hand
from
hers
his
blue
eyes
were
grave
do
carlotta
i
am
afraid
the
chap
was
right
about
the
it
may
be
a
fine
jest
to
you
it
is
to
me
you
see
i
happen
to
be
in
love
with
you
of
course
murmured
carlotta
that
is
quite
understood
did
you
think
i
would
have
bothered
to
drag
you
clear
up
on
a
mountain
top
to
propose
to
me
if
i
had
known
you
were
in
love
with
me
and
i
with
you
she
added
softly
carlotta
do
you
mean
it
phil
whole
heart
was
in
his
honest
blue
eyes
of
course
i
mean
it
foolish
did
you
know
would
i
have
tormented
you
so
all
these
months
if
i
had
cared
but
carlotta
sweetheart
i
ca
believe
you
are
in
earnest
even
now
would
you
marry
me
really
i
i
is
the
verb
i
brought
you
up
here
to
use
mind
your
grammar
phil
clasped
his
hands
behind
him
for
safe
keeping
but
i
ca
ask
you
to
marry
me
at
least
not
carlotta
made
a
dainty
little
face
at
him
and
why
not
have
you
any
religious
scruples
about
proposing
on
sunday
he
grinned
and
involuntarily
at
that
but
he
shook
his
head
and
his
hands
stayed
behind
his
back
i
ca
propose
to
you
because
i
have
a
red
cent
in
the
world
at
least
not
more
than
three
red
cents
i
could
support
an
everyday
wife
on
not
to
mention
a
fairy
princess
as
if
that
mattered
dismissed
carlotta
airily
you
are
in
love
with
me
are
you
lord
help
me
groaned
phil
you
know
i
am
and
i
am
in
love
with
you
for
the
present
you
had
better
ask
me
while
the
asking
is
good
the
wind
may
veer
by
next
week
or
even
by
tomorrow
there
are
other
young
men
who
do
not
require
to
be
commanded
to
propose
they
spurt
automatically
and
often
like
old
faithful
phil
ingenuous
face
clouded
over
the
other
young
men
were
no
fabrication
as
he
knew
to
his
sorrow
he
was
forever
stumbling
over
them
at
carlotta
careless
feet
do
carlotta
he
begged
again
you
do
have
to
scare
me
into
subjection
you
know
if
i
had
anything
to
justify
me
for
asking
you
to
marry
me
i
do
it
this
minute
without
prompting
you
ought
to
know
that
and
you
know
i
jealous
enough
already
of
the
rest
of
without
your
rubbing
it
in
now
do
worry
old
dear
smiled
carlotta
i
do
care
a
snap
of
my
fingers
for
any
of
the
poor
worms
though
i
would
needlessly
set
foot
on
as
for
justifications
i
have
a
whole
bag
of
them
up
my
sleeve
ready
to
spill
out
like
a
pack
of
cards
when
the
time
comes
you
do
have
to
concern
yourself
in
the
least
about
them
your
business
is
to
propose
woo
me
woo
me
for
now
i
am
in
a
holiday
humor
and
like
enough
to
consent
she
quoted
tony
lines
and
leaning
toward
him
lifted
her
flower
face
close
to
his
shall
i
count
ten
she
teased
carlotta
have
mercy
you
are
driving
me
crazy
pretty
thing
it
would
be
for
me
to
propose
to
you
before
i
even
got
my
sheepskin
jolly
pleased
your
father
would
be
would
he
to
be
presented
with
a
jobless
penniless
nonsense
said
carlotta
crisply
it
would
matter
if
you
did
even
have
a
fig
leaf
you
would
be
either
jobless
or
penniless
if
you
were
his
he
has
pennies
enough
for
all
of
us
and
enough
jobs
for
you
which
is
quite
sufficient
unto
the
day
do
be
stiff
and
silly
phil
and
do
set
your
jaw
like
that
i
hate
men
who
set
their
jaws
it
is
at
all
becoming
i
do
say
my
dear
misguided
daddy
would
raise
a
merry
little
row
just
at
first
he
often
raises
merry
little
rows
over
things
i
want
to
do
but
in
the
end
he
always
comes
round
to
my
way
of
thinking
and
wants
precisely
what
i
want
everything
will
be
smooth
as
silk
i
promise
you
i
know
what
i
am
talking
about
i
thought
it
out
very
carefully
i
do
make
up
my
mind
in
a
hurry
but
when
i
do
decide
what
i
want
i
take
it
you
ca
take
this
said
philip
lambert
carlotta
drew
back
and
stared
her
violet
eyes
very
wide
open
never
in
all
her
twenty
two
years
had
any
man
said
ca
to
her
in
that
tone
it
was
a
totally
new
experience
for
a
moment
she
was
too
astounded
even
to
be
angry
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
a
little
limply
i
mean
i
wo
take
your
father
pennies
nor
hold
down
a
i
not
fitted
for
even
for
the
sake
of
being
his
and
i
wo
marry
you
until
i
am
able
to
support
you
on
the
kind
of
job
i
am
fitted
for
and
may
i
inquire
what
that
is
demanded
carlotta
sharply
recovering
sufficiently
to
let
the
thorns
she
usually
kept
gracefully
concealed
prick
out
from
among
the
roses
phil
laughed
shortly
do
faint
carlotta
i
am
eminently
fitted
to
be
a
village
in
fact
that
is
what
i
shall
be
in
less
than
two
weeks
i
am
going
into
partnership
with
my
father
the
new
sign
lambert
and
is
being
painted
now
carlotta
gasped
phil
you
would
you
ca
oh
yes
carlotta
i
not
only
could
and
would
but
i
am
going
to
it
has
been
understood
ever
since
i
first
went
to
college
that
when
i
was
out
i
put
my
shoulder
to
the
wheel
beside
dad
he
has
been
pushing
alone
too
long
as
it
is
he
needs
me
you
do
know
how
happy
he
and
mums
are
about
it
it
is
what
they
have
dreamed
about
and
planned
for
years
the
only
son
you
know
it
up
to
me
but
phil
it
is
an
awful
sacrifice
for
you
for
once
carlotta
forgot
herself
completely
not
a
bit
of
it
it
is
a
flourishing
concern
not
just
a
village
shop
a
real
department
store
doing
real
business
and
making
real
money
dad
built
it
all
up
himself
too
he
has
a
right
to
be
proud
of
it
and
i
am
lucky
to
be
able
to
step
in
and
enjoy
the
results
of
all
his
years
of
hard
work
i
not
fooling
myself
about
that
do
get
the
impression
i
am
being
a
martyr
or
anything
of
the
sort
i
most
distinctly
am
not
carlotta
made
a
little
inarticulate
exclamation
mechanically
she
counted
the
cars
of
the
train
which
was
winding
its
black
trail
far
down
below
them
in
the
valley
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
the
moon
would
be
difficult
to
dislodge
perhaps
carlotta
did
know
much
about
moons
after
all
phil
went
on
talking
earnestly
putting
his
case
before
her
as
best
he
might
he
owed
it
to
carlotta
to
try
to
make
her
understand
if
he
could
he
thought
that
under
all
the
whimsicalities
it
was
rather
fine
of
her
to
lay
down
her
princess
pride
and
let
him
see
she
cared
that
she
really
wanted
him
it
made
her
dearer
harder
to
resist
than
ever
if
only
he
could
make
her
understand
you
see
i
not
fitted
for
city
life
he
explained
i
hate
it
i
like
to
live
where
everybody
has
a
plot
of
green
grass
in
front
of
his
house
to
set
his
rocking
chair
in
sunday
afternoons
where
people
can
have
trees
that
they
know
as
well
as
they
know
their
own
family
and
do
have
to
go
to
a
park
to
look
at
where
they
can
grow
tulips
and
green
peas
and
babies
too
if
the
lord
is
good
to
i
want
to
plant
my
roots
where
people
are
neighborly
and
interested
in
each
other
as
human
beings
not
shut
away
like
cave
dwellers
in
apartment
houses
not
knowing
or
caring
who
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
i
should
get
to
hating
people
if
i
had
to
be
crowded
into
a
subway
with
them
day
after
day
treading
on
their
toes
and
they
on
mine
altogether
i
am
afraid
i
have
a
small
town
mind
sweetheart
he
smiled
at
carlotta
as
he
made
the
confession
but
she
did
not
respond
her
face
gave
not
the
slightest
indication
as
to
what
was
going
on
in
her
mind
as
he
talked
i
would
be
any
good
at
all
in
your
father
establishment
never
wanted
to
make
money
on
the
grand
scale
i
would
be
my
son
if
i
did
i
could
be
a
banker
or
a
broker
if
i
tried
and
i
want
to
try
not
even
for
the
sake
of
having
me
carlotta
voice
was
as
expressionless
as
her
face
she
still
watched
the
train
almost
vanishing
from
sight
now
in
the
far
distance
leaving
a
cloud
of
ugly
black
smoke
behind
it
to
mar
the
lustrous
azure
of
the
june
sky
phil
too
looked
out
over
the
valley
he
dared
not
look
at
carlotta
he
was
young
and
very
much
in
love
he
wanted
carlotta
exceedingly
for
a
minute
everything
blurred
before
his
gaze
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
try
anything
risk
anything
give
up
anything
ride
rough
shod
over
anything
even
his
own
ideals
to
gain
her
it
was
a
tense
moment
he
came
very
near
surrendering
and
thereby
making
himself
and
carlotta
too
unhappy
forever
after
but
something
stronger
held
him
back
oddly
enough
he
seemed
to
see
that
sign
lambert
and
written
large
all
over
the
valley
his
gaze
came
back
to
carlotta
their
eyes
met
the
hardness
was
gone
from
the
girl
leaving
a
wistful
tenderness
a
sweet
surrender
no
man
had
ever
seen
there
before
a
weaker
lad
would
have
capitulated
under
that
wonderful
new
look
of
carlotta
it
only
strengthened
philip
lambert
it
was
for
her
as
well
as
himself
i
am
sorry
carlotta
he
said
i
could
do
it
though
i
give
you
my
heart
to
cut
up
into
pieces
if
it
could
make
you
happy
maybe
i
would
risk
it
for
myself
but
i
ca
go
back
on
my
father
even
for
you
then
you
do
love
me
carlotta
rare
and
lovely
tenderness
was
burned
away
on
the
instant
in
a
quick
blaze
of
anger
yes
i
do
dear
it
is
because
i
love
you
that
i
ca
do
it
i
have
to
give
you
the
best
of
me
not
the
worst
of
me
and
the
best
of
me
belongs
in
dunbury
i
wish
i
could
make
you
understand
and
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
since
i
ca
come
to
you
you
could
care
enough
to
come
to
me
but
i
am
not
going
to
ask
it
not
now
anyway
i
have
the
right
perhaps
in
two
years
time
if
you
are
still
free
i
shall
but
not
now
it
would
be
fair
two
years
from
now
and
long
before
i
shall
be
married
said
carlotta
with
a
sharp
little
metallic
note
in
her
voice
she
was
trying
to
keep
from
crying
but
he
did
not
know
that
and
winced
both
at
her
words
and
tone
that
must
be
as
it
will
he
answered
soberly
i
can
not
do
any
differently
i
would
if
i
could
it
it
is
so
easy
to
give
you
up
oh
carlotta
i
love
you
and
suddenly
unexpectedly
to
himself
and
carlotta
he
had
her
in
his
arms
and
was
covering
her
face
with
kisses
carlotta
cheeks
flamed
she
was
no
longer
a
lily
but
a
red
red
rose
never
in
her
life
had
she
been
so
frightened
so
ecstatic
with
all
her
dainty
capricious
flirtations
she
had
always
deliberately
fenced
herself
behind
barriers
no
man
had
ever
held
her
or
kissed
her
like
this
the
embrace
and
kisses
of
a
lover
to
whom
she
belonged
phil
do
dear
i
mean
do
dear
i
love
you
she
whispered
but
her
words
brought
phil
back
to
his
senses
his
arms
dropped
and
he
drew
away
ashamed
remorseful
he
was
no
saint
according
to
his
way
of
thinking
a
man
might
kiss
a
girl
now
and
then
under
impulsion
of
moonshine
or
mischief
but
lightly
always
like
thistledown
a
man
kiss
a
girl
as
he
had
just
kissed
carlotta
unless
he
had
the
right
to
marry
her
it
was
playing
straight
i
sorry
carlotta
i
did
mean
to
he
said
miserably
i
not
i
glad
i
think
way
down
in
my
heart
i
always
wanted
you
to
kiss
me
though
i
did
know
it
would
be
like
that
i
knew
your
kisses
would
be
different
because
are
different
how
am
i
different
phil
voice
was
humble
in
his
own
eyes
he
seemed
pitifully
undifferent
precisely
like
all
the
other
rash
intemperate
male
fools
in
the
world
you
are
different
every
way
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
you
all
of
them
but
maybe
you
are
chiefly
different
because
i
love
you
and
i
love
the
rest
except
for
daddy
i
never
loved
anybody
but
myself
before
and
when
you
kissed
me
i
just
seemed
to
feel
my
going
right
out
of
me
as
if
i
stopped
belonging
to
myself
and
began
to
belong
to
you
forever
and
ever
it
scared
me
but
i
liked
it
you
darling
fatuously
carlotta
will
you
marry
me
it
was
out
at
last
the
words
she
claimed
she
had
brought
him
up
the
mountain
to
say
the
words
he
had
willed
not
to
speak
of
course
kiss
me
again
phil
we
wire
daddy
tomorrow
wire
him
what
the
mention
of
carlotta
father
brought
phil
back
to
earth
with
a
jolt
that
we
are
engaged
and
that
he
is
to
find
a
suitable
job
for
you
so
we
can
be
married
right
away
chanted
carlotta
happily
phil
rainbow
vanished
almost
as
soon
as
it
had
appeared
in
the
heavens
he
drew
a
long
breath
carlotta
i
did
mean
that
i
ca
be
engaged
to
you
that
way
i
meant
will
you
marry
me
when
i
can
afford
to
have
a
fairy
princess
in
my
home
carlotta
stared
at
him
her
rainbow
too
fading
you
did
she
asked
vaguely
i
thought
i
know
groaned
phil
it
was
stupid
of
me
worse
than
stupid
it
ca
be
helped
now
i
suppose
the
damage
is
done
shall
we
take
the
next
car
down
it
is
getting
late
he
rose
and
put
out
both
hands
to
help
her
to
her
feet
for
a
moment
they
stood
silent
in
front
of
the
gray
bowlder
the
end
of
the
world
seemed
to
have
come
for
them
both
it
was
like
humpty
dumpty
all
the
king
horses
and
all
the
king
men
could
restore
things
to
their
old
state
nor
bring
back
the
lost
happiness
of
that
one
perfect
moment
when
they
had
belonged
to
each
other
without
reservations
carlotta
put
out
her
hand
and
touched
philip
do
feel
too
badly
phil
she
said
as
you
say
it
ca
be
helped
nothing
can
be
helped
it
just
had
to
be
this
way
we
either
of
us
make
ourselves
over
or
change
the
way
we
look
at
things
and
want
things
i
wish
i
were
different
for
both
our
sakes
i
wish
i
were
big
enough
and
brave
enough
and
fine
enough
to
say
i
would
marry
you
anyway
and
stop
being
a
princess
but
i
do
dare
i
know
myself
too
well
i
might
think
i
could
do
it
up
here
where
it
is
all
still
and
purple
and
sweet
and
sacred
but
when
we
got
down
to
the
valley
again
i
am
afraid
i
could
live
up
to
it
nor
to
you
philip
my
king
forgive
me
phil
bent
and
kissed
her
again
not
passionately
this
time
but
with
a
kind
of
reverent
solemnity
as
if
he
were
performing
a
rite
never
mind
sweetheart
i
do
blame
you
any
more
than
you
blame
me
we
got
to
take
life
as
we
find
it
not
try
to
make
it
over
into
something
different
to
please
ourselves
if
some
day
you
meet
the
man
who
can
make
you
happy
in
your
way
i
not
grudge
him
the
right
i
not
sure
i
shall
even
envy
him
i
had
my
moment
but
phil
you
are
going
to
be
awfully
unhappy
about
me
sighed
carlotta
promise
you
wo
you
know
i
never
wanted
to
hurt
the
moon
dear
philip
shook
his
head
do
worry
about
the
moon
it
is
a
tough
old
orb
i
sha
be
too
unhappy
a
man
has
a
whole
lot
of
things
beside
love
in
his
life
i
am
not
going
to
let
myself
be
such
a
fool
as
to
be
miserable
because
things
started
out
a
little
differently
from
what
i
would
like
to
have
them
his
smile
was
brave
but
his
eyes
belied
the
smile
and
carlotta
heart
smote
her
you
will
forget
me
she
said
it
was
half
a
reproach
half
a
command
again
he
shook
his
head
in
denial
do
you
remember
the
queen
who
claimed
she
had
calais
stamped
on
her
heart
well
open
mine
a
hundred
years
from
now
and
you
read
but
wo
you
ever
marry
pursued
carlotta
with
youth
insistence
on
probing
wounds
to
the
quick
i
do
know
probably
he
added
honestly
a
man
is
a
poor
stick
in
this
world
without
a
home
and
kiddies
if
i
do
it
will
be
a
long
time
yet
though
it
will
be
many
a
year
before
i
see
anybody
but
you
no
matter
where
i
look
but
i
am
horrid
selfish
cowardly
altogether
horrid
are
you
smiled
phil
i
wonder
anyway
i
love
you
come
on
dear
we
have
to
hurry
the
car
is
nearly
due
and
as
twilight
settled
down
over
the
valley
like
a
great
bird
brooding
over
its
nest
philip
and
carlotta
went
down
from
the
mountain
chapter
iv
a
boy
who
was
an
ass
but
behaved
like
one
baccalaureate
services
being
over
and
the
graduates
duly
exhorted
to
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
the
latter
were
for
a
time
permitted
to
alight
from
their
lofty
pedestal
in
the
public
eye
and
to
revert
temporarily
to
the
comfortable
if
less
exalted
state
of
being
plain
every
day
human
girls
while
philip
and
carlotta
went
up
on
the
heights
fondly
believing
they
were
settling
their
destinies
forever
tony
had
been
enjoying
an
afternoon
with
her
uncle
and
her
brother
ted
suddenly
she
looked
at
her
watch
and
sprang
up
from
the
arm
of
her
uncle
chair
on
which
she
had
been
perched
chattering
and
content
for
a
couple
of
hours
my
goodness
it
is
most
four
dick
will
be
here
in
a
minute
may
i
call
up
the
garage
and
ask
them
to
send
the
car
around
i
dying
for
a
ride
we
can
go
over
to
south
hadley
and
get
the
twins
if
you
like
i
sure
they
must
have
had
enough
of
mt
holyoke
by
this
time
car
out
of
commission
grunted
ted
from
behind
his
sporting
sheet
out
of
commission
since
when
inquired
doctor
holiday
it
was
all
right
when
you
took
it
to
the
garage
last
night
i
went
out
for
a
joy
ride
and
had
a
smash
up
explained
his
nephew
nonchalantly
and
still
hidden
behind
the
newspaper
oh
ted
how
could
you
when
you
know
we
want
to
use
the
car
every
minute
there
was
sharp
dismay
and
reproach
in
tony
voice
well
i
did
smash
it
on
purpose
did
i
grumbled
her
brother
throwing
down
the
paper
i
sorry
tony
but
it
ca
be
helped
now
you
better
be
thankful
i
not
out
of
commission
myself
came
darn
near
being
oh
ted
there
was
only
concern
and
sympathy
in
his
sister
exclamation
this
time
tony
adored
her
brothers
she
went
over
to
ted
now
scrutinizing
him
as
if
she
half
expected
to
see
him
minus
an
arm
or
a
leg
you
were
hurt
she
begged
reassurance
nope
nothing
to
signify
got
some
purple
patches
on
my
person
and
a
twist
to
my
wrist
but
that
all
i
was
always
a
lucky
devil
got
more
lives
than
a
cat
he
was
obviously
trying
to
carry
matters
off
lightly
but
never
once
did
he
meet
his
uncle
eyes
though
he
was
quite
aware
they
were
fixed
on
him
tony
sighed
and
shook
her
head
troubled
i
wish
you
would
take
such
risks
she
mourned
some
day
you
get
dreadfully
hurt
please
be
careful
uncle
phil
she
appealed
to
the
higher
court
do
tell
him
he
must
speed
so
he
wo
listen
to
me
if
ted
has
learned
the
folly
of
speeding
by
now
i
am
afraid
that
nothing
i
can
say
will
have
much
effect
i
wonder
just
here
the
telephone
interrupted
with
an
announcement
that
carson
was
waiting
downstairs
tony
flew
from
the
phone
to
dab
powder
on
her
nose
since
we
ca
go
riding
i
think
i
take
dick
for
a
walk
in
paradise
she
announced
into
the
mirror
will
you
come
too
uncle
phil
no
thank
you
dear
run
along
and
tell
dick
we
expect
him
back
to
supper
with
us
the
doctor
held
open
the
door
for
his
niece
then
turned
back
to
ted
who
was
also
on
his
feet
now
murmuring
something
about
going
out
for
a
stroll
wait
a
bit
son
suppose
you
tell
me
first
precisely
what
happened
last
night
did
tell
you
the
boy
fumbled
sulkily
at
the
leaves
of
a
magazine
that
lay
on
the
table
i
took
the
car
out
and
when
i
was
speeding
like
sam
hill
out
on
the
florence
road
i
struck
a
hole
she
stood
up
on
her
ear
and
pitched
u
er
out
in
the
gutter
stuck
her
own
nose
into
a
telephone
pole
i
telephoned
the
garage
people
to
go
after
her
this
morning
they
told
me
a
while
ago
she
was
pretty
badly
stove
up
and
it
will
probably
take
a
couple
of
weeks
to
get
her
in
order
the
story
came
out
jerkily
and
the
narrator
kept
his
eyes
consistently
floorward
during
the
recital
is
that
all
what
more
do
you
want
curtly
i
said
i
was
sorry
if
that
is
what
you
mean
it
is
what
i
mean
ted
i
assume
you
did
deliberately
go
out
to
break
my
car
and
that
you
are
not
particularly
proud
of
the
outcome
of
your
joy
ride
i
mean
exactly
what
i
asked
have
you
told
me
the
whole
story
ted
was
silent
mechanically
rolling
the
corner
of
the
rug
under
his
foot
his
uncle
studied
the
unhappy
young
face
his
mind
worked
back
to
that
inadvertent
u
er
of
the
confession
were
you
alone
he
asked
a
scarlet
flush
swept
the
lad
face
died
away
leaving
it
a
little
white
yes
the
answer
was
low
but
distinct
it
was
like
a
knife
thrust
to
the
doctor
in
all
the
eight
years
in
which
he
had
fathered
ned
sons
both
before
and
since
his
brother
death
never
once
to
his
knowledge
had
either
one
lied
to
him
even
to
save
himself
discomfort
censure
or
punishment
with
all
their
boyish
vagaries
and
misdeeds
it
had
been
the
one
thing
he
could
count
on
absolutely
their
unflinching
invariable
honesty
yet
surely
as
the
june
sun
was
shining
outside
ted
had
lied
to
him
just
now
why
rash
twenty
was
too
young
to
go
its
way
unchallenged
and
unguided
he
was
responsible
for
the
lad
whose
dead
father
had
committed
him
to
his
charge
only
a
few
weeks
before
his
death
ned
had
written
with
curious
prescience
if
i
go
out
any
time
phil
i
know
you
will
look
after
the
children
as
i
would
myself
or
better
keep
your
eye
on
ted
especially
his
heart
is
in
the
right
place
but
he
has
a
reckless
devil
in
him
that
will
bring
him
and
all
of
us
to
grief
if
it
is
laid
doctor
holiday
went
over
and
laid
a
hand
on
each
of
the
lad
hunched
shoulders
look
at
me
ted
he
commanded
gently
the
old
habit
of
obedience
strong
in
spite
of
his
twenty
years
ted
raised
his
eyes
but
dropped
them
again
on
the
instant
as
if
they
were
lead
weighted
that
is
the
first
time
you
ever
lied
to
me
i
think
lad
said
the
doctor
quietly
a
quiver
passed
over
the
boy
face
but
his
lips
set
tighter
than
ever
and
he
pulled
away
from
his
uncle
hands
and
turned
staring
out
of
the
window
at
a
rather
dusty
and
bedraggled
looking
hydrangea
on
the
lawn
i
wonder
if
it
was
necessary
the
quiet
voice
continued
i
have
the
slightest
wish
to
be
hard
on
you
i
just
want
to
understand
you
know
that
son
do
you
the
boy
head
went
up
at
that
his
gaze
deserted
the
hydrangea
for
the
first
time
that
day
met
his
uncle
squarely
if
somewhat
miserably
it
is
that
uncle
phil
you
have
every
right
to
come
down
on
me
i
had
any
business
to
have
the
car
out
at
all
much
less
take
fool
chances
with
it
but
honestly
i
have
told
you
all
all
i
can
tell
i
did
lie
to
you
just
now
i
was
alone
there
was
a
a
girl
with
me
ted
face
was
hot
again
as
he
made
the
confession
i
see
mused
the
doctor
was
she
hurt
no
that
is
not
much
she
hurt
her
shoulder
some
and
cut
her
head
a
bit
the
details
came
out
reluctantly
as
if
impelled
by
the
steady
eyes
she
telephoned
me
today
she
was
all
right
it
a
miracle
we
were
both
killed
though
we
might
have
been
as
easy
as
anything
you
said
just
now
nothing
you
could
say
would
make
me
have
sense
about
speeding
i
guess
what
happened
last
night
ought
to
knock
sense
into
me
if
anything
could
i
say
uncle
phil
well
as
the
boy
paused
obviously
embarrassed
if
you
do
mind
i
rather
not
say
anything
more
about
the
girl
she
i
guess
she
rather
i
would
he
wound
up
confusedly
very
well
that
is
your
affair
and
hers
thank
you
for
coming
halfway
to
meet
me
it
made
it
easier
all
around
the
doctor
held
out
his
hand
and
the
boy
took
it
eagerly
you
are
great
to
me
uncle
phil
lots
better
than
i
deserve
please
do
think
i
do
see
that
and
truly
i
am
awfully
ashamed
of
smashing
the
car
and
not
telling
you
as
i
ought
to
have
this
morning
and
spoiling
tony
fun
and
and
everything
ted
swallowed
something
down
hard
as
if
the
everything
included
a
good
deal
i
do
see
why
i
have
to
be
always
getting
into
scrapes
ca
seem
to
help
it
somehow
guess
i
was
made
that
way
just
as
larry
was
born
steady
that
is
a
spineless
jellyfish
point
of
view
ted
do
fool
yourself
with
it
there
is
no
earthly
reason
why
you
should
keep
drifting
from
one
escapade
to
another
get
some
backbone
into
you
son
ted
face
clouded
again
at
that
though
he
was
sulky
this
time
he
was
remembering
some
other
disagreeable
confessions
he
had
to
make
before
long
he
knew
this
was
a
good
opening
for
them
but
somehow
he
could
not
drive
himself
to
follow
it
up
he
could
only
digest
a
limited
amount
of
humble
pie
at
a
time
and
had
already
swallowed
nearly
all
he
could
stand
still
he
skirted
warily
along
the
edge
of
the
dilemma
i
suppose
you
think
i
made
an
awful
ass
of
myself
at
college
this
year
he
averred
gloomily
i
do
think
it
i
know
it
the
doctor
eyes
twinkled
a
little
then
he
grew
sober
why
do
you
ted
you
are
really
an
ass
you
know
if
you
were
there
might
be
some
excuse
for
behaving
like
one
ted
flushed
that
what
larry
told
me
last
spring
when
he
was
pitching
into
me
about
well
about
something
i
do
know
why
i
do
uncle
phil
honest
i
do
maybe
it
is
because
i
hate
college
so
and
all
the
stale
old
stuff
they
try
to
cram
down
our
throats
i
get
so
mad
and
sick
and
disgusted
with
the
whole
thing
that
i
feel
as
if
i
had
to
do
something
to
offset
it
something
that
is
real
and
live
even
if
it
is
according
to
rules
and
regulations
i
hate
rules
and
regulations
i
not
a
mummy
and
i
do
want
to
be
made
to
act
as
if
i
were
i
be
a
long
time
dead
and
i
want
to
get
a
whole
lot
of
fun
out
of
life
first
i
hate
studying
i
want
to
do
things
uncle
phil
well
i
do
want
to
go
back
to
college
what
do
you
want
to
do
join
the
canadian
forces
it
makes
me
sick
to
have
a
war
going
on
and
me
not
in
it
dad
quit
college
for
west
point
and
everybody
thought
it
was
all
right
i
do
see
why
i
should
get
into
it
i
would
fall
down
on
that
i
promise
you
i
make
you
proud
of
me
instead
of
ashamed
the
way
you
are
now
the
boy
voice
and
eyes
were
unusually
earnest
his
uncle
did
not
answer
instantly
he
knew
that
there
was
some
truth
in
his
nephew
analysis
of
the
situation
it
was
his
uneasy
superabundant
energy
and
craving
for
action
that
made
him
find
the
more
or
less
restricted
life
of
the
college
a
burden
a
bore
and
an
exasperation
and
drove
him
to
crazy
escapades
and
deeds
of
flagrant
lawlessness
he
needed
no
assurance
that
the
boy
would
not
fall
down
at
soldiering
he
would
take
to
it
as
a
duck
to
water
and
the
discipline
might
be
the
making
of
him
prove
the
way
to
exorcise
the
devil
still
there
were
other
considerations
which
to
him
seemed
paramount
for
the
time
at
least
i
understand
how
you
feel
ted
he
said
at
last
if
we
get
into
the
war
ourselves
i
wo
say
a
word
against
your
going
i
should
expect
you
to
go
we
all
would
but
in
the
meantime
as
i
see
it
you
are
not
quite
a
free
agent
granny
is
old
and
very
very
feeble
she
has
gotten
over
your
father
death
she
grieves
over
it
still
if
you
went
to
war
i
think
it
would
kill
her
she
could
bear
the
strain
and
anxiety
patience
laddie
you
do
want
to
hurt
her
do
you
i
not
said
ted
a
little
grudgingly
then
it
is
no
uncle
phil
i
think
it
ought
to
be
no
of
your
own
will
for
granny
sake
we
live
to
ourselves
alone
in
this
world
we
ca
but
aside
from
granny
i
am
not
at
all
certain
i
should
approve
of
your
leaving
college
just
because
it
does
happen
to
be
exciting
enough
to
meet
your
fancy
and
means
work
you
are
too
lazy
and
irresponsible
to
settle
down
to
doing
looks
a
little
like
quitting
to
me
and
holidays
are
usually
quitters
you
know
he
smiled
at
the
boy
but
ted
did
not
smile
back
the
thrust
about
holidays
and
quitters
went
home
i
suppose
it
has
got
to
be
college
again
if
you
say
so
he
said
soberly
after
a
minute
thank
heaven
there
are
three
months
ahead
clear
though
first
to
play
in
well
yes
why
not
it
is
all
right
to
play
in
vacation
is
it
the
boy
retorted
a
shade
aggressively
possibly
if
you
have
earned
the
vacation
by
working
beforehand
ted
eyes
fell
at
that
this
was
dangerously
near
the
ground
of
those
uncomfortable
inevitable
confessions
which
he
meant
to
put
off
as
long
as
possible
do
you
mind
if
i
go
out
now
he
asked
with
unusual
meekness
after
a
moment
rather
awkward
silence
no
indeed
go
ahead
i
had
my
say
be
back
for
supper
with
us
dunno
and
ted
disappeared
into
the
adjoining
room
which
connected
with
his
uncle
in
a
moment
he
was
back
expensive
panama
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
lighted
cigarette
held
jauntily
in
the
other
i
meant
to
tell
you
you
could
take
the
car
repairs
out
of
my
allowance
he
remarked
casually
but
with
his
eye
shrewdly
on
his
guardian
as
he
made
the
announcement
very
well
replied
the
latter
quietly
then
he
smiled
a
little
seeing
his
nephew
crestfallen
expression
that
was
just
what
you
wanted
me
to
say
was
it
he
added
not
exactly
admitted
the
boy
with
a
returning
grin
all
right
uncle
phil
i
game
i
pay
up
a
moment
later
his
uncle
heard
his
whistle
as
he
went
down
the
driveway
apparently
as
care
free
as
if
narrow
escapes
from
death
were
nothing
in
his
young
life
the
doctor
shook
his
head
dubiously
as
he
watched
him
from
the
window
he
would
have
felt
more
dubious
still
had
he
seen
the
boy
board
a
florence
car
a
few
minutes
later
on
his
way
to
keep
a
rendezvous
with
the
girl
about
whom
he
had
not
wished
to
talk
chapter
v
when
youth
meets
youth
three
quarters
of
an
hour
later
ted
was
seated
on
a
log
near
a
small
rustic
bridge
beneath
which
flowed
a
limpid
gurgling
stream
on
a
log
beside
him
sat
a
girl
of
perhaps
eighteen
years
exceedingly
handsome
with
the
flaming
kind
of
beauty
like
a
poppy
striking
to
the
eye
she
was
vividly
effective
against
the
background
of
deep
green
spruces
and
white
birch
in
her
bright
pink
dress
and
large
drooping
black
hat
her
coloring
was
brilliant
her
lips
full
scarlet
ripely
sensuous
beneath
her
straight
black
brows
her
sparkling
black
eyes
gleamed
with
restless
eagerness
an
ugly
jagged
still
fresh
wound
showed
beneath
a
carefully
curled
fringe
of
hair
on
her
forehead
i
do
like
meeting
you
this
way
ted
was
saying
are
you
sure
your
grandfather
would
have
cut
up
rough
if
i
had
come
to
the
house
and
called
properly
you
betcher
said
his
companion
promptly
you
do
know
grandpa
death
on
young
men
he
wo
let
one
come
within
a
mile
of
me
if
he
can
help
it
he
throw
a
fit
if
he
knew
i
was
here
with
you
now
we
should
worry
what
he
do
know
wo
hurt
him
she
concluded
with
a
toss
of
her
head
then
as
ted
looked
dubious
she
added
you
just
leave
grandpa
to
me
if
you
had
had
your
way
you
would
have
spilled
the
beans
by
telephoning
me
this
morning
at
the
wrong
time
see
how
much
better
i
fixed
it
i
told
him
a
piece
of
wood
flew
up
and
hit
me
when
i
was
chopping
kindling
before
breakfast
and
that
my
head
ached
so
i
feel
like
going
to
church
then
the
minute
he
was
out
of
the
yard
i
ran
to
the
and
got
you
at
the
hotel
it
was
perfectly
simple
that
way
slick
as
grease
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
make
a
date
we
could
have
gotten
away
with
it
otherwise
ted
still
looked
dubious
the
phrase
gotten
away
with
it
jarred
at
the
moment
he
was
not
particularly
proud
of
their
mutual
success
in
getting
away
with
it
the
girl
was
his
kind
he
realized
that
now
he
saw
her
for
the
first
time
in
daylight
she
had
looked
all
right
to
him
on
the
train
night
before
last
indeed
he
had
been
distinctly
fascinated
by
her
flashing
gypsy
beauty
ready
laughter
and
quick
keen
half
fresh
repartee
when
he
had
started
a
casual
conversation
with
her
when
they
chanced
to
be
seat
mates
from
holyoke
on
casual
conversations
were
apt
to
turn
into
casual
flirtations
with
ted
holiday
afterward
he
was
sure
whether
she
had
dared
him
or
he
had
dared
her
to
plan
the
midnight
joy
ride
which
had
so
narrowly
missed
ending
in
a
tragedy
anyway
it
had
seemed
a
jolly
lark
at
the
time
a
test
of
the
mettle
and
mother
wit
of
both
of
them
to
get
away
with
it
and
she
had
looked
good
to
him
last
night
when
he
met
her
at
the
appointed
trysting
place
after
as
you
like
it
she
had
come
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
trees
behind
which
she
had
been
lurking
wearing
a
scarlet
and
a
long
dark
cloak
her
eyes
shining
like
january
stars
he
had
liked
her
nerve
in
coming
out
like
that
to
meet
him
alone
at
midnight
he
had
liked
the
way
she
sassed
him
back
and
put
him
in
his
place
when
he
had
tried
impudently
enough
to
kiss
her
he
had
liked
the
way
she
laughed
when
he
asked
her
if
she
was
afraid
to
speed
on
the
home
stretch
it
was
her
laugh
that
had
spurred
him
on
intoxicated
him
made
him
send
the
car
leaping
faster
and
still
faster
obeying
his
reckless
will
then
the
crash
had
come
it
was
indeed
a
miracle
that
they
had
not
both
been
killed
no
thanks
to
the
rash
young
driver
that
they
had
not
been
it
would
be
many
a
day
before
ted
holiday
would
forget
that
nightmare
of
dread
and
remorse
which
took
possession
of
him
as
he
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
and
went
over
to
where
the
girl
motionless
form
lay
on
the
grass
her
face
dead
white
the
blood
flowing
from
her
forehead
never
had
he
been
so
thankful
for
anything
in
his
life
as
he
was
when
he
saw
her
bright
eyes
snap
open
and
heard
her
unsteady
little
giggle
as
she
murmured
my
but
i
thought
i
was
dead
did
you
game
to
her
fingertips
she
had
been
ted
acknowledged
that
even
now
that
the
glamour
had
worn
off
never
once
had
she
whimpered
over
her
injuries
never
hurled
a
single
word
of
blame
at
him
for
the
misadventure
that
had
come
within
a
hair
breadth
of
being
the
last
for
them
both
it
was
a
bit
more
your
fault
than
mine
she
had
waived
aside
his
apologies
and
it
was
great
while
it
lasted
i
would
have
missed
it
for
anything
though
i
glad
i
not
dead
before
i
had
a
chance
to
really
live
all
i
ask
is
that
you
wo
tell
a
soul
i
was
out
with
you
grandpa
would
think
i
was
headed
straight
for
purgatory
if
he
knew
i
wo
ted
had
promised
glibly
enough
and
had
kept
his
promise
even
at
the
cost
of
lying
to
his
uncle
a
memory
which
hurt
like
the
toothache
even
now
but
looking
at
the
girl
now
in
her
tawdry
inappropriate
garb
he
suffered
a
revulsion
of
feeling
what
he
had
admired
in
her
as
good
sport
quality
seemed
cheap
now
his
own
conduct
even
cheaper
his
reaction
against
himself
was
fully
as
poignant
as
his
reaction
against
her
he
was
suddenly
ashamed
of
his
joy
ride
ashamed
that
he
had
ever
wished
or
tried
to
kiss
her
ashamed
that
he
had
fallen
in
with
her
suggestion
for
a
clandestine
meeting
this
afternoon
possibly
madeline
sensed
that
he
was
cold
to
her
charms
at
the
moment
she
flashed
a
shrewd
glance
at
him
you
do
like
me
as
well
as
you
did
last
night
she
challenged
caught
ted
tried
to
make
denial
but
the
effort
was
scarcely
a
success
he
had
yet
to
learn
the
art
of
lying
gracefully
to
a
lady
you
do
she
repeated
you
need
try
to
pretend
you
do
you
fool
me
you
getting
cold
feet
already
you
remembering
just
just
a
ted
winced
again
at
that
he
did
not
like
the
word
either
though
to
his
shame
he
had
been
above
the
thing
itself
do
talk
like
that
madeline
you
know
i
like
you
you
were
immense
last
night
any
other
girl
i
know
except
my
sister
tony
would
have
had
hysterics
and
fainting
fits
and
lord
knows
what
else
with
half
the
excuse
you
had
and
you
never
made
a
bit
of
fuss
about
your
head
though
it
must
have
hurt
like
the
deuce
i
say
you
do
think
it
is
going
to
leave
a
scar
do
you
he
leaned
forward
with
genuine
concern
to
examine
the
red
wound
i
think
it
is
more
than
likely
lot
you
care
ted
holiday
never
come
back
to
see
whether
it
leaves
a
scar
or
not
see
that
bee
over
there
nosing
around
that
elderberry
think
he
come
back
next
week
not
much
i
know
your
kind
scornfully
that
bit
into
the
lad
complacency
of
course
i
care
and
of
course
i
come
back
he
protested
though
a
moment
before
he
had
had
not
the
slightest
wish
or
purpose
to
see
her
again
rather
to
the
contrary
to
see
whether
there
is
a
scar
to
see
you
he
played
up
gallantly
her
hard
young
face
softened
will
you
honest
ted
holiday
will
you
come
back
she
put
out
her
hand
and
touched
his
her
eyes
were
suddenly
wistful
gentle
beseeching
sure
i
come
back
why
would
i
the
touch
of
her
hand
the
new
softness
almost
pathos
of
her
mood
touched
him
appealed
to
the
chivalry
always
latent
in
a
holiday
he
heard
her
breath
come
quickly
saw
her
full
bosom
heave
felt
the
warm
pressure
of
her
hand
he
wanted
to
put
his
arm
around
her
but
he
did
not
follow
the
impulse
the
code
of
holiday
noblesse
oblige
was
operating
i
wish
i
could
believe
that
madeline
sighed
looking
down
into
the
water
which
whirled
and
eddied
in
white
foam
and
splash
over
the
rocks
i
like
to
think
you
really
wanted
to
come
really
cared
about
seeing
me
again
i
know
i
not
your
kind
he
started
involuntarily
at
her
voicing
unexpectedly
his
own
recent
thought
oh
you
need
be
surprised
she
threw
at
him
half
angrily
do
you
suppose
i
know
that
better
than
you
do
do
you
suppose
i
know
what
the
girls
you
are
used
to
look
like
well
i
do
i
watched
on
the
street
on
the
campus
in
church
everywhere
i
even
seen
your
sister
and
watched
her
too
somebody
pointed
her
out
to
me
once
when
she
had
made
a
hit
in
a
play
and
i
seen
her
at
glee
club
concerts
and
at
vespers
in
the
choir
she
is
lovely
lovely
the
way
i
like
to
be
it
is
that
she
any
prettier
she
is
it
just
that
different
acts
different
looks
different
dresses
different
from
me
i
ca
make
myself
like
her
and
the
rest
no
matter
how
i
try
and
i
do
try
you
do
know
how
hard
i
try
i
got
this
dress
because
i
saw
your
sister
tony
wearing
a
pink
dress
once
i
thought
maybe
it
would
make
me
look
more
like
her
but
it
does
it
makes
me
look
more
like
her
than
ever
does
it
she
appealed
rather
disconcertingly
horrid
i
hate
it
i
do
know
much
about
girls
dresses
said
ted
but
now
you
speak
of
it
maybe
it
would
be
prettier
if
it
were
a
little
he
paused
for
a
word
quieter
he
decided
on
do
you
ever
wear
white
tony
wears
it
a
lot
and
i
think
she
looks
nice
in
it
i
got
a
white
dress
i
thought
about
putting
it
on
but
somehow
it
did
look
quite
nice
enough
i
thought
well
i
thought
i
looked
handsomer
in
the
pink
i
wanted
to
look
pretty
for
you
the
last
was
very
low
scarcely
audible
you
look
good
to
me
all
right
said
the
boy
heartily
and
he
meant
it
he
thought
she
looked
prettier
at
the
moment
than
she
had
looked
at
any
time
since
he
had
made
her
acquaintance
perhaps
he
was
right
she
had
laid
aside
for
once
her
mask
of
hard
boldness
and
was
just
a
simple
humble
rather
pathetic
little
girl
voicing
secret
aspirations
toward
a
fineness
life
had
denied
her
i
say
madeline
ted
went
on
you
do
meet
other
chaps
the
way
you
met
me
do
you
set
the
blind
to
lead
the
blind
if
there
was
anything
absurd
in
scapegrace
ted
turning
mentor
he
was
unconscious
of
the
absurdity
was
exceedingly
in
earnest
what
that
to
you
she
snapped
the
mask
back
into
place
nothing
that
is
i
would
that
all
she
laughed
shrilly
you
a
pretty
one
to
talk
she
scoffed
ted
flushed
i
know
i
am
see
here
madeline
you
dead
right
i
ought
not
to
have
taken
you
out
last
night
i
ought
not
to
have
let
you
meet
me
here
i
made
you
i
made
you
do
both
those
things
ted
shook
his
head
at
that
a
man
to
blame
always
he
asserted
no
he
is
denied
madeline
a
girl
to
blame
always
they
stared
at
each
other
a
moment
while
the
brook
tinkled
through
the
silence
then
they
both
laughed
at
the
solemnity
of
their
contradictions
but
there
is
a
bit
of
harm
done
went
on
madeline
you
see
i
knew
that
first
night
on
the
train
that
you
were
a
gentleman
some
gentlemen
are
rotters
said
ted
holiday
with
a
wisdom
beyond
his
twenty
years
but
you
are
not
no
i
not
but
some
other
chap
might
be
that
is
why
i
wish
you
would
promise
not
to
go
in
for
this
sort
of
thing
with
anybody
but
you
she
stipulated
not
with
anybody
at
all
corrected
ted
soberly
remembering
his
own
recent
restrained
impulse
to
put
his
arm
around
her
well
i
do
want
to
at
least
not
with
anybody
but
you
i
never
did
it
before
with
anybody
honest
ted
i
never
did
that
good
i
felt
sure
that
you
had
why
he
grinned
sheepishly
and
stooped
to
break
off
a
dry
twig
from
a
nearby
bush
by
the
way
you
did
let
me
kiss
you
he
admitted
a
fellow
likes
that
in
a
girl
did
you
know
it
he
tossed
away
the
twig
and
looked
back
at
the
girl
as
he
asked
the
question
i
thought
they
liked
the
other
thing
they
do
and
they
do
said
ted
his
paradox
again
betraying
a
scarcely
to
be
expected
wisdom
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
what
i
started
out
to
say
was
that
i
glad
you
do
make
a
practice
of
this
business
it
it
no
good
he
summed
up
i
know
madeline
nodded
understanding
of
the
import
of
his
warning
she
was
far
too
handsome
and
too
prematurely
developed
physically
to
be
devoid
of
experience
of
the
ways
of
the
opposite
sex
like
ophelia
she
knew
there
were
tricks
in
the
world
and
she
liked
frank
ted
holiday
the
better
for
reminding
her
of
them
i
wo
do
it
she
promised
that
is
unless
you
do
ever
come
back
yourself
i
do
know
what
i
do
then
something
awful
maybe
i
come
fast
enough
i
come
he
added
obeying
a
sudden
impulse
ted
fashion
will
you
the
girl
face
flushed
with
delight
when
afternoon
i
ca
dodge
the
ivy
stuff
in
the
morning
will
four
do
all
right
yes
come
here
to
this
same
place
i
say
madeline
ca
i
come
to
the
house
i
hate
doing
it
like
this
no
you
ca
if
you
want
to
see
me
you
have
to
do
it
this
way
lots
nicer
here
than
in
the
house
anyway
ted
acquiesced
since
he
had
no
choice
and
rose
announcing
that
it
was
time
to
go
now
we
do
have
to
go
yet
i
told
grandpa
i
was
going
to
spend
the
evening
with
my
friend
linda
bates
he
wo
know
we
can
stay
as
long
as
we
like
i
am
afraid
we
ca
said
ted
decidedly
come
on
my
lady
he
held
out
both
hands
and
madeline
let
him
draw
her
to
her
feet
though
she
was
pouting
a
little
at
his
gainsaying
of
her
wishes
you
may
kiss
me
now
she
said
suddenly
lifting
her
face
to
his
but
ted
backed
away
the
code
was
still
on
a
girl
of
his
own
kind
he
would
have
kissed
in
a
moment
at
such
provocation
or
none
but
he
had
an
odd
feeling
of
needing
to
protect
this
girl
from
herself
as
well
as
from
himself
you
had
more
sense
than
i
did
last
night
let
follow
your
lead
instead
of
mine
he
said
it
better
but
ted
you
will
come
she
pleaded
you
wo
forget
or
go
back
on
your
promise
of
course
i
come
promised
ted
again
readily
five
minutes
later
they
parted
he
to
take
his
car
and
she
to
stroll
in
the
opposite
direction
toward
her
friend
linda
house
he
is
a
dear
she
thought
i
glad
he
would
kiss
me
so
there
she
said
aloud
to
a
dusty
daisy
that
peered
up
at
her
rather
mockingly
from
the
gutter
an
automobile
horn
honked
behind
her
she
stepped
aside
but
the
car
stopped
well
here
is
luck
where
are
you
going
my
pretty
maid
called
a
gay
bold
voice
she
turned
the
speaker
was
one
willis
hubbard
an
automobile
agent
by
profession
lady
man
and
general
lothario
by
avocation
his
handsome
dark
face
stood
out
clearly
in
the
dusk
she
could
see
the
avid
shine
in
his
eyes
she
hated
him
all
of
a
sudden
though
hitherto
she
had
secretly
rather
admired
him
though
she
had
always
steadily
refused
his
invitations
for
madeline
was
wary
she
knew
how
other
girls
had
gone
out
with
willis
in
his
smart
car
and
come
back
to
give
rather
sketchy
accounts
of
the
evening
pleasure
jaunt
her
friend
linda
had
tried
it
once
and
remarked
later
that
willis
was
some
speed
and
that
madeline
had
the
right
hunch
to
keep
away
from
him
but
it
happened
that
madeline
taylor
was
the
particular
peach
that
willis
hubbard
hankered
after
he
did
like
them
too
easy
ready
to
drop
from
the
bough
at
the
first
touch
all
the
same
he
meant
to
have
his
way
in
the
end
with
madeline
he
had
an
excellent
opinion
of
his
powers
as
a
conquering
male
he
had
alas
plenty
of
data
to
warrant
it
in
his
relations
with
the
fair
and
sometimes
weak
sex
what
your
hurry
dearie
he
asked
now
come
on
for
a
spin
it
the
pink
of
the
evening
but
she
thanked
him
stiffly
and
refused
remembering
ted
holiday
honest
blue
eyes
what
are
you
so
almighty
prunes
and
prisms
for
all
of
a
sudden
the
wrong
game
to
play
with
a
man
i
can
tell
you
if
you
want
to
have
a
good
time
in
the
world
i
say
maidie
be
a
good
girl
and
come
out
with
me
night
we
have
dinner
somewhere
and
dance
and
make
a
night
of
it
say
yes
you
beauty
a
girl
like
you
ought
to
stay
cooped
up
at
home
forever
it
against
nature
but
again
madeline
refused
and
moved
away
with
dignity
your
grandfather
will
never
know
you
can
plan
to
stay
with
linda
afterward
i
meet
you
by
the
sycamore
tree
just
beyond
the
place
at
eight
sharp
give
you
the
best
time
you
ever
had
in
your
life
believe
me
i
some
little
spender
when
i
get
to
going
no
thank
you
hubbard
i
tell
you
i
ca
go
he
stared
at
the
finality
of
her
manner
he
had
no
means
of
knowing
that
he
was
being
measured
up
to
his
infinite
disadvantage
with
a
blue
eyed
lad
who
had
stirred
something
in
the
girl
before
him
that
he
himself
could
never
have
roused
in
a
thousand
years
but
he
did
know
he
was
being
snubbed
and
the
knowledge
disturbed
his
fond
conceit
of
self
highty
tighty
with
your
hubbards
you
will
sing
another
tune
by
night
i
wait
at
the
sycamore
and
you
be
there
see
if
you
wo
you
no
fool
maidie
you
want
a
good
time
and
you
know
the
boy
to
give
it
to
you
so
long
see
you
night
he
started
his
motor
kissed
his
hand
impudently
to
her
and
was
off
down
the
road
leaving
madeline
to
follow
slowly
in
his
dust
chapter
vi
a
shadow
on
the
path
across
the
campus
the
ivy
procession
wound
its
lovely
length
flanked
by
rainbow
clad
junior
ushers
immensely
conscious
of
themselves
and
their
importance
as
they
bore
the
looped
laurel
chains
between
which
walked
the
even
more
important
seniors
all
in
white
and
each
bearing
an
american
beauty
rose
before
her
proudly
like
a
wand
of
youth
at
the
head
of
the
procession
as
president
of
the
class
walked
antoinette
holiday
a
little
lady
of
quality
as
none
who
saw
her
could
have
helped
recognizing
her
uncle
watching
the
procession
from
the
steps
of
a
campus
house
smiled
and
sighed
as
he
beheld
her
she
was
so
young
so
so
untouched
by
the
sad
and
sordid
things
of
life
if
only
he
could
keep
her
so
for
a
little
preserve
the
shining
splendor
of
her
shield
of
innocent
young
joy
but
even
as
he
thought
he
knew
the
folly
of
his
wish
tony
would
be
the
last
to
desire
to
have
life
tempered
or
kept
from
her
she
would
want
to
drain
the
whole
cup
bitter
sweet
and
all
farther
back
in
the
procession
was
carlotta
looking
as
heavenly
fair
and
ethereal
as
if
she
had
that
morning
been
wafted
down
from
the
skies
out
of
the
crowd
phil
lambert
eyes
met
hers
and
smiled
very
sensibly
and
modernly
these
two
had
decided
to
remain
the
best
of
friends
since
fate
prevented
their
being
lovers
but
phil
eyes
were
rather
more
than
friendly
resting
on
carlotta
and
underneath
the
diaphanous
exquisite
white
cloud
of
a
gown
that
she
wore
carlotta
heart
beat
a
little
faster
for
what
she
saw
in
his
face
the
hand
that
held
her
rose
trembled
ever
so
slightly
as
she
smiled
bravely
back
at
him
she
could
not
forget
those
very
different
kisses
of
his
nor
with
all
the
will
in
the
world
could
she
go
back
to
where
she
was
before
she
went
up
the
mountain
and
came
down
again
in
the
purple
dusk
she
knew
she
had
to
get
used
to
a
strange
new
world
a
world
without
philip
lambert
a
rather
empty
world
it
seemed
she
wondered
if
this
new
world
would
give
her
anything
so
wonderful
and
sweet
as
this
thing
that
she
had
by
her
own
act
surrendered
almost
she
thought
not
ted
standing
beside
his
uncle
watching
the
procession
suddenly
heard
a
familiar
whistle
a
signal
dating
back
to
holiday
hill
days
as
unmistakable
as
the
star
spangled
banner
itself
though
who
should
be
using
it
here
and
why
was
a
mystery
in
a
moment
his
roving
gaze
discovered
the
solution
standing
upon
a
slight
elevation
on
the
campus
opposite
he
perceived
dick
carson
the
latter
beckoned
peremptorily
ted
wriggled
out
of
the
group
descended
with
one
leap
over
the
rail
to
the
lawn
and
made
his
way
to
where
the
other
youth
waited
what
in
sam
hill
chewing
you
he
demanded
upon
arrival
you
made
me
quit
the
only
spot
i
struck
where
i
had
room
to
stand
on
my
own
feet
and
see
anything
at
the
same
time
i
say
ted
what
train
was
larry
coming
on
counterquestioned
dick
chicago
overland
why
are
you
sure
of
course
i
am
sure
he
wired
tony
what
in
thunder
are
you
driving
at
get
it
out
for
pete
sake
the
chicago
overland
smashed
into
a
freight
somewhere
near
pittsburgh
this
morning
there
were
hundreds
of
people
killed
oh
lord
ted
i
did
mean
to
break
it
to
you
like
that
dick
was
aghast
at
his
own
clumsiness
as
ted
leaned
against
the
brick
wall
of
the
college
building
his
face
white
as
chalk
i
was
thinking
guess
i
was
thinking
about
much
of
anything
except
tony
he
added
ted
groaned
do
wonder
he
muttered
let
not
let
her
get
wind
of
it
till
we
have
to
are
you
sure
there
there
is
any
mistake
ted
put
up
his
hand
to
brush
back
a
refractory
lock
of
hair
and
found
his
forehead
wet
with
cold
perspiration
there
got
to
be
a
mistake
larry
i
believe
it
so
there
you
do
have
to
believe
it
till
you
know
even
if
he
was
on
the
train
it
does
mean
he
is
hurt
dick
would
not
name
the
harsher
possibility
to
larry
holiday
brother
of
course
it
does
snapped
ted
i
say
dick
is
it
in
the
papers
yet
no
it
will
be
in
an
hour
though
as
soon
as
the
evening
editions
get
out
good
dick
it
up
to
you
to
keep
tony
from
knowing
she
is
going
to
sing
in
the
concert
at
five
that
will
keep
her
occupied
until
six
but
from
now
till
then
nix
on
the
news
take
her
out
on
the
fool
pond
walk
her
up
sunset
hill
quarrel
with
her
make
love
to
her
anything
so
she
wo
guess
i
do
dare
go
near
her
i
give
it
away
in
a
minute
such
an
idiot
besides
i
ca
think
of
anything
but
larry
gee
the
boy
swept
his
hand
across
his
eyes
last
time
i
saw
him
i
consigned
him
to
the
devil
because
he
told
me
some
perfectly
true
things
about
myself
and
tried
to
give
me
some
perfectly
sound
advice
and
now
i
damned
if
i
believe
it
larry
is
all
right
he
got
to
be
fiercely
of
course
he
is
soothed
dick
and
i
try
to
do
as
you
say
about
tony
i
not
much
of
an
actor
but
i
guess
i
can
carry
it
through
for
for
her
sake
the
little
break
in
the
speaker
voice
made
ted
turn
quickly
and
stare
at
the
other
youth
dick
old
chap
is
it
like
that
with
you
i
did
know
ted
hand
went
out
and
held
the
other
in
a
cordial
grip
nobody
knows
i
i
did
mean
to
show
it
then
it
no
good
i
know
that
naturally
i
not
so
sure
about
that
i
know
one
member
of
the
family
that
would
be
mighty
proud
to
have
you
for
a
brother
the
obvious
ring
of
sincerity
touched
dick
it
was
a
good
deal
coming
from
a
holiday
thank
you
ted
that
means
a
lot
i
can
tell
you
i
never
forget
your
saying
it
like
that
you
wo
give
me
away
i
know
sure
not
old
man
tony
is
way
up
in
the
clouds
just
now
anyway
we
are
all
mostly
ants
in
our
minor
ant
hills
so
far
as
she
is
concerned
gee
i
hope
it
is
this
thing
about
larry
that
is
going
to
pull
her
down
to
earth
if
anything
had
to
happen
to
any
of
us
why
could
it
have
been
me
instead
of
larry
he
is
worth
ten
of
me
we
do
know
that
anything
has
happened
to
larry
yet
dick
reminded
i
say
ted
they
must
have
got
the
ivy
planted
everybody
coming
back
tony
is
lunching
with
me
at
boyden
right
away
and
i
see
that
she
has
her
hands
full
until
it
is
time
for
the
concert
you
warn
miss
carlotta
so
she
be
on
guard
after
i
surrender
her
i
afraid
you
will
have
to
tell
your
uncle
i
will
trot
on
old
man
and
waylay
tony
i
make
a
mess
of
things
sure
as
preaching
if
i
run
into
her
now
tony
thought
she
had
never
known
dick
to
be
so
entertaining
or
talkative
as
he
was
during
that
luncheon
hour
he
regaled
her
with
all
kinds
of
newspaper
yarns
and
related
some
of
his
own
once
but
now
humorous
misadventures
of
his
early
cub
days
he
talked
too
on
current
events
and
world
history
talked
well
with
the
quiet
poise
and
assurance
of
the
reader
and
thinker
the
man
who
has
kept
his
eyes
and
ears
open
to
life
it
was
a
revelation
to
tony
for
once
their
respective
roles
were
reversed
he
the
talker
she
the
listener
goodness
me
dick
she
exclaimed
during
a
pause
in
what
had
become
almost
a
monologue
why
have
you
ever
talked
like
this
before
i
always
thought
i
had
to
do
it
all
and
here
you
talk
better
than
i
ever
thought
of
doing
because
you
have
something
to
say
and
mine
is
just
chatter
and
nonsense
he
smiled
at
that
i
love
your
chatter
but
you
are
tired
and
it
is
my
turn
do
you
know
what
we
are
going
to
do
after
luncheon
no
what
we
are
going
to
take
a
canoe
out
on
your
paradise
and
get
into
a
shady
spot
somewhere
along
the
bank
and
you
will
lean
back
against
a
whole
lot
of
becoming
cushions
and
put
up
that
red
parasol
of
yours
so
nobody
but
me
can
see
your
face
and
then
dicky
dicky
whatever
is
in
you
paradise
pillows
and
parasols
are
familiar
symptoms
you
will
be
making
love
to
me
next
i
might
at
that
murmured
dick
but
you
did
not
hear
the
rest
of
my
proposition
and
then
i
shall
read
you
a
story
a
story
that
i
wrote
myself
dick
tony
nearly
upset
her
glass
of
iced
tea
in
her
amazement
at
this
unexpected
announcement
you
do
mean
you
have
really
and
truly
written
a
story
honest
to
goodness
such
as
it
is
please
to
remember
it
is
my
maiden
effort
and
make
a
margin
of
allowance
but
i
want
your
criticism
too
all
the
benefit
of
your
superior
academic
training
superior
academic
bosh
scoffed
tony
i
bet
it
is
a
corking
story
she
added
unacademically
come
on
let
go
quick
i
wait
to
hear
it
nothing
loath
to
get
away
speedily
before
the
newsboys
began
to
cry
the
accident
through
the
streets
dick
escorted
his
pretty
companion
back
to
the
campus
and
on
to
paradise
at
which
point
they
took
a
canoe
and
finally
selecting
a
shady
point
under
an
sycamore
tree
drifted
in
to
shore
where
tony
leaned
against
the
cushions
tilted
her
parasol
as
specified
at
the
angle
which
forbade
any
but
dick
to
see
her
charming
expressive
young
face
and
commanded
him
to
shoot
dick
shot
tony
listened
intently
watching
his
face
as
he
read
feeling
as
if
this
were
a
new
dick
a
dick
she
did
not
know
at
all
albeit
a
most
interesting
person
why
dick
carson
she
exclaimed
when
he
finished
it
is
great
a
real
story
with
real
laughter
and
tears
in
it
i
love
it
it
is
so
so
human
the
author
flushed
and
fidgeted
and
protested
that
it
was
much
just
a
sketch
done
from
life
with
a
very
little
dressing
up
and
polishing
down
i
have
a
lot
more
of
them
in
my
head
though
he
added
and
going
to
grind
them
out
as
soon
as
i
get
time
i
wish
i
had
a
bigger
vocabulary
and
knew
more
about
the
technical
end
of
the
writing
game
i
am
going
to
learn
though
going
to
take
some
night
work
at
the
university
next
fall
maybe
i
catch
up
a
little
yet
if
i
keep
pegging
away
catch
up
dick
you
make
me
so
ashamed
here
larry
and
ted
and
i
have
had
everything
done
for
us
all
our
lives
and
we
slipped
along
with
the
current
following
the
line
of
least
resistance
and
you
have
had
everything
to
contend
with
and
you
are
way
ahead
of
the
rest
of
us
already
but
why
did
you
tell
me
before
about
the
story
i
think
you
might
have
dicky
you
know
i
would
be
interested
reproachfully
i
i
was
talking
much
about
it
to
anybody
till
i
knew
it
was
any
good
but
i
just
took
a
notion
to
read
it
to
you
that
all
it
was
all
but
he
wanted
tony
to
think
it
was
not
for
anything
would
he
have
betrayed
how
reading
the
story
was
a
desperate
expedient
to
keep
her
diverted
and
safe
from
news
of
the
disaster
on
the
overland
he
escorted
tony
back
to
the
campus
house
at
the
latest
possible
moment
and
carlotta
in
the
secret
pretended
to
upbraid
her
roommate
for
her
tardiness
and
flew
about
helping
her
to
get
dressed
talking
continuously
the
while
and
keeping
a
sharp
eye
on
the
door
lest
some
intruder
burst
in
and
say
the
very
thing
tony
holiday
must
not
be
permitted
to
hear
it
would
be
so
ridiculously
easy
for
somebody
to
ask
oh
did
you
hear
about
the
awful
wreck
on
the
overland
and
then
the
fat
would
be
in
the
fire
but
thanks
to
carlotta
nobody
had
a
chance
to
say
it
and
later
tony
holiday
standing
in
the
twilight
in
front
of
college
hall
steps
sang
her
solo
gounod
beautiful
ave
maria
smiled
happily
down
into
the
faces
of
the
dear
folks
from
her
beloved
hill
and
only
regretted
that
larry
was
not
there
with
the
rest
larry
who
for
all
the
others
knew
might
never
come
again
after
dinner
ted
rushed
off
again
to
the
telegraph
office
which
he
had
been
haunting
all
the
afternoon
to
see
if
any
word
had
come
from
his
brother
and
doctor
holiday
went
on
up
to
the
campus
to
escort
his
niece
to
the
informal
hop
he
had
decided
to
go
on
just
as
if
nothing
was
wrong
if
larry
was
safe
then
there
was
no
need
of
clouding
tony
joy
and
if
he
was
well
there
would
be
time
enough
to
grieve
when
they
knew
by
virtue
of
his
being
a
grave
and
reverend
uncle
he
was
admitted
to
the
sacred
precincts
of
his
niece
room
and
had
hardly
gotten
seated
when
the
door
flew
open
and
ted
flew
in
waving
two
yellow
telegraph
blanks
triumphantly
one
in
each
hand
and
announcing
that
everything
was
all
right
larry
was
all
right
had
wired
from
pittsburgh
before
tony
had
a
chance
to
demand
what
it
was
all
about
the
door
opened
again
and
a
righteously
indignant
house
mother
appeared
on
the
threshold
demanding
by
what
right
an
unauthorized
male
had
gone
up
her
stairway
and
entered
a
girl
room
without
permission
or
escort
i
apologize
beamed
ted
with
his
most
engaging
smile
come
on
outside
maynerd
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
and
tucking
his
arm
in
hers
the
irrepressible
youth
conveyed
the
angry
personage
out
into
the
hall
leaving
his
uncle
to
explain
the
situation
to
tony
in
a
moment
he
was
back
triumphant
she
says
i
may
stay
since
i
here
and
uncle
phil
is
here
to
play
dragon
he
announced
she
thought
at
first
carlotta
would
have
to
be
expunged
to
make
it
legal
but
i
overruled
her
told
her
you
and
i
had
played
with
each
other
in
our
cradles
he
added
with
an
impish
grin
at
his
sister
roommate
of
course
i
never
laid
eyes
on
you
till
two
years
ago
but
that
does
matter
i
have
a
true
feeling
for
you
anyway
and
that
is
what
counts
it
sweetness
carlotta
laughed
and
averred
that
she
was
going
to
expunge
herself
anyway
as
phil
was
waiting
for
her
downstairs
she
picked
up
a
turquoise
satin
mandarin
cloak
from
the
chair
and
ted
sprang
to
put
it
around
her
bare
shoulders
stooping
to
kiss
the
tip
of
her
ear
as
he
finished
lucky
phil
he
murmured
carlotta
shook
her
head
at
him
and
went
over
to
tony
over
whom
she
bent
for
an
instant
with
unusual
feeling
in
her
lovely
eyes
oh
my
dear
she
whispered
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
how
i
feel
i
so
glad
so
glad
and
then
she
was
gone
before
tony
could
answer
oh
me
she
sighed
she
has
been
so
wonderful
you
all
have
ted
uncle
phil
come
over
here
i
want
to
hold
you
tight
and
with
her
brother
on
one
side
of
her
and
her
uncle
on
the
other
tony
gave
a
hand
to
each
and
for
a
moment
no
one
spoke
then
ted
produced
his
telegrams
one
of
which
was
addressed
to
tony
and
one
to
her
uncle
both
announced
the
young
doctor
safety
staying
over
in
pittsburgh
letter
follows
was
in
the
doctor
message
sorry
ca
make
commencement
love
and
congratulations
was
in
tony
there
did
i
tell
you
he
was
all
right
demanded
ted
as
if
his
brother
safety
were
due
to
his
own
remarkably
good
management
of
the
affair
gee
tony
if
you
knew
how
i
felt
when
dick
told
me
this
morning
i
pretty
nearly
disgraced
myself
by
toppling
over
just
like
a
girl
on
the
campus
lord
it
was
fierce
i
know
tony
squeezed
his
hand
sympathetically
and
dick
why
dick
must
have
kept
me
out
in
paradise
on
purpose
sure
he
did
dick
a
jim
dandy
and
do
you
forget
it
i
sha
said
tony
her
eyes
a
little
misty
remembering
how
dick
had
fought
all
day
to
keep
her
happiness
intact
i
do
know
whether
to
be
angry
at
you
all
for
keeping
it
from
me
or
to
fall
on
your
necks
and
weep
because
you
were
all
so
dear
not
to
tell
me
and
oh
if
anything
had
happened
to
larry
i
do
see
how
i
could
have
stood
it
it
makes
us
all
seem
awfully
near
does
it
you
bet
agreed
ted
with
more
fervor
than
elegance
if
the
old
chap
had
been
done
for
i
have
felt
like
making
for
the
river
myself
funny
now
the
scare
is
over
and
he
is
all
safe
i
shall
probably
cuss
him
out
as
hard
as
ever
next
time
he
tries
to
preach
at
me
you
had
better
listen
to
him
instead
larry
is
apt
to
be
right
and
you
are
apt
to
be
wrong
and
you
know
it
maybe
it
is
because
i
do
know
it
and
because
he
is
so
devilish
right
that
i
damn
him
observed
the
youngest
holiday
sagely
his
eyes
meeting
his
uncle
over
his
sister
head
it
was
until
he
had
danced
and
flirted
and
made
merry
for
three
consecutive
hours
at
the
hop
and
proposed
in
the
exuberance
of
his
mood
to
at
least
three
different
charmers
whose
names
he
had
forgotten
by
the
next
day
that
ted
holiday
remembered
madeline
and
his
promise
to
keep
tryst
with
her
that
afternoon
other
things
of
more
moment
had
swept
her
clean
from
his
mind
thunder
he
muttered
to
himself
wonder
what
she
is
thinking
when
i
swore
by
all
that
was
holy
to
come
oh
well
i
should
worry
i
help
it
i
write
and
explain
how
it
happened
so
said
so
done
he
scribbled
off
a
hasty
note
of
explanation
and
apology
which
he
signed
yours
devotedly
ted
holiday
and
went
out
to
the
corner
mail
box
to
dispatch
the
same
so
it
would
go
out
in
the
early
morning
collection
and
prepared
to
dismiss
the
matter
from
his
mind
again
coming
back
into
his
room
he
found
his
uncle
standing
on
the
threshold
had
to
get
a
letter
off
murmured
the
young
man
as
his
uncle
looked
inquiring
he
turned
to
light
a
cigarette
with
an
air
of
determined
casualness
he
did
care
to
have
uncle
phil
know
any
more
about
the
madeline
affair
it
must
have
been
important
was
curtly
did
you
think
i
was
joy
riding
again
no
i
heard
you
stirring
and
thought
you
might
be
sick
i
have
been
able
to
get
to
sleep
myself
seeing
how
utterly
worn
out
his
uncle
looked
ted
resentment
took
quick
shamed
flight
poor
uncle
phil
he
never
spared
himself
always
bore
the
brunt
of
everything
for
them
all
and
here
he
himself
had
just
snapped
like
a
cur
because
he
suspected
his
guardian
of
desiring
to
interfere
with
his
high
and
mighty
private
business
too
bad
he
said
wish
you
smoke
uncle
phil
it
great
to
cool
off
your
nerves
honest
it
is
have
one
he
held
out
his
case
doctor
holiday
smiled
at
that
though
he
declined
the
proffered
weed
he
understood
very
well
that
the
boy
was
making
tacit
amends
for
his
ungraciousness
of
a
moment
before
no
i
get
to
sleep
presently
it
has
been
rather
a
wearing
day
should
say
it
had
been
i
hope
aunt
margery
does
know
about
the
wreck
she
worry
if
she
knew
larry
was
coming
east
i
wired
her
this
evening
i
did
want
to
take
any
chance
of
her
thinking
he
was
in
the
smash
ted
laid
down
his
cigarette
you
never
forget
anybody
do
you
uncle
phil
he
said
rather
soberly
for
him
i
never
forget
margery
she
is
a
very
part
of
myself
lad
and
when
he
was
alone
ted
pondered
over
that
last
speech
of
his
uncle
he
wondered
if
there
would
ever
be
a
margery
for
him
and
if
so
what
she
would
think
of
the
madelines
if
she
knew
of
them
chapter
vii
developments
by
mail
after
the
family
had
reassembled
on
the
hill
the
promised
letter
from
larry
arrived
he
was
staying
on
so
long
as
his
services
were
needed
the
enormous
number
of
victims
of
the
wreck
had
strained
to
the
uttermost
the
city
supply
of
doctors
and
nurses
and
there
was
more
than
enough
work
for
all
the
writer
spared
them
the
details
of
the
wreck
so
far
as
possible
indeed
evidently
was
not
anxious
to
relive
the
horrors
on
his
own
account
he
mentioned
a
few
of
the
many
sad
cases
only
one
of
these
was
the
instant
death
of
a
famous
surgeon
whose
loss
to
the
world
seemed
tragic
and
pitifully
wasteful
to
the
young
doctor
another
was
the
crushing
to
death
of
a
young
mother
who
with
her
two
children
had
been
happily
on
their
way
to
meet
the
husband
who
had
been
in
south
america
for
a
year
larry
had
made
friends
with
her
on
the
train
and
played
with
the
babies
who
reminded
him
of
his
small
cousins
eric
and
hester
doctor
philip
children
a
third
case
he
went
into
more
fully
that
of
a
young
woman
just
a
mere
girl
in
appearance
though
she
wore
a
wedding
ring
who
had
received
a
terrible
blow
on
the
base
of
her
brain
which
had
driven
out
memory
entirely
she
did
not
know
who
she
was
where
she
was
going
or
whence
she
had
come
her
physical
injuries
otherwise
were
not
serious
a
broken
arm
and
some
bad
bruises
nothing
but
what
she
would
easily
recover
from
in
a
short
time
but
for
all
her
effort
the
past
remained
as
something
on
the
other
side
of
a
strange
blank
wall
she
tries
pitifully
hard
to
remember
and
is
so
sweet
and
brave
we
are
all
devoted
to
her
i
always
stop
and
talk
to
her
when
i
go
by
her
she
seems
to
cling
to
me
rather
as
if
i
could
help
her
get
things
back
lord
knows
i
wish
i
could
she
is
too
dainty
and
fragile
a
morsel
of
humanity
to
be
left
to
fight
such
a
thing
alone
she
is
a
regular
little
dresden
shepherdess
with
the
tiniest
feet
and
hands
and
the
yellowest
hair
and
bluest
eyes
i
ever
saw
her
husband
must
be
about
crazy
poor
chap
not
hearing
from
her
i
suppose
he
will
be
turning
up
soon
to
claim
her
i
hope
so
i
do
know
what
will
become
of
her
if
he
does
not
it
is
late
and
i
must
turn
in
i
do
know
when
i
shall
get
home
i
do
flatter
myself
dunbury
will
miss
me
much
when
it
has
you
give
everybody
my
love
and
tell
tony
i
am
awfully
sorry
i
could
get
to
commencement
i
guess
maybe
she
is
glad
enough
to
have
me
alive
not
to
mind
much
i
some
glad
to
be
alive
myself
the
letter
ended
with
affectionate
greetings
to
the
older
doctor
from
his
nephew
and
junior
assistant
with
it
came
another
epistle
from
the
same
city
from
an
old
doctor
friend
who
had
watched
philip
holiday
himself
grow
up
and
had
immediately
set
his
eye
on
the
younger
holiday
when
he
had
discovered
the
relationship
you
have
a
lad
to
be
proud
of
in
that
larry
of
yours
he
wrote
he
is
on
the
job
early
and
late
no
smart
alecness
no
shirking
no
fool
questions
just
there
on
the
spot
when
you
want
him
with
cool
head
steady
nerves
and
a
hand
as
gentle
as
a
woman
i
like
his
quality
phil
quality
shows
up
at
a
time
like
this
he
is
true
holiday
through
and
through
and
you
can
tell
him
i
said
so
when
you
see
him
the
doctor
smiled
well
pleased
at
this
tribute
to
ned
son
and
this
letter
like
larry
he
handed
to
his
wife
margery
to
read
the
thirties
had
touched
miss
margery
lightly
she
was
still
slim
and
in
her
simple
gown
of
that
forgetmenot
blue
shade
which
her
husband
particularly
loved
she
seemed
scarcely
older
than
she
had
on
that
day
some
eight
years
earlier
when
he
had
found
her
giving
a
fourth
of
july
party
to
the
hill
youngsters
and
had
begun
to
lose
his
heart
to
her
then
and
there
it
was
not
by
shedding
care
and
responsibility
however
that
she
had
kept
her
youth
it
was
by
no
means
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
be
a
busy
doctor
wife
the
mother
of
two
lively
children
and
faithful
daughter
to
an
invalid
and
rather
difficult
as
well
as
to
care
for
a
big
house
and
an
elastic
household
which
in
vacation
time
included
ned
holiday
children
and
their
friends
needless
to
say
she
did
not
do
any
painting
these
days
but
there
is
more
than
one
way
of
being
an
artist
and
of
the
art
of
simple
lovely
human
living
margery
holiday
was
past
mistress
does
sound
much
like
larry
these
days
does
it
she
commented
giving
the
letters
back
to
her
husband
i
know
you
are
proud
of
doctor
fenton
letter
phil
you
ought
to
be
it
is
more
than
a
little
due
to
you
that
larry
is
what
he
is
we
are
advertised
by
our
loving
wives
he
misquoted
teasingly
i
have
always
observed
that
the
things
we
approve
of
in
the
younger
generation
are
the
fruit
of
seeds
we
planted
the
things
we
disapprove
of
slipped
in
inadvertedly
like
weeds
the
same
mail
that
brought
larry
letter
brought
one
also
to
ted
from
madeline
taylor
a
letter
which
made
him
wriggle
a
little
internally
and
pull
his
forelock
as
was
his
habit
when
things
were
a
bit
perturbing
madeline
had
gone
to
bed
that
sunday
night
after
her
meeting
with
ted
in
the
woods
full
of
the
happiest
kind
of
anticipations
and
shy
foolish
impossible
dreams
her
mind
told
her
it
was
the
rankest
of
nonsense
to
dream
about
ted
holiday
but
her
heart
would
do
it
she
knew
the
affair
with
ted
had
begun
wrong
but
she
could
help
hoping
it
would
come
out
beautifully
right
she
could
help
making
believe
she
had
found
her
prince
a
bonny
laddie
who
liked
her
well
enough
to
play
straight
with
her
and
to
come
again
to
see
her
she
meant
to
try
so
hard
so
very
hard
to
make
herself
into
the
kind
of
girl
he
was
used
to
and
liked
she
cut
out
the
picture
of
tony
holiday
that
max
hempel
and
dick
carson
had
studied
that
day
on
the
train
she
studied
it
even
harder
and
hid
it
away
among
her
very
special
treasures
where
she
could
take
it
out
and
look
at
it
often
and
use
it
as
a
model
she
even
snatched
her
hitherto
precious
earrings
from
their
pink
cotton
resting
place
and
hurled
them
as
far
as
she
could
into
the
night
she
was
very
sure
tony
holiday
did
not
wear
earrings
and
she
was
even
surer
she
had
seen
ted
eyes
resting
disapprovingly
on
hers
the
earrings
had
to
go
they
had
gone
the
next
afternoon
she
had
waited
for
a
while
patiently
by
the
brook
the
distant
clock
struck
the
half
hour
the
three
quarters
the
full
hour
no
ted
holiday
by
this
time
her
patience
had
long
since
evaporated
and
now
blazed
into
blind
rage
ted
had
forgotten
his
promise
if
indeed
he
had
ever
meant
to
keep
it
he
was
with
those
other
girls
his
kind
maybe
he
was
laughing
at
her
telling
them
how
easy
she
had
been
how
gullible
no
he
would
he
would
be
ashamed
to
admit
he
had
had
anything
to
do
with
her
men
did
not
boast
of
their
conquest
of
one
kind
of
girl
to
another
she
had
read
enough
fiction
to
know
that
in
any
case
she
hated
ted
holiday
with
a
fine
fury
of
resentment
she
wanted
to
make
him
suffer
even
as
she
was
suffering
though
she
sensed
vaguely
that
men
could
suffer
that
way
it
was
only
women
who
were
capable
of
such
torture
men
went
free
from
her
rage
against
her
recreant
cavalier
she
went
on
to
rage
against
life
built
on
a
plan
for
the
benefit
of
man
women
were
hurt
no
matter
what
they
did
being
good
was
any
use
you
got
hurt
all
the
worse
if
you
were
good
it
was
silly
even
to
try
it
was
better
to
shut
your
eyes
and
have
a
good
time
pursuing
this
reasoning
brought
madeline
taylor
to
the
sycamore
tree
that
night
where
willis
hubbard
car
waited
she
went
with
willis
not
to
please
him
not
to
please
herself
but
to
spite
ted
holiday
she
had
hinted
to
ted
she
would
do
something
desperate
if
he
failed
her
she
had
done
something
desperate
but
it
was
herself
not
ted
that
had
been
hurt
she
discovered
that
too
late
the
next
morning
had
brought
ted
pleasant
penitent
note
explaining
his
defection
and
expressing
the
hope
that
they
might
meet
again
soon
signed
hers
devotedly
poor
madeline
the
cup
of
her
regret
was
very
bitter
to
the
taste
as
she
read
that
letter
of
ted
holiday
something
of
her
misery
and
crept
into
the
letter
to
ted
together
with
a
passionate
remorse
for
having
doubted
him
and
her
even
more
vehement
regret
for
having
gone
out
with
willis
hubbard
the
whole
complex
story
of
her
emotional
reactions
was
of
course
not
written
down
for
ted
eyes
but
he
read
quite
enough
to
permit
him
to
guess
more
than
he
cared
to
know
hubbard
was
evidently
something
of
a
rotter
maybe
he
was
a
bit
of
a
rotter
himself
if
he
had
taken
the
girl
out
joy
riding
himself
she
would
have
gone
with
the
other
two
nights
later
that
was
plain
to
be
seen
with
half
an
eye
and
ted
holiday
was
man
enough
to
look
at
the
fact
straight
and
unblinking
for
a
moment
well
he
should
worry
it
was
his
fault
if
madeline
had
been
fool
enough
to
go
out
with
hubbard
when
she
knew
what
kind
of
a
chap
he
was
he
was
her
keeper
he
did
see
why
she
had
to
ask
him
to
forgive
her
it
was
none
of
his
business
and
he
wished
she
had
begged
so
earnestly
and
humbly
that
he
would
see
her
again
soon
he
did
want
to
see
her
yet
down
underneath
ted
holiday
had
an
uneasy
feeling
he
ought
to
want
it
ought
to
try
to
make
up
to
her
in
some
way
for
something
which
was
somehow
his
fault
even
though
he
did
disclaim
the
responsibility
two
days
later
came
another
letter
even
more
disturbing
it
seemed
madeline
was
going
to
holyoke
again
soon
to
visit
her
cousin
emma
and
wanted
ted
to
join
her
she
was
dying
to
see
him
he
could
stay
at
cousin
emma
but
maybe
he
would
like
that
because
there
was
a
raft
of
children
always
under
foot
and
fred
emma
husband
was
a
dreadful
ordinary
person
who
smoked
a
smelly
pipe
and
sat
round
in
his
shirt
sleeves
but
if
he
would
come
and
stay
at
a
hotel
they
could
have
a
wonderful
time
she
did
want
to
see
him
so
much
besides
willis
pestered
her
all
the
time
and
said
if
she
went
away
he
would
come
down
in
his
car
every
night
to
see
her
so
if
ted
did
want
her
to
run
around
with
willis
as
he
said
in
his
last
letter
he
had
better
come
himself
she
did
like
willis
the
way
she
did
ted
though
some
ways
she
hated
him
and
she
wished
awfully
she
had
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
him
and
finally
she
liked
ted
better
than
anybody
in
the
world
and
would
he
please
please
come
to
holyoke
because
she
wanted
him
to
so
very
very
much
and
then
the
postscript
the
cut
is
going
to
leave
a
scar
i
am
most
sure
i
do
care
i
like
it
it
makes
me
think
of
you
and
what
a
wonderful
time
we
had
together
that
night
ted
read
the
letter
coming
up
the
hill
and
for
once
forebore
to
whistle
as
he
made
the
ascent
his
mind
was
busy
a
week
of
dunbury
calm
and
sweet
had
sufficed
to
make
him
undeniably
restless
proposal
struck
him
as
rather
a
jolly
idea
accordingly
after
all
she
was
a
dandy
little
girl
and
he
owed
her
a
lot
for
not
making
any
fuss
over
his
nearly
killing
her
he
did
like
this
hubbard
fellow
either
he
rather
thought
it
was
his
duty
to
go
and
send
him
about
his
business
ted
was
a
bit
of
a
knight
at
heart
and
felt
now
the
chivalric
urge
combining
with
others
less
unselfish
to
go
to
the
rescue
of
the
damsel
and
set
her
free
of
the
false
besieger
her
undisguised
admission
of
her
caring
for
him
was
a
bit
disconcerting
although
perhaps
also
a
little
sweet
to
his
youthful
male
vanity
her
caring
was
a
complication
made
him
feel
as
if
somehow
he
ought
to
make
up
to
her
for
failing
her
in
the
big
thing
by
granting
her
the
smaller
favor
by
the
time
he
had
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
he
was
rather
definitely
committed
in
his
own
mind
to
the
holyoke
trip
if
he
could
throw
enough
dust
in
his
uncle
eyes
to
get
away
with
it
arrived
at
the
house
he
flung
the
other
mail
on
the
hall
table
and
went
upstairs
as
he
passed
his
grandmother
room
he
noticed
that
the
door
was
ajar
and
stepped
in
for
a
word
with
her
she
looked
very
still
and
white
as
she
lay
there
in
the
big
old
fashioned
bed
poor
granny
it
was
awfully
sad
to
be
old
ted
could
quite
imagine
it
for
himself
somehow
granny
dear
he
greeted
stooping
to
kiss
the
withered
old
cheek
how
goes
it
about
as
usual
dear
any
word
from
larry
there
was
a
plaintive
note
in
madame
holiday
voice
she
was
never
quite
content
unless
all
the
children
were
under
the
family
and
larry
was
particularly
dear
to
her
heart
yes
i
just
brought
a
letter
for
uncle
phil
the
very
idea
of
your
wanting
larry
when
you
have
tony
and
me
and
you
have
had
us
for
so
long
ted
pretended
to
be
reproachful
and
his
grandmother
reached
for
his
hand
i
know
dear
boy
i
am
very
glad
to
have
you
and
tony
but
larry
is
a
habit
like
philip
you
must
mind
my
missing
him
course
i
do
mind
granny
i
was
just
jossing
i
do
blame
you
a
bit
for
missing
larry
he
is
a
mighty
good
thing
to
have
in
the
family
wish
i
were
half
as
valuable
you
are
sonny
i
am
so
happy
to
be
having
you
here
all
summer
maybe
not
quite
all
summer
i
be
going
off
for
little
trips
he
prepared
her
gently
youth
youth
never
still
always
wanting
to
fly
off
somewhere
we
all
fly
back
mighty
quick
comforted
ted
there
come
the
kiddies
a
patter
of
small
feet
sounded
down
the
hall
in
the
next
moment
they
were
there
sturdy
eric
the
six
year
old
incredibly
energetic
already
bidding
fair
to
equal
if
not
to
rival
his
cousin
reputation
for
juvenile
naughtiness
and
hester
two
years
younger
a
creation
cherubic
adorable
with
bobbing
silver
curls
delectably
dimpled
elbows
and
corn
flower
blue
eyes
fresh
from
the
tub
and
the
daily
delightful
frolic
with
daddy
they
now
appeared
for
that
other
ceremonial
known
as
saying
to
granny
teddy
teddy
ride
us
to
granny
demanded
eric
hilariously
jubilant
at
finding
his
favorite
tall
cousin
on
the
spot
wide
us
wide
us
chimed
in
hester
not
to
be
outdone
you
fiends
but
ted
obediently
got
down
on
all
fours
while
the
small
folks
clambered
up
on
his
back
and
he
rode
them
over
to
the
bed
their
bathrobes
flying
as
they
went
arrived
at
the
destination
ted
deftly
deposited
his
load
in
a
giggling
squirming
heap
on
the
rug
and
then
gathering
up
the
small
hester
swung
her
aloft
bringing
her
down
with
her
rose
bud
of
a
mouth
close
to
granny
pale
cheeks
kiss
your
flying
angel
granny
before
she
flies
away
again
me
me
clamored
eric
vociferously
hugging
ted
knees
me
flying
angel
too
not
much
objected
ted
no
angel
about
you
too
too
much
solid
flesh
and
bones
kiss
granny
quick
i
hear
your
parents
approaching
philip
and
margery
appeared
on
the
threshold
seeking
their
obstreperous
offspring
there
was
another
stampede
this
time
in
the
direction
of
the
parents
me
me
daddy
chirruped
hester
no
me
ride
me
insisted
eric
such
children
smiled
margery
ted
you
encourage
them
they
are
more
barbarian
than
ever
when
you
are
here
and
they
are
bad
enough
under
normal
conditions
ted
chuckled
at
that
he
and
his
aunt
margery
were
the
best
of
good
friends
they
always
had
been
since
ted
had
refused
to
join
her
round
table
on
the
grounds
that
he
might
have
to
be
sorry
for
being
bad
if
he
did
though
he
had
subsequently
capitulated
in
view
of
the
manifest
advantages
accruing
to
membership
in
the
order
that
right
lay
it
to
me
i
do
believe
uncle
phil
was
a
saint
either
was
he
granny
he
appealed
i
bet
the
kids
get
some
of
their
deviltry
by
direct
line
of
descent
his
grandmother
smiled
we
forget
a
good
deal
about
our
children
naughtinesses
when
they
are
grown
up
she
said
i
even
forgotten
some
of
yours
teddy
lucky
grinned
her
grandson
stooping
to
kiss
her
again
later
when
the
obstreperous
ones
were
in
bed
and
everything
quiet
philip
and
margery
sat
together
in
the
hammock
lovers
still
after
eight
years
of
strenuous
married
life
and
discussed
larry
last
letter
which
had
contained
the
rather
astonishing
request
that
he
be
permitted
to
bring
the
little
lady
who
had
forgotten
her
past
to
holiday
hill
with
him
queer
proposition
murmured
the
doctor
does
sound
like
sober
larry
i
am
not
so
sure
there
is
a
quixotic
streak
in
him
in
all
you
holidays
for
that
matter
you
ca
say
much
think
of
the
stray
boys
you
have
taken
in
at
one
time
or
another
some
of
them
rather
dubious
specimens
i
infer
margery
eyes
smiled
tender
raillery
at
her
husband
he
chuckled
at
the
arraignment
and
admitted
its
justice
still
boys
were
not
mystery
ladies
she
must
grant
him
that
then
he
sobered
it
is
only
you
that
makes
me
hesitate
margery
mine
you
are
carrying
about
as
heavy
a
burden
now
as
any
one
woman
ought
to
take
upon
herself
with
me
and
the
house
and
the
children
and
granny
and
here
is
this
crazy
nephew
of
mine
proposing
the
addition
to
the
family
of
a
stranger
who
has
any
past
and
whose
future
seems
wrapped
mostly
in
a
nebular
hypothesis
it
is
rather
a
large
order
my
dear
not
too
large
it
is
as
if
she
were
seriously
ill
or
would
be
a
burden
in
any
way
besides
it
is
larry
home
as
well
as
ours
and
he
so
seldom
asks
anything
for
himself
and
is
always
ready
to
help
anywhere
do
you
really
mind
her
coming
phil
not
if
you
do
i
am
glad
to
agree
if
it
is
not
going
to
be
too
hard
for
you
as
you
say
larry
does
ever
ask
much
for
himself
and
i
am
interested
in
the
case
anyway
shall
we
wire
him
to
bring
her
then
please
do
i
shall
be
very
glad
you
are
a
wonder
margery
mine
and
the
doctor
bent
and
kissed
his
wife
before
going
in
to
telephone
the
message
to
be
sent
his
nephew
that
night
a
message
bidding
him
and
the
little
stranger
welcome
whenever
they
cared
to
come
to
the
house
on
the
hill
and
far
away
in
pittsburgh
larry
got
the
word
that
night
and
smiled
content
bless
uncle
phil
and
aunt
margery
they
never
failed
you
no
matter
what
you
asked
of
them
chapter
viii
the
little
lady
who
forgot
larry
holiday
was
a
rather
startlingly
energetic
person
when
he
once
got
under
way
the
next
morning
he
overruled
the
mystery
lady
faint
demurs
successfully
argued
the
senior
doctor
into
agreement
with
his
somewhat
surprising
plan
of
procedure
wired
his
uncle
engaged
train
reservations
for
that
evening
secured
a
nurse
preempted
the
services
of
a
red
cap
who
promised
to
be
waiting
with
a
chair
at
the
station
so
that
the
little
invalid
would
not
have
to
set
foot
upon
the
ground
and
finally
carried
the
latter
with
his
own
strong
young
arms
onto
the
train
and
into
a
large
cool
stateroom
where
a
fan
was
already
whirring
and
the
nurse
waiting
to
minister
to
the
needs
of
the
frail
traveler
in
a
few
moments
the
train
was
slipping
smoothly
out
of
the
station
and
the
girl
who
had
forgotten
most
things
else
knew
that
she
was
being
spirited
off
to
a
delightful
sounding
place
called
holiday
hill
in
the
charge
of
a
young
doctor
who
had
made
himself
personally
responsible
for
her
from
the
moment
he
had
extricated
her
more
dead
than
alive
from
the
wreckage
somehow
for
the
moment
she
was
quite
content
with
the
knowledge
leaving
his
charge
in
the
nurse
care
larry
holiday
ensconced
himself
in
his
seat
not
far
from
the
stateroom
and
pretended
to
read
his
paper
but
it
might
just
as
well
have
been
printed
in
ancient
sanscrit
for
all
the
meaning
its
words
conveyed
to
his
brain
his
corporeal
self
occupied
the
green
plush
seat
his
spiritual
person
was
elsewhere
after
fifteen
minutes
of
futile
effort
at
concentration
he
flung
down
the
paper
and
strode
to
the
door
of
the
stateroom
a
white
linen
arm
answered
his
gentle
knock
there
was
a
moment
consultation
then
the
nurse
came
out
and
larry
went
in
on
the
couch
the
girl
lay
very
still
with
eyes
her
long
blonde
braids
tied
with
blue
ribbons
lay
on
the
pillow
on
either
side
of
her
sweet
pale
little
face
making
it
look
more
childlike
than
ever
i
ca
see
why
i
ca
remember
she
said
to
larry
as
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
other
cot
opposite
her
i
try
so
hard
do
try
you
are
just
wearing
yourself
out
doing
it
it
will
be
all
right
in
time
do
worry
i
ca
help
worrying
it
is
oh
it
is
horrible
not
to
have
any
past
to
be
different
from
everybody
in
the
world
i
know
it
is
mighty
tough
and
you
have
been
wonderfully
brave
about
it
but
truly
i
do
believe
it
will
all
come
back
and
in
the
meanwhile
you
are
going
to
one
of
the
best
places
in
the
world
to
get
well
in
take
my
word
for
it
but
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
going
it
is
as
if
i
had
any
claim
on
you
or
your
people
why
are
you
taking
me
to
your
home
the
blue
eyes
were
wide
open
now
and
looking
straight
up
into
larry
gray
ones
larry
smiled
and
larry
smile
coming
out
of
the
usual
gravity
and
repose
of
his
face
was
irresistible
more
than
one
young
woman
case
and
had
wished
seeing
that
smile
that
its
owner
had
eyes
for
girls
as
such
because
you
are
the
most
interesting
patient
i
ever
had
do
begrudge
it
to
me
i
get
measles
and
sore
throats
mostly
do
you
wonder
i
snatched
you
as
a
dog
grabs
a
bone
then
he
sobered
truly
ruth
you
do
mind
my
calling
you
that
do
you
since
we
do
know
your
other
name
the
hill
is
the
one
place
in
the
world
for
you
just
now
you
will
forgive
my
kidnapping
you
when
you
see
it
and
my
people
you
ca
help
liking
it
and
them
i
am
not
afraid
of
not
liking
it
or
them
if
she
had
meant
to
say
if
they
are
at
all
like
you
but
that
seemed
a
little
too
personal
to
say
to
one
doctor
even
a
doctor
who
had
saved
your
life
and
had
the
most
wonderful
smile
that
ever
was
and
the
nicest
eyes
if
they
will
let
me
she
substituted
but
it
is
such
a
queer
kind
thing
to
do
the
other
doctors
were
interested
in
me
too
as
a
case
but
it
did
occur
to
any
of
them
to
offer
me
the
hospitality
of
their
homes
and
family
for
an
unlimited
time
are
you
holidays
all
like
that
more
or
less
admitted
larry
with
another
smile
maybe
we
are
a
bit
about
holiday
hospitality
it
is
rather
a
family
tradition
the
house
on
the
hill
has
had
open
doors
ever
since
the
first
holiday
built
it
nearly
two
hundred
years
ago
you
saw
uncle
phil
wire
he
meant
that
ready
you
see
but
anyway
it
wo
be
very
hard
for
them
to
open
the
door
to
you
they
will
all
love
you
she
shut
her
eyes
again
at
that
possibly
the
young
doctor
expression
was
rather
more
eloquent
than
he
knew
tired
he
asked
not
much
tired
of
wondering
maybe
my
name
is
ruth
at
all
maybe
it
is
but
it
is
a
name
anyway
and
you
may
as
well
use
it
for
the
present
until
you
can
find
your
own
i
think
ruth
annersley
is
a
pretty
name
myself
added
the
young
doctor
seriously
i
like
it
geoffrey
annersley
corrected
the
girl
that
is
rather
pretty
too
larry
agreed
somewhat
less
enthusiastically
ruth
lifted
her
hand
and
fell
to
twisting
the
wedding
ring
which
was
very
loose
on
her
thin
little
finger
think
of
being
married
and
not
knowing
what
your
husband
looks
like
poor
geoffrey
annersley
i
wonder
if
he
cares
a
great
deal
for
me
it
is
quite
possible
said
larry
holiday
grimly
he
had
taken
an
absurd
dislike
to
the
very
name
of
geoffrey
annersley
why
did
the
man
appear
and
claim
his
wife
practically
every
paper
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
had
advertised
for
him
if
he
was
any
good
and
wanted
to
find
his
wife
he
would
be
half
crazy
looking
for
her
by
this
time
he
must
have
seen
the
newspaper
notices
there
was
something
queer
about
this
geoffrey
annersley
larry
holiday
detested
him
cordially
you
do
suppose
he
was
killed
in
the
wreck
do
you
ruth
mind
worked
on
trying
to
put
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
together
you
were
traveling
alone
your
chair
was
near
mine
i
noticed
you
because
i
thought
he
broke
off
abruptly
thought
what
that
you
were
the
prettiest
girl
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
he
admitted
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
two
or
three
times
i
was
on
the
verge
of
it
but
i
never
could
quite
get
up
the
courage
i
not
much
good
at
starting
conversations
with
girls
my
kid
brother
ted
has
the
monopoly
of
that
sort
of
thing
in
my
family
oh
if
you
only
had
she
sighed
maybe
i
would
have
told
you
something
about
myself
and
where
i
was
going
when
i
got
to
new
york
i
wish
i
had
regretted
larry
confound
my
shyness
i
do
see
why
anybody
ever
let
you
travel
alone
from
san
francisco
to
new
york
anyway
he
added
your
geoffrey
ought
to
have
taken
better
care
of
you
maybe
i
have
a
geoffrey
the
fact
that
there
was
an
envelope
in
my
bag
addressed
to
geoffrey
annersley
does
prove
that
i
am
geoffrey
annersley
no
still
there
is
the
ring
larry
frowned
thoughtfully
if
you
geoffrey
annersley
you
must
be
somebody
else
i
suppose
and
the
locket
says
from
oh
yes
i
suppose
i
am
geoffrey
annersley
it
seems
as
if
i
must
be
but
why
ca
i
remember
it
seems
as
if
any
one
would
remember
the
man
she
was
married
to
as
if
one
could
forget
that
no
matter
what
happened
but
if
there
is
a
geoffrey
annersley
why
does
he
come
and
get
me
and
make
me
remember
him
larry
shook
his
head
do
worry
please
we
keep
on
advertising
he
is
bound
to
come
before
long
if
he
really
is
your
husband
some
day
he
will
be
coming
up
our
hill
and
run
away
with
you
worse
luck
ruth
eyes
were
on
the
ring
again
it
is
funny
she
said
but
i
ca
make
myself
married
i
make
the
ring
mean
anything
to
me
i
do
want
it
to
mean
anything
i
do
want
to
be
married
sometimes
i
dream
that
geoffrey
annersley
has
come
and
i
put
my
hand
over
my
eyes
because
i
do
want
to
see
him
is
that
dreadful
she
turned
to
larry
to
ask
you
ca
help
it
larry
tried
manfully
to
push
back
his
own
wholly
unreasonable
satisfaction
in
her
aversion
to
her
presumptive
husband
it
is
the
blow
and
the
shock
of
the
whole
thing
it
will
be
all
right
in
time
you
will
fall
on
your
geoffrey
neck
and
call
him
blessed
when
the
time
comes
i
do
believe
he
is
coming
she
announced
suddenly
with
conviction
larry
got
up
and
walked
over
to
her
couch
what
makes
you
say
that
he
demanded
i
do
know
it
was
just
a
feeling
i
had
something
inside
me
said
right
out
loud
is
coming
he
is
your
husband
maybe
it
is
because
i
do
want
him
to
come
and
do
want
him
to
be
my
husband
oh
dear
it
is
all
so
queer
and
mixed
up
and
horrid
it
is
awful
not
to
be
anybody
just
a
ghost
i
wish
i
been
killed
why
did
you
leave
me
why
did
you
dig
me
out
all
the
others
said
i
was
dead
why
did
you
let
me
dead
it
would
have
been
better
she
turned
her
face
away
and
buried
it
in
the
pillow
sobbing
softly
suddenly
like
a
child
this
was
too
much
for
larry
he
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
her
and
put
his
arms
around
the
quivering
little
figure
do
ruth
he
implored
do
cry
and
do
do
wish
you
were
dead
i
i
ca
stand
it
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
larry
got
to
his
feet
in
guilty
haste
and
went
to
the
door
of
the
stateroom
it
is
time
for
annersley
medicine
announced
the
nurse
impersonally
entering
and
going
over
to
the
wash
stand
for
a
glass
the
white
linen
back
safely
turned
larry
gave
one
swift
look
at
ruth
and
bolted
shutting
the
door
behind
him
the
nurse
turned
to
look
at
the
patient
whose
face
was
still
hidden
in
the
pillow
and
then
her
gaze
traveled
meditatively
toward
the
door
out
of
which
the
young
doctor
had
shot
so
precipitately
larry
had
forgotten
that
there
was
a
mirror
over
the
wash
stand
and
that
nurses
however
impersonal
are
still
women
with
eyes
in
their
heads
h
m
reflected
the
onlooker
i
would
have
thought
he
was
that
kind
you
never
can
tell
about
men
especially
doctors
i
wish
him
joy
falling
in
love
with
a
woman
who
does
know
whether
or
not
she
has
a
husband
your
tablets
annersley
she
added
aloud
larry
i
think
your
ruth
is
the
dearest
thing
i
ever
laid
eyes
on
declared
tony
next
day
to
her
brother
her
name
ought
to
be
titania
not
very
big
myself
but
i
feel
like
an
amazon
beside
her
and
her
laugh
is
the
sweetest
thing
so
soft
and
silvery
like
little
bells
but
she
does
laugh
much
does
she
poor
little
thing
she
is
awfully
up
against
it
said
larry
with
troubled
eyes
she
stop
trying
to
remember
it
is
a
regular
obsession
with
her
and
she
is
very
shy
and
sensitive
and
afraid
of
strangers
she
does
look
at
you
as
if
you
were
a
stranger
she
adores
you
nonsense
said
larry
sharply
tony
opened
her
eyes
at
her
brother
tone
why
larry
of
course
i
did
mean
she
was
in
love
with
you
she
could
be
when
she
is
married
i
just
meant
she
adored
you
well
the
way
max
adores
me
she
explained
as
the
irish
setter
came
and
rested
his
head
on
her
knee
raising
solemn
worshipful
brown
eyes
to
her
face
why
should
she
you
saved
her
life
and
you
have
been
wonderful
to
her
every
way
nonsense
said
larry
again
though
he
said
it
in
a
different
tone
this
time
i
have
done
much
it
is
uncle
phil
and
aunt
margery
who
are
the
wonderful
ones
it
is
great
the
way
they
both
said
yes
right
away
when
i
asked
if
i
could
bring
her
here
i
tell
you
tony
it
means
something
to
have
your
own
people
the
kind
you
can
count
on
every
time
and
it
is
great
to
have
a
home
like
this
to
bring
her
to
she
is
going
to
love
it
as
soon
as
she
is
able
to
get
downstairs
with
us
all
up
in
her
cool
spacious
north
chamber
lying
in
the
big
bed
with
the
smooth
fine
linen
ruth
felt
as
if
she
loved
it
already
though
she
found
these
holidays
even
more
amazing
than
ever
now
that
she
was
actually
in
their
midst
were
there
any
other
people
in
the
world
like
them
she
wondered
so
kind
and
simple
and
unfeignedly
glad
to
take
a
stranger
into
their
home
and
a
queer
mysterious
sick
stranger
at
that
if
i
have
to
begin
living
all
over
just
like
a
baby
i
think
i
am
the
luckiest
girl
that
ever
was
to
be
able
to
start
in
a
place
like
this
with
such
dear
kind
people
all
around
me
she
told
doctor
holiday
senior
to
whom
she
had
immediately
lost
her
heart
as
soon
as
she
saw
his
smile
and
felt
the
touch
of
his
strong
magnetic
healing
hand
we
will
get
you
out
under
the
trees
in
a
day
or
two
he
said
and
then
your
business
will
be
to
get
well
and
strong
as
soon
as
possible
and
not
worry
about
anything
any
more
than
if
you
were
the
baby
you
were
just
talking
about
can
you
manage
that
young
lady
i
try
i
would
be
horrid
and
ungrateful
not
to
when
you
are
all
so
good
to
me
i
do
believe
my
own
people
are
half
as
nice
as
you
holidays
i
do
see
how
they
could
be
the
doctor
laughed
at
that
we
will
let
it
go
at
that
for
the
present
you
will
be
singing
another
tune
when
your
geoffrey
annersley
comes
up
the
hill
to
claim
you
the
girl
expressive
face
clouded
over
at
that
she
did
not
quite
dare
to
tell
doctor
holiday
as
she
had
his
nephew
that
she
did
not
want
to
see
geoffrey
annersley
nor
to
have
to
know
she
was
married
to
him
it
sounded
horrid
but
it
was
true
sometimes
she
hated
the
very
thought
of
geoffrey
annersley
later
doctor
holiday
and
his
nephew
went
over
the
girl
case
together
from
both
the
personal
and
professional
angles
there
was
little
enough
to
go
on
in
untangling
her
mystery
the
railway
tickets
which
had
been
found
in
her
purse
were
in
an
envelope
bearing
the
name
geoffrey
annersley
but
no
address
the
baggage
train
had
been
destroyed
by
fire
at
the
time
of
the
accident
so
there
were
no
trunks
to
give
evidence
the
small
traveling
bag
she
had
carried
with
her
bore
neither
initial
nor
geographical
designation
and
contained
nothing
which
gave
any
clew
as
to
its
owner
identity
save
that
she
was
presumably
a
person
of
wealth
for
her
possessions
were
exquisite
and
obviously
costly
a
small
jewel
box
contained
various
valuable
rings
one
or
two
pendants
and
a
string
of
matched
pearls
which
even
to
uninitiated
eyes
spelled
a
fortune
also
oddly
enough
among
the
rest
was
an
absurd
little
childish
gold
locket
inscribed
ruth
from
geoffrey
she
had
worn
no
rings
at
all
except
for
a
single
and
very
perfect
diamond
and
a
plain
gold
band
obviously
a
wedding
ring
the
inference
was
that
she
was
married
and
that
her
husband
name
was
geoffrey
annersley
but
where
he
was
and
why
she
was
traveling
across
the
united
states
alone
and
from
whence
she
had
come
remained
utterly
unguessable
larry
had
seen
to
it
that
advertisements
for
geoffrey
annersley
were
inserted
in
every
important
paper
from
coast
to
coast
but
nothing
had
come
of
any
of
his
efforts
as
for
the
strange
lapse
of
memory
there
seemed
nothing
to
do
but
wait
in
the
hope
that
recovered
health
and
strength
might
bring
it
back
it
may
come
bit
by
bit
or
by
a
sudden
bound
or
never
was
doctor
holiday
opinion
there
is
nothing
that
i
know
of
that
she
or
you
or
any
one
can
do
except
let
nature
take
her
course
it
is
a
case
of
time
and
patience
i
am
glad
you
brought
her
to
us
margery
and
i
are
very
glad
to
have
her
you
are
awfully
good
uncle
phil
i
do
appreciate
it
and
it
is
great
to
have
you
behind
me
professionally
i
have
got
a
great
deal
of
confidence
in
myself
doctoring
scares
me
sometimes
it
is
such
a
fearful
responsibility
it
is
but
you
are
going
to
be
equal
to
it
the
confidence
will
come
with
experience
you
need
have
no
lack
of
faith
in
yourself
i
have
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
have
when
i
get
letters
like
this
the
senior
doctor
leaned
over
and
extracted
old
doctor
fenton
letter
from
a
cubby
hole
in
his
desk
and
gave
it
to
his
nephew
to
read
the
latter
perused
it
in
silence
with
slightly
heightened
color
praise
always
embarrassed
him
he
is
too
kind
he
observed
as
he
handed
back
the
letter
i
did
do
much
out
there
precious
little
in
fact
but
what
i
was
told
to
do
i
figured
it
out
that
we
young
ones
were
the
privates
and
it
was
up
to
us
to
take
orders
from
the
captains
who
knew
their
business
better
than
we
did
and
get
busy
i
worked
on
that
basis
sound
basis
i
am
not
afraid
that
a
man
who
can
obey
well
wo
be
able
to
command
well
when
the
time
comes
it
is
a
small
thing
to
be
recognized
as
a
true
holiday
either
it
is
something
to
be
proud
of
i
am
proud
uncle
phil
there
is
nothing
i
would
rather
hear
and
deserve
but
if
i
am
anywhere
near
the
holiday
standard
it
is
you
mostly
that
brought
me
up
to
it
i
do
mean
any
dispraise
of
dad
he
was
fine
and
i
am
proud
to
be
his
son
but
he
never
understood
me
i
did
have
enough
dash
and
go
to
me
for
him
ted
and
tony
are
both
more
his
kind
though
i
do
believe
either
of
them
loved
him
as
i
did
but
you
seemed
to
understand
always
you
helped
me
to
believe
in
myself
it
was
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
me
coming
to
you
when
i
did
larry
turned
to
the
mantel
and
picked
up
a
photograph
of
himself
which
stood
there
a
lad
of
fifteen
or
so
facing
the
world
with
grave
sensitive
eyes
the
larry
he
had
been
when
he
came
to
the
house
on
the
hill
he
smiled
at
his
uncle
over
the
boy
picture
you
burned
out
the
plague
spots
too
with
a
mighty
hot
iron
some
of
them
he
added
i
never
forget
your
sitting
there
in
that
very
chair
telling
me
i
was
a
lazy
selfish
snob
and
that
all
things
considered
i
did
measure
up
for
a
nickel
with
dick
jerusalem
i
wonder
if
you
knew
how
that
hit
i
had
a
fairly
good
opinion
of
larry
holiday
in
some
ways
and
you
rather
knocked
the
spots
out
of
it
comparing
me
to
my
disadvantage
with
a
circus
runaway
he
replaced
the
picture
the
smile
still
lingering
on
his
face
it
was
the
right
medicine
though
i
needed
it
i
can
see
that
now
speaking
of
doses
i
wish
you
would
make
ted
tutor
this
summer
i
know
whether
he
has
told
you
i
rather
think
not
but
he
flunked
so
many
courses
he
will
have
to
drop
back
a
year
unless
he
makes
up
the
work
and
takes
examinations
in
the
fall
the
senior
doctor
drummed
thoughtfully
on
the
desk
so
that
was
what
the
boy
had
on
his
mind
why
not
speak
to
him
yourself
he
asked
after
a
minute
and
be
sent
to
warm
regions
as
i
was
last
spring
when
i
ventured
to
give
his
lord
highmightiness
some
advice
no
good
uncle
phil
he
wo
listen
to
me
he
just
gets
mad
and
swings
off
in
the
other
direction
i
handle
him
right
have
your
patience
and
tact
i
wonder
if
he
ever
will
get
any
sense
into
his
head
he
is
the
best
hearted
kid
in
the
world
and
i
crazy
over
him
but
he
does
rile
me
to
the
limit
with
his
varieties
of
foolness
chapter
ix
ted
seizes
the
day
the
next
morning
ted
strolled
into
his
uncle
office
to
ask
if
the
latter
had
any
objections
to
his
accepting
an
invitation
to
a
from
hal
underwood
a
college
classmate
at
the
latter
home
near
springfield
the
doctor
considered
a
moment
before
answering
he
knew
all
about
the
underwoods
and
knew
that
his
erratic
nephew
could
not
be
in
a
safer
pleasanter
place
also
his
quick
wit
saw
a
chance
to
put
the
screws
on
the
lad
in
connection
with
the
tutoring
business
i
suppose
your
june
allowance
is
able
to
float
your
traveling
expenses
he
remarked
less
guilelessly
than
the
remark
sounded
the
june
allowance
was
it
seemed
the
missing
link
i
thought
maybe
you
would
be
willing
to
allow
me
a
little
extra
this
month
on
account
of
commencement
stunts
it
is
darned
expensive
sending
nosegays
to
sweet
girl
graduates
i
could
help
going
broke
honest
i
could
uncle
phil
then
as
his
uncle
did
not
leap
at
the
suggestion
offered
the
speaker
changed
his
tack
anyway
you
would
be
willing
to
let
me
have
my
july
money
ahead
of
time
would
you
he
ingratiated
it
is
only
ten
days
to
the
first
but
doctor
holiday
still
chose
to
be
inconveniently
irrelevant
have
you
any
idea
how
much
my
bill
was
for
repairing
the
car
he
asked
ted
shook
his
head
shamefacedly
and
bent
to
examine
a
picture
in
a
magazine
which
lay
on
the
desk
he
was
anxious
to
have
the
car
incident
resurrected
he
had
thought
it
decently
buried
by
this
time
having
heard
no
more
about
it
it
was
a
little
over
a
hundred
dollars
continued
the
doctor
the
boy
looked
up
genuinely
distressed
gee
uncle
phil
it
highway
robbery
scarcely
all
things
considered
it
was
a
very
fair
bill
a
hundred
dollars
is
a
good
deal
to
pay
for
the
pleasure
of
nearly
getting
yourself
and
somebody
else
killed
ted
ted
pulled
his
forelock
and
had
nothing
to
say
were
you
in
earnest
about
paying
up
for
that
particular
bit
of
folly
son
why
yes
at
least
i
did
think
it
would
be
any
such
sum
as
that
ted
hedged
i
be
swamped
if
i
try
to
pay
it
out
of
my
allowance
i
come
out
even
as
it
is
could
you
take
it
out
of
my
own
money
coming
to
me
when
i
of
age
i
could
if
getting
myself
paid
were
the
chief
consideration
as
it
happens
it
is
i
sorry
if
i
seem
to
be
hard
on
you
but
i
am
going
to
hold
you
to
your
promise
even
if
it
pinches
a
bit
i
think
you
know
why
how
about
it
son
i
suppose
it
has
to
go
that
way
if
you
say
so
said
ted
a
little
sulkily
can
i
pay
it
in
small
amounts
how
small
dollar
a
year
i
hate
to
wait
until
i
was
a
hundred
and
forty
or
so
to
get
my
money
back
the
boy
grinned
reluctantly
answering
the
friendly
twinkle
in
his
uncle
eyes
he
was
relieved
that
a
joke
had
penetrated
what
had
begun
to
appear
to
be
an
unpleasantly
jestless
interview
he
hated
to
be
called
to
account
like
many
another
older
sinner
he
liked
dancing
but
found
paying
the
piper
an
irksome
business
nonsense
uncle
phil
i
meant
real
paying
will
ten
dollars
a
month
do
it
will
provided
you
do
try
to
borrow
ahead
each
month
from
the
next
one
i
wo
glibly
if
you
will
the
boy
broke
off
and
had
the
grace
to
look
confused
realizing
he
had
been
about
to
do
the
very
thing
he
had
promised
in
the
same
breath
not
to
do
then
that
means
i
ca
go
to
hal
he
added
soberly
he
felt
sober
there
was
more
than
hal
and
the
involved
though
the
latter
had
fallen
in
peculiarly
fortuitous
with
his
other
plans
he
had
rashly
written
madeline
he
would
be
in
holyoke
next
week
as
she
desired
and
the
first
of
july
and
his
allowance
would
still
be
just
out
of
reach
next
week
it
was
a
confounded
nuisance
to
say
the
least
being
broke
just
now
with
uncle
phil
turned
stuffy
no
i
do
want
you
to
give
up
your
though
that
rests
with
you
i
make
a
bargain
with
you
i
advance
your
whole
july
allowance
minus
ten
dollars
saturday
morning
ted
face
cleared
beamed
like
sudden
sunshine
on
a
cloudy
march
day
you
will
uncle
phil
you
certainly
are
a
peach
and
in
his
exuberance
he
tossed
his
cap
to
the
ceiling
catching
it
deftly
on
his
nose
as
it
descended
hold
on
do
rejoice
too
soon
it
was
to
be
a
bargain
you
know
you
have
heard
only
one
side
oh
h
the
exclamation
was
slightly
crestfallen
i
understand
that
you
fell
down
on
most
of
your
college
work
this
spring
is
that
correct
this
was
a
new
complication
and
just
as
he
had
thought
he
was
safely
out
of
the
woods
too
ted
hung
his
head
gave
consent
to
his
question
by
silence
and
braced
himself
for
a
lecture
though
he
was
a
little
relieved
that
he
need
not
bring
up
the
subject
of
that
inconvenient
flunking
of
his
himself
that
his
uncle
was
already
prepared
whoever
it
was
that
had
told
tales
the
lecture
did
not
come
however
here
is
the
bargain
i
will
advance
the
money
as
i
said
provided
that
as
soon
as
you
get
back
from
hal
you
will
make
arrangements
to
tutor
with
caldwell
this
summer
in
all
the
subjects
you
failed
in
and
promise
to
put
in
two
months
of
good
solid
cramming
no
half
way
about
it
gee
uncle
phil
it
vacation
you
do
need
a
vacation
if
all
i
hear
of
you
is
true
or
even
half
of
it
you
made
your
whole
college
year
one
grand
sweet
vacation
what
is
the
answer
want
time
to
think
the
proposition
over
no
i
guess
i
take
you
up
i
suppose
i
have
to
tutor
anyway
if
i
do
want
to
drop
back
a
class
and
i
sure
do
ted
admitted
honestly
unless
you
let
me
quit
and
you
wo
it
is
awfully
tough
though
you
never
made
tony
or
larry
kill
themselves
studying
in
vacations
i
do
see
neither
tony
or
larry
ever
flunked
a
college
course
it
remained
for
you
to
be
the
first
holiday
to
wear
a
dunce
cap
ted
flushed
angrily
at
that
the
shot
went
home
as
the
doctor
intended
it
should
he
knew
when
to
hit
and
how
to
do
it
hard
as
larry
had
testified
fool
cap
if
you
like
uncle
phil
i
am
not
a
dunce
i
rather
think
that
is
true
anyway
prove
it
to
us
this
summer
and
there
is
no
one
who
will
be
gladder
than
i
to
take
back
the
aspersion
is
it
understood
then
you
have
your
and
when
you
come
back
you
are
pledged
to
honest
work
no
shirking
no
requests
for
time
off
no
complaints
have
i
your
word
ted
considered
he
thought
he
was
paying
a
stiff
price
for
his
and
his
lark
with
madeline
he
could
give
up
the
first
though
a
fellow
always
had
a
topping
time
at
hal
but
he
could
quite
see
himself
owning
ignominiously
to
madeline
that
he
could
keep
his
promise
to
her
because
of
empty
pockets
moreover
as
he
had
admitted
he
would
have
to
tutor
anyway
probably
and
he
might
as
well
get
some
gain
out
of
the
pain
i
promise
uncle
phil
good
then
that
is
settled
i
am
not
going
to
say
anything
more
about
the
flunking
you
know
how
we
all
feel
about
it
i
think
you
have
sense
enough
and
conscience
enough
to
see
it
about
the
way
the
rest
of
us
do
ted
eyes
were
down
again
now
somehow
uncle
phil
always
made
him
feel
worse
by
what
he
did
say
than
a
million
sermons
from
other
people
would
have
done
he
would
have
gladly
have
given
up
the
projected
journey
and
anything
else
he
possessed
this
moment
if
he
could
have
had
a
clean
slate
to
show
but
it
was
too
late
for
that
now
he
had
to
take
the
consequences
of
his
own
folly
i
see
it
all
right
uncle
phil
he
said
looking
up
trouble
is
i
never
seem
to
have
the
sense
to
look
until
afterward
you
are
awfully
decent
about
it
and
letting
me
go
to
hal
and
everything
i
i
be
gone
about
a
week
do
you
mind
no
stay
as
long
as
you
like
i
am
satisfied
with
your
promise
to
make
good
when
you
do
come
ted
slipped
away
quickly
then
he
was
ashamed
to
meet
his
uncle
kind
eyes
he
knew
he
was
playing
a
crooked
game
with
stacked
cards
he
exactly
lied
had
said
a
word
that
was
strictly
true
indeed
he
was
going
to
hal
but
he
had
let
his
uncle
think
he
was
going
to
stay
there
the
whole
week
whereas
in
reality
he
meant
to
spend
the
greater
part
of
the
time
in
madeline
taylor
society
which
was
not
in
the
bargain
at
all
well
he
would
make
up
later
by
keeping
his
promise
about
the
studying
he
would
show
them
larry
was
the
only
holiday
who
could
make
good
the
dunce
cap
jibe
rankled
and
so
having
satisfied
his
sufficiently
elastic
conscience
he
departed
on
saturday
for
springfield
and
adjacent
points
he
had
the
usual
topping
time
at
hal
and
tore
himself
away
with
the
utmost
reluctance
from
the
had
half
a
mind
indeed
to
wire
madeline
he
could
come
to
holyoke
but
after
all
that
seemed
rather
a
mean
thing
to
do
after
having
treated
her
so
rough
before
and
in
the
end
he
had
gone
only
one
day
later
than
he
had
promised
it
was
characteristic
that
arrived
at
his
destination
he
straightway
forgot
the
pleasures
he
was
foregoing
at
hal
and
plunged
into
amusing
himself
to
the
utmost
with
madeline
taylor
was
ted
holiday
motto
madeline
had
indeed
proved
unexpectedly
pretty
and
attractive
when
she
opened
the
door
to
him
on
cousin
emma
little
box
of
a
front
porch
clad
all
in
white
and
wearing
no
extraneous
ornament
of
any
sort
blushing
delightfully
and
obviously
more
than
glad
of
his
coming
he
would
not
have
been
ted
holiday
if
he
had
risen
to
the
occasion
the
last
girl
in
sight
was
usually
the
only
girl
for
him
so
long
as
she
in
sight
and
sufficiently
jolly
and
good
to
look
upon
a
little
later
madeline
donned
a
trim
tailored
black
sailor
hat
and
a
pretty
and
becoming
pale
green
sweater
and
the
two
went
down
the
steps
together
bound
for
an
excursion
to
the
park
as
they
descended
hand
slipped
gallantly
under
the
girl
elbow
and
she
leaned
on
it
ever
so
little
reveling
in
the
ceremony
and
prolonging
it
as
much
as
possible
well
she
knew
that
cousin
emma
and
the
children
were
peering
out
from
behind
the
curtains
of
the
front
bedroom
upstairs
and
that
bascom
and
her
stuck
up
daughter
lily
had
their
faces
glued
to
the
pane
next
door
they
would
all
see
that
this
was
no
ordinary
beau
but
a
real
swell
like
the
magnificent
young
men
in
the
movies
perhaps
as
she
descended
cousin
emma
steps
and
went
down
the
path
between
the
tiger
lilies
and
peonies
that
flanked
the
graveled
path
with
ted
holiday
beside
her
madeline
taylor
had
her
one
perfect
moment
only
the
ordinary
fred
on
hearing
his
wife
voluble
descriptions
later
of
madeline
grand
young
man
failed
to
be
suitably
impressed
them
swells
do
mean
no
girl
no
good
no
time
he
had
summed
up
his
views
with
sententious
accumulation
of
negatives
but
little
enough
did
either
ted
or
madeline
reck
of
fred
or
any
other
opinion
as
they
fared
their
blithe
and
way
that
gala
week
the
rest
of
the
world
was
supremely
unimportant
as
they
went
canoeing
and
motoring
and
trolley
riding
and
mountain
climbing
and
movieing
together
madeline
strove
with
all
her
might
to
dress
and
act
and
as
nearly
like
those
other
girls
after
whom
she
was
modeling
herself
as
possible
to
do
nothing
which
could
jar
on
ted
in
any
way
or
remind
him
that
she
was
different
in
her
happiness
and
sincere
desire
to
please
she
succeeded
remarkably
well
in
making
herself
superficially
at
least
very
much
like
ted
own
kind
of
girl
and
though
with
true
masculine
obtuseness
he
was
entirely
unaware
of
the
conscious
effort
she
was
putting
into
the
performance
nevertheless
he
enjoyed
the
results
in
full
and
played
up
to
her
undeniable
charms
with
his
usual
debonair
and
heedless
grace
and
gallantry
the
one
thing
that
had
been
left
out
of
the
program
for
lack
of
suitable
opportunity
was
dancing
an
omission
not
to
be
tolerated
by
two
strenuous
and
modern
young
persons
who
would
rather
fox
trot
than
eat
any
day
accordingly
on
thursday
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
repair
to
the
white
swan
a
resort
down
the
river
famous
for
its
excellent
cuisine
its
perfect
dance
floor
and
its
snappy
negro
orchestra
both
ted
and
madeline
knew
that
the
swan
had
also
a
reputation
of
another
less
desirable
sort
but
both
were
willing
to
ignore
the
fact
for
the
sake
of
enjoying
the
jolliest
jazz
on
the
river
as
the
advertisement
read
the
dance
was
the
thing
it
was
indeed
the
evening
was
decidedly
the
best
yet
as
both
averred
pirouetting
and
spinning
and
romping
through
one
fox
trot
and
one
step
after
another
the
excitement
of
the
music
the
general
air
of
exhilaration
about
the
place
and
their
own
mood
made
the
occasion
different
from
the
other
gaieties
of
the
week
merrier
madder
a
little
more
reckless
once
seeing
a
painted
or
rather
girl
in
the
arms
of
a
roué
both
obviously
under
the
spell
of
too
much
liquid
inspiration
ted
suffered
a
momentary
revulsion
and
qualm
of
conscience
he
should
have
brought
madeline
here
it
was
the
sort
of
place
to
bring
a
girl
no
matter
how
good
the
music
was
oh
well
what
did
it
matter
just
this
once
they
were
there
now
and
they
might
as
well
get
all
the
fun
they
could
out
of
it
the
music
started
up
he
held
out
his
hand
to
madeline
and
they
wheeled
into
the
maze
of
dancers
the
girl
pliant
body
yielding
to
his
arms
her
eyes
brilliant
with
excitement
they
danced
on
and
on
and
it
was
amazingly
and
imprudently
late
when
they
finally
left
the
swan
and
went
home
to
cousin
emma
house
ted
had
meant
to
leave
madeline
at
the
gate
but
somehow
he
lingered
and
followed
the
girl
out
into
the
yard
behind
the
house
where
they
seated
themselves
in
the
hammock
in
the
shade
of
the
lilac
bushes
and
suddenly
without
any
warning
he
had
her
in
his
arms
and
was
kissing
her
tempestuously
it
was
only
for
a
moment
however
he
pulled
himself
together
hot
cheeked
and
ashamed
and
flung
himself
out
of
the
hammock
madeline
sat
very
still
not
saying
a
word
as
she
watched
him
march
to
and
fro
between
the
beds
of
verbena
and
and
portulaca
presently
he
paused
beside
the
hammock
looking
down
at
the
girl
i
am
going
home
he
said
a
little
huskily
madeline
threw
out
one
hand
and
clutched
one
of
the
boy
in
a
feverish
clasp
no
no
she
cried
you
must
go
please
do
ted
i
got
to
stolidly
why
you
know
why
you
mean
what
you
did
just
now
he
nodded
miserably
that
does
matter
i
not
angry
i
i
liked
it
i
am
afraid
it
does
matter
it
makes
a
mess
of
everything
and
it
all
my
fault
i
spoiled
things
i
got
to
go
but
you
will
come
back
she
pleaded
he
shook
his
head
it
is
better
not
madeline
i
sorry
she
snatched
her
hand
away
from
his
her
eyes
shooting
sparks
of
anger
i
hate
you
ted
holiday
you
make
me
care
and
then
you
go
away
and
leave
me
you
are
cruel
selfish
i
hate
you
hate
you
ted
stared
down
at
her
helpless
miserable
ashamed
no
man
knows
what
to
do
with
a
scene
especially
one
which
his
own
folly
has
precipitated
willis
hubbard
is
coming
down
night
and
if
you
do
stay
as
you
promised
i
go
to
the
swan
with
him
he
has
been
teasing
me
to
go
for
ages
and
i
would
but
i
will
now
if
you
leave
me
i
i
do
anything
ted
was
worried
he
did
not
like
the
sound
of
the
girl
threats
though
he
was
moved
from
his
own
purpose
do
go
to
the
swan
with
hubbard
madeline
you
must
why
not
you
took
me
i
know
i
did
but
that
is
different
he
finished
lamely
i
do
see
anything
very
different
she
retorted
hotly
ted
bit
his
lip
remembering
his
own
recent
aberration
he
did
not
see
as
much
difference
as
he
would
have
liked
to
see
himself
i
suppose
you
would
have
taken
kind
of
girl
to
the
swan
taunted
madeline
no
i
it
was
a
fatal
admission
ted
had
meant
to
make
it
so
bluntly
but
it
was
out
the
damage
was
done
a
demon
of
rage
possessed
the
girl
beside
herself
with
anger
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
delivered
a
stinging
blow
straight
in
the
boy
face
then
her
mood
changing
she
fell
back
into
the
hammock
sobbing
bitterly
for
a
moment
ted
was
too
much
astonished
by
this
exhibition
of
temper
even
to
be
angry
with
himself
then
a
hot
wave
of
wrath
and
shame
surged
over
him
he
put
up
his
hand
to
his
cheek
as
if
to
brush
away
the
indignity
of
the
blow
but
he
was
honest
enough
to
realize
that
maybe
he
had
deserved
the
punishment
though
not
for
the
reason
the
girl
had
dealt
it
looking
down
at
her
in
her
racked
misery
his
resentment
vanished
and
an
odd
impersonal
kind
of
pity
for
her
possessed
him
instead
though
her
attraction
was
gone
forever
he
could
see
the
scar
on
her
forehead
and
it
troubled
and
reproached
him
vaguely
seemed
a
symbol
of
a
deeper
wound
he
had
dealt
her
though
never
meaning
any
harm
he
bent
over
her
gently
forgive
me
madeline
he
said
i
am
sorry
sorry
for
everything
goodby
in
a
moment
he
was
gone
past
the
portulaca
and
past
cousin
emma
unlit
parlor
windows
down
the
walk
between
the
tiger
lilies
and
peonies
out
into
the
street
and
madeline
suddenly
realizing
that
she
was
alone
rushed
after
him
calling
his
name
softly
into
the
dark
but
only
the
echo
of
his
firm
buoyant
young
feet
came
back
to
her
straining
ears
she
fled
back
to
the
garden
and
throwing
herself
face
down
on
the
dew
drenched
grass
surrendered
to
a
passion
of
tearless
grief
ted
astonished
his
uncle
first
by
coming
home
a
whole
day
earlier
than
he
had
been
expected
and
second
by
announcing
his
intention
of
seeing
robert
caldwell
and
making
arrangements
about
the
tutoring
that
very
day
he
was
more
than
usually
uncommunicative
about
his
experiences
the
doctor
thought
and
fancied
too
that
just
at
first
after
his
return
the
boy
did
not
meet
his
eyes
quite
frankly
but
this
soon
passed
away
and
he
was
delighted
and
it
must
be
confessed
considerably
astounded
too
to
perceive
that
ted
really
meant
to
keep
his
word
about
the
studying
and
settled
down
to
genuine
hard
work
for
perhaps
the
first
time
in
his
idle
irresponsible
young
life
he
had
been
prepared
to
put
on
the
screws
if
necessary
there
had
been
no
need
ted
had
applied
his
own
screws
and
kept
at
his
uncongenial
task
with
such
grim
determination
that
it
almost
alarmed
his
family
so
contrary
was
his
conduct
to
his
usual
shedding
of
all
obligations
which
he
could
by
hook
or
crook
evade
among
other
things
to
be
noted
with
relief
the
doctor
counted
the
fact
that
there
were
no
more
letters
from
florence
apparently
that
flame
which
had
blazed
up
rather
brightly
at
first
had
died
down
as
a
good
many
others
had
doctor
holiday
was
particularly
glad
in
this
case
he
had
not
liked
the
idea
of
his
nephew
running
around
with
a
girl
who
would
be
willing
to
go
with
him
after
midnight
and
still
less
had
he
liked
the
idea
of
his
nephew
issuing
such
invitations
to
any
kind
of
girl
youth
was
youth
and
he
had
never
kept
a
very
tight
rein
on
any
of
ned
children
believing
he
could
trust
them
to
run
straight
in
the
main
still
there
were
things
one
drew
the
line
at
for
a
holiday
chapter
x
tony
dances
into
a
discovery
tony
was
dressing
for
dinner
on
her
first
evening
at
crest
house
carlotta
was
perched
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
near
by
catching
up
on
mutual
gossip
as
to
events
that
had
transpired
since
they
parted
a
month
before
at
northampton
i
have
a
brand
new
young
man
for
you
tony
alan
massey
the
artist
at
least
he
calls
himself
an
artist
though
he
has
done
a
thing
but
philander
and
travel
two
or
three
times
around
the
globe
so
near
as
i
can
make
out
since
somebody
died
and
left
him
a
disgusting
big
fortune
aunt
lottie
hints
that
he
is
very
improper
but
anyway
he
is
amusing
and
different
and
a
dream
of
a
dancer
it
is
funny
but
he
makes
me
think
a
little
bit
once
in
a
while
of
somebody
we
both
know
i
wo
tell
you
who
and
see
if
the
same
thing
strikes
you
a
little
later
tony
met
the
new
young
man
she
was
standing
with
her
friend
in
the
big
living
room
waiting
for
the
signal
for
dinner
when
she
felt
suddenly
conscious
of
a
new
presence
she
turned
quickly
and
saw
a
stranger
standing
on
the
threshold
regarding
her
with
a
rather
disconcertingly
intent
gaze
he
was
very
tall
and
different
as
carlotta
had
said
with
thick
waving
hair
a
clear
olive
skin
and
eyes
there
was
nothing
about
him
that
suggested
any
resemblance
to
anyone
she
knew
indeed
she
had
a
feeling
that
there
was
nobody
at
all
like
him
anywhere
in
the
world
the
newcomer
walked
toward
her
their
glances
crossing
tony
stood
very
still
but
she
had
an
unaccountable
sensation
of
going
to
meet
him
as
if
he
had
drawn
her
to
him
by
his
strange
sweeping
look
they
were
introduced
he
bowed
low
in
courtly
old
world
fashion
over
the
girl
hand
i
am
enchanted
to
know
miss
holiday
he
said
his
voice
was
as
unusual
as
the
rest
of
him
musical
vibrant
an
unforgettable
voice
it
seemed
to
tony
who
for
a
moment
seemed
to
have
lost
her
own
i
shall
sit
beside
miss
tony
carla
he
added
it
was
not
a
question
not
a
plea
it
was
clear
assertion
not
alan
you
are
between
aunt
lottie
and
mary
frances
day
you
liked
mary
frances
yesterday
you
flirted
with
her
outrageously
last
night
he
shrugged
ah
but
that
was
last
night
my
dear
and
this
is
and
i
have
seen
your
miss
tony
that
alters
everything
even
your
seating
arrangements
change
me
carlotta
carlotta
laughed
and
capitulated
alan
highhanded
tactics
always
amused
her
not
that
you
deserve
it
she
said
do
be
too
nice
to
him
tony
he
is
not
a
nice
person
at
all
so
it
happened
that
tony
found
herself
at
dinner
between
ted
friend
and
her
own
hal
underwood
and
this
strange
impossible
arbitrary
new
personage
who
had
hypnotized
her
into
unwonted
silence
at
their
first
meeting
she
had
recovered
her
usual
poise
by
this
time
however
and
was
quite
prepared
to
keep
alan
massey
in
due
subjection
if
necessary
she
did
not
like
masterful
men
they
always
roused
her
own
none
too
dormant
willfulness
as
they
sat
down
he
bent
over
to
her
you
are
glad
i
made
carlotta
put
us
together
he
said
and
this
too
was
no
question
but
an
assertion
tony
was
in
arms
in
a
flash
on
the
contrary
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
she
gave
in
to
you
you
seem
to
be
altogether
too
accustomed
to
having
your
own
way
as
it
is
and
rather
pointedly
she
turned
her
pretty
shoulder
on
her
too
presuming
neighbor
and
proceeded
to
devote
her
undivided
attention
for
two
entire
courses
to
hal
underwood
but
with
the
fish
hal
partner
on
the
other
side
a
slim
young
person
in
a
glittering
green
sequined
gown
suggesting
a
fish
herself
or
at
politest
a
mermaid
challenged
his
notice
and
tony
returned
perforce
to
her
companion
who
had
not
spoken
a
single
word
since
she
had
snubbed
him
as
tony
was
well
aware
though
she
had
seemed
so
entirely
absorbed
in
her
own
conversation
with
hal
his
eyes
smiled
imperturbably
into
hers
am
i
pardoned
surely
i
have
been
punished
enough
for
my
sins
whatever
they
may
have
been
i
hope
so
said
tony
are
you
always
so
disagreeable
i
am
never
disagreeable
when
i
am
having
my
own
way
i
am
always
good
when
i
am
happy
at
this
moment
i
am
very
very
good
it
hardly
seems
possible
said
tony
carlotta
said
you
were
not
good
at
all
he
shrugged
a
favorite
mannerism
it
seemed
goodness
is
relative
and
a
very
dull
topic
in
any
case
let
us
talk
instead
of
the
most
interesting
subject
in
the
universe
love
you
know
of
course
i
am
madly
in
love
with
you
indeed
no
i
did
suspect
it
parried
tony
you
fall
in
love
easily
scarcely
easily
in
this
case
i
should
say
rather
upon
tremendous
provocation
i
suppose
you
know
how
beautiful
you
are
i
look
in
the
mirror
occasionally
admitted
tony
with
a
glimmer
of
mischief
in
her
eyes
carlotta
told
me
you
were
a
philanderer
forewarned
is
forearmed
mr
massey
ah
but
this
is
philandery
it
is
truth
suddenly
the
mockery
had
died
out
of
his
voice
and
his
eyes
i
have
waited
a
very
long
time
for
you
too
long
life
has
been
an
arid
waste
without
you
but
allah
be
praised
you
are
here
at
last
you
are
going
to
love
me
ah
my
tony
how
you
are
going
to
love
me
the
last
words
were
spoken
very
low
for
the
girl
ears
alone
though
more
than
one
person
at
the
table
seeing
him
bend
over
her
understood
that
alan
massey
that
professional
was
off
again
do
massey
i
do
care
for
that
kind
of
jest
jest
good
god
tony
holiday
do
you
know
that
i
mean
it
that
this
is
the
real
thing
at
last
for
me
and
for
you
do
fight
it
mademoiselle
beautiful
it
will
do
no
good
i
love
you
and
you
are
going
to
love
me
divinely
i
do
even
like
you
denied
tony
hotly
what
of
that
what
do
i
care
for
your
liking
that
is
for
others
but
your
loving
that
shall
be
mine
all
mine
you
will
see
i
am
afraid
you
are
very
much
mistaken
if
you
do
mean
all
you
are
saying
please
talk
to
miss
irvine
now
you
have
said
a
word
to
her
since
you
sat
down
i
hate
rudeness
again
tony
turned
a
cold
shoulder
upon
her
amazing
dinner
companion
but
she
did
not
do
it
so
easily
or
so
calmly
this
time
she
was
not
unused
to
the
strange
ways
of
men
not
for
nothing
had
she
spent
so
much
of
her
life
at
army
posts
where
is
as
familiar
as
brass
buttons
sudden
gusts
of
passion
were
no
novelty
to
her
nor
was
it
a
new
thing
to
hear
that
a
man
thought
he
loved
her
but
alan
massey
was
different
she
disliked
him
intensely
she
resented
the
arrogance
of
his
assumptions
with
all
her
might
but
he
interested
her
amazingly
and
incredible
as
it
might
seem
and
not
to
be
admitted
out
loud
he
was
speaking
the
truth
just
now
he
did
love
her
in
her
heart
tony
knew
that
she
had
felt
his
love
before
he
had
ever
spoken
a
word
to
her
when
their
eyes
had
met
as
he
stood
on
the
threshold
and
she
knew
too
instinctively
that
his
love
if
it
was
that
was
not
a
thing
to
be
treated
like
the
little
summer
day
loves
of
the
others
it
was
big
rather
fearful
not
to
be
flouted
or
played
with
one
did
not
play
with
a
meteor
when
it
crossed
one
path
one
fled
from
it
or
stayed
and
let
it
destroy
one
if
it
would
she
roused
herself
to
think
of
other
people
to
forget
alan
massey
and
his
wonderful
voice
which
had
said
such
perturbing
things
over
across
the
table
carlotta
was
talking
vivaciously
to
a
youth
who
scarcely
opened
his
mouth
except
to
consume
food
but
whose
eyes
drank
in
every
movement
of
carlotta
one
saw
at
a
glance
he
was
another
of
that
spoiled
little
coquette
many
victims
tony
asked
hal
who
he
was
he
seemed
scarcely
worth
so
many
of
carlotta
sparkles
she
thought
herb
lathrop
father
is
the
big
tea
and
coffee
man
all
rolled
up
in
millions
carlotta
people
are
putting
all
the
bets
on
him
apparently
though
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
see
why
do
see
why
people
with
money
are
always
expected
to
match
up
with
somebody
with
a
whole
caboodle
of
the
same
junk
ought
to
be
evened
up
i
think
and
a
bit
of
eugenics
slipped
in
instead
of
so
much
cash
for
good
measure
you
can
see
what
a
poor
fish
he
is
in
my
opinion
she
had
much
better
marry
your
neighbor
up
there
on
the
hill
he
is
worth
a
gross
of
herb
lathrops
and
she
knows
it
carlotta
is
no
fool
you
mean
phil
lambert
tony
was
surprised
hal
nodded
that
the
chap
only
man
i
ever
knew
that
could
keep
carlotta
in
order
but
carlotta
has
the
slightest
idea
of
marrying
phil
objected
tony
maybe
not
i
only
say
he
is
the
man
she
ought
to
marry
i
say
tony
does
she
seem
happy
to
you
carlotta
why
yes
i
had
thought
she
seems
gayer
than
usual
if
anything
tony
eyes
sought
her
friend
face
was
there
something
a
little
forced
about
that
gaiety
of
hers
for
the
first
time
it
struck
her
that
there
was
a
restlessness
in
the
lovely
violet
eyes
which
was
unfamiliar
was
carlotta
unhappy
evidently
hal
thought
so
you
have
sharp
eyes
hal
she
commented
i
had
noticed
oh
i
one
of
the
singed
moths
you
know
i
know
carlotta
pretty
well
and
i
know
she
is
fighting
some
kind
of
a
fight
maybe
with
herself
i
rather
think
it
is
tell
phil
lambert
to
come
down
here
and
marry
her
out
of
hand
i
tell
you
lambert
the
man
you
think
carlotta
loves
phil
i
do
think
is
my
business
prying
into
a
girl
fancies
simply
telling
you
phil
lambert
is
the
man
that
ought
to
marry
her
and
if
he
does
get
on
to
the
job
almighty
quick
that
simpleton
over
there
will
be
prancing
down
the
aisle
to
lohengrin
with
carlotta
before
christmas
and
the
jig
will
be
up
you
tell
him
what
i
say
and
study
the
thing
a
bit
yourself
while
you
are
here
tony
see
if
you
can
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
i
hate
to
have
her
mess
things
up
for
herself
that
way
whereupon
hal
once
more
proceeded
to
do
his
duty
to
the
mermaid
leaving
tony
to
her
other
partner
well
the
latter
murmured
seeing
her
free
i
have
done
the
heavy
polite
act
discussed
polo
and
and
finished
all
three
subjects
neatly
do
i
get
my
reward
what
do
you
ask
the
first
dance
and
then
the
garden
and
the
moon
and
you
all
to
myself
tony
shook
her
head
she
was
on
guard
i
shall
want
more
than
one
dance
and
more
than
one
partner
i
am
afraid
i
sha
have
time
for
the
moon
and
the
garden
i
adore
dancing
i
never
stop
until
the
music
does
a
flash
of
exultancy
leaped
into
his
eyes
so
i
might
have
known
you
would
adore
dancing
you
shall
have
your
fill
you
shall
have
many
dances
but
only
one
partner
i
shall
suffice
i
am
one
of
the
best
dancers
in
the
world
and
evidently
one
of
the
vainest
men
coolly
what
of
it
vanity
is
good
when
it
is
not
misplaced
but
i
was
not
boasting
i
one
of
the
best
dancers
in
the
world
why
should
i
not
be
my
mother
was
lucia
vannini
she
danced
before
princes
he
might
have
added
she
was
a
prince
mistress
it
had
been
the
truth
oh
cried
tony
she
had
heard
of
lucia
vannini
a
famous
italian
beauty
and
dancer
of
three
decades
ago
so
alan
massey
was
her
son
no
wonder
he
was
foreign
different
in
ways
and
looks
one
could
forgive
his
extravagances
when
one
knew
ah
you
like
that
my
beauty
you
will
like
it
even
better
when
you
have
danced
with
me
it
is
then
that
you
will
know
what
it
is
to
dance
we
shall
dance
and
dance
and
love
i
shall
make
you
mine
dancing
tony
shrank
back
from
his
ardent
eyes
and
his
veiled
threat
she
was
a
passionate
devotee
of
her
own
freedom
she
did
not
want
to
be
made
his
or
any
man
certainly
not
his
she
decided
not
to
dance
with
him
at
all
but
later
when
the
violins
began
to
play
and
alan
massey
came
and
stood
before
her
uttering
no
word
but
commanding
her
to
him
with
his
eyes
and
his
nervous
slender
strong
artist
hands
she
yielded
could
scarcely
have
refused
if
she
had
wanted
to
but
she
did
not
want
to
though
she
told
herself
it
was
with
lucia
vannini
son
rather
than
with
alan
massey
that
she
desired
to
dance
after
that
she
thought
not
at
all
gave
herself
up
to
the
very
ecstasy
of
emotion
she
had
danced
all
her
life
but
even
as
he
had
predicted
she
learned
for
the
first
time
in
this
man
arms
what
dancing
really
was
it
was
like
nothing
she
had
ever
even
dreamed
of
pure
poetry
of
motion
a
curious
rather
alarming
weaving
into
one
of
two
vividly
alive
persons
in
a
kind
of
pagan
harmony
a
rhythmic
rapture
so
intense
it
almost
hurt
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
have
gone
on
thus
forever
but
suddenly
she
perceived
that
she
and
her
partner
had
the
floor
alone
the
others
had
stopped
to
watch
though
the
musicians
still
played
on
frenziedly
faster
and
faster
flushed
embarrassed
at
finding
herself
thus
conspicuous
she
drew
herself
away
from
alan
massey
we
must
stop
she
murmured
they
are
all
looking
at
us
what
of
it
he
bent
over
her
his
passionate
eyes
a
caress
did
i
not
tell
you
was
it
not
very
heaven
tony
shook
her
head
i
am
afraid
there
was
nothing
heavenly
about
it
but
it
was
wonderful
i
forgive
you
your
boasting
you
are
the
best
dancer
in
the
world
i
am
sure
of
it
and
you
will
dance
with
me
again
and
again
my
you
must
you
want
to
i
want
to
admitted
tony
but
i
am
not
going
to
at
least
not
again
take
me
to
a
seat
he
did
so
and
she
sank
down
with
a
fluttering
sigh
beside
miss
lottie
cressy
carlotta
aunt
the
latter
stared
at
her
a
little
oddly
she
thought
and
then
looked
up
at
alan
massey
you
do
change
do
you
alan
observed
miss
cressy
oh
yes
i
change
a
great
deal
i
have
been
very
different
ever
since
i
met
miss
tony
his
eyes
fell
on
the
girl
made
no
secret
of
his
emotions
concerning
her
and
her
beauty
miss
cressy
laughed
a
little
sardonically
no
doubt
you
were
always
different
after
each
new
sweetheart
i
recall
so
were
they
some
of
them
you
do
me
too
much
honor
he
retorted
suavely
shall
we
not
go
out
miss
holiday
the
garden
is
very
beautiful
by
moonlight
she
bowed
assent
and
together
they
passed
out
of
the
room
through
the
french
window
miss
cressy
stared
after
them
the
bitter
little
smile
still
lingering
on
her
lips
youth
for
alan
always
she
said
to
herself
ah
well
i
was
young
too
those
days
in
paris
i
must
tell
carlotta
to
warn
tony
it
would
be
a
pity
for
the
child
to
be
tarnished
so
soon
by
touching
his
kind
too
close
she
is
so
young
and
so
lovely
alan
and
tony
strayed
to
a
remote
corner
of
the
spacious
gardens
and
came
to
a
pause
beside
the
fountain
which
leaped
and
splashed
and
caught
the
moonlight
in
its
falling
splendor
for
a
moment
neither
spoke
tony
bent
to
dip
her
fingers
in
the
cool
water
she
had
an
odd
feeling
of
needing
lustration
from
something
the
man
eyes
were
upon
her
she
was
very
young
very
lovely
as
miss
cressy
had
said
there
was
something
strangely
moving
to
alan
massey
about
her
virginal
freshness
her
moonshine
beauty
he
was
unaccustomed
to
compunction
but
for
a
fleeting
second
as
he
studied
tony
holiday
standing
there
with
bowed
head
laving
her
hands
in
the
sparkling
purity
of
the
water
he
had
an
impulse
to
go
away
and
leave
her
lest
he
cast
a
shadow
upon
her
by
his
lingering
near
her
it
was
only
for
a
moment
he
was
far
too
selfish
to
follow
the
brief
urge
to
renunciation
the
girl
stirred
his
passion
too
deeply
roused
his
will
to
conquer
too
irresistibly
to
permit
him
to
forego
the
privilege
of
the
place
and
hour
she
looked
up
at
him
and
he
smiled
down
at
her
once
more
the
i
was
right
was
i
not
i
did
make
you
a
little
bit
mine
did
i
not
be
honest
tell
me
he
laid
a
hand
on
each
of
her
bare
white
shoulders
looked
deep
deep
into
her
brown
eyes
as
if
he
would
read
secret
things
in
their
depths
tony
drew
away
from
his
hands
dropped
her
gaze
once
more
to
the
rippling
white
of
the
water
which
was
less
disconcerting
than
alan
massey
too
ardent
green
eyes
you
danced
with
me
divinely
i
shall
also
make
you
love
me
divinely
even
as
i
promised
you
know
it
dear
one
you
can
not
deny
it
the
magically
beautiful
voice
which
pulled
so
oddly
at
her
heart
strings
went
on
softly
almost
in
a
sort
of
chant
you
love
me
already
my
white
moonshine
girl
he
whispered
tell
me
you
do
ah
but
i
do
denied
tony
i
i
wo
i
do
want
to
love
anybody
you
can
not
help
it
dear
heart
nature
made
you
for
loving
and
being
loved
and
it
is
i
that
you
are
going
to
love
mine
that
you
shall
be
tell
me
did
you
ever
feel
before
as
you
felt
in
there
when
we
were
dancing
no
said
tony
her
eyes
still
downcast
i
knew
it
you
are
mine
belovedest
i
knew
it
the
moment
i
saw
you
it
is
kismet
kiss
me
no
the
girl
pulled
herself
away
from
him
her
face
aflame
no
then
so
he
drew
her
back
to
him
and
lifted
her
face
gently
with
his
two
hands
he
bent
over
her
his
lips
close
to
hers
if
you
kiss
me
i
never
dance
with
you
again
as
long
as
i
live
she
flashed
he
laughed
a
little
mockingly
but
he
lowered
his
hands
made
no
effort
to
gainsay
her
will
what
a
horrible
threat
you
cruel
little
moonbeam
but
you
would
keep
it
you
could
you
love
to
dance
with
me
too
well
i
would
she
protested
the
more
sharply
because
she
suspected
he
was
right
that
she
would
dance
with
him
again
no
matter
what
he
did
any
way
i
shall
not
dance
with
you
again
and
i
shall
not
stay
out
here
with
you
any
longer
she
turned
to
flee
but
he
put
out
his
hand
and
held
her
back
not
so
fast
my
tony
they
have
eyes
and
ears
in
there
if
you
run
away
from
me
and
go
back
with
those
glorious
fires
lit
in
your
cheeks
and
in
your
eyes
they
will
believe
i
did
kiss
oh
gasped
tony
indignant
but
lingering
recognizing
the
probable
truth
of
his
prediction
we
shall
go
together
after
a
minute
with
sedateness
as
if
we
had
been
studying
the
stars
i
am
wise
my
tony
trust
me
very
well
assented
tony
how
many
stars
are
there
in
the
pleiades
anyway
she
asked
with
sudden
imps
of
mirth
in
her
eyes
again
she
felt
on
safe
ground
sure
that
she
had
conquered
and
put
a
too
presuming
male
in
his
place
she
had
no
idea
that
the
laurels
had
been
chiefly
not
hers
at
all
but
alan
massey
who
was
quite
as
wise
as
he
boasted
but
she
kept
her
word
and
danced
no
more
with
alan
massey
that
night
she
did
not
dare
she
hated
alan
massey
disapproved
of
him
heartily
and
knew
it
would
be
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
fall
in
love
with
him
especially
if
she
let
herself
dance
often
with
him
as
they
had
danced
and
so
her
very
first
night
at
crest
house
antoinette
holiday
discovered
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
love
after
all
and
that
it
had
to
be
reckoned
with
whether
you
desired
or
not
to
welcome
it
at
your
door
chapter
xi
things
that
were
not
all
on
the
card
after
that
first
night
in
the
garden
alan
massey
did
not
try
to
make
open
love
to
tony
again
but
his
eyes
following
her
wherever
she
moved
made
no
secret
of
his
adoration
he
was
nearly
always
by
her
side
driving
off
other
devotees
when
he
chose
with
a
cool
which
sometimes
amused
sometimes
infuriated
tony
she
found
the
man
a
baffling
and
fascinating
combination
of
qualities
all
petty
selfishness
and
colossal
egotisms
one
minute
abounding
in
endless
charms
and
graces
and
small
endearing
chivalries
the
next
outrageously
outspoken
at
times
at
other
times
reticent
to
the
point
of
secretiveness
now
reaching
the
most
extravagant
pitch
of
high
spirits
and
then
almost
without
warning
submerged
in
moods
of
stygian
gloom
from
which
nothing
could
rouse
him
tony
came
to
know
something
of
his
romantic
and
rather
mottled
career
from
carlotta
and
others
even
from
alan
himself
she
knew
perfectly
well
he
was
not
the
kind
of
man
larry
or
her
uncle
would
approve
or
tolerate
she
disapproved
of
him
rather
heartily
herself
in
many
ways
at
times
she
disliked
him
passionately
made
up
her
mind
she
would
have
no
more
to
do
with
him
at
other
times
she
was
all
but
in
love
with
him
and
suspected
she
would
have
found
the
world
an
intolerably
dull
place
with
alan
massey
suddenly
removed
from
it
when
they
danced
together
she
was
dangerously
near
being
what
he
had
claimed
she
was
or
would
be
all
his
she
knew
this
was
afraid
of
it
yet
she
kept
on
dancing
with
him
night
after
night
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
to
as
if
she
would
have
danced
with
him
even
if
she
knew
the
next
moment
would
send
them
both
hurtling
through
space
like
lucifer
down
to
damnation
it
was
not
until
dick
carson
came
down
for
a
week
end
some
time
later
that
tony
discovered
the
resemblance
in
alan
to
some
one
she
knew
of
which
carlotta
had
spoken
incredibly
and
inexplicably
dick
and
alan
possessed
a
shadowy
sort
of
similarity
in
most
respects
they
were
as
different
in
appearance
as
they
were
in
personality
dick
hair
was
brown
and
straight
alan
black
and
wavy
dick
eyes
were
steady
alan
shifty
yet
the
resemblance
was
there
elusive
though
it
was
perhaps
it
lay
in
the
curve
of
the
sensitive
nostrils
perhaps
in
the
firm
contour
of
chin
perhaps
in
the
arch
of
the
brow
perhaps
it
was
nothing
so
tangible
just
a
fleeting
trick
of
expression
tony
did
not
know
but
she
caught
the
thing
just
as
carlotta
had
and
it
puzzled
and
interested
her
she
spoke
of
it
to
alan
the
next
morning
after
dick
arrival
as
they
idled
together
stretched
out
on
the
sand
waiting
for
the
others
to
come
out
of
the
surf
to
her
surprise
he
was
instantly
highly
annoyed
and
resentful
for
heaven
sake
tony
do
get
the
resemblance
mania
it
a
disgusting
habit
i
knew
a
woman
once
who
was
always
chasing
likenesses
in
people
and
prattling
about
them
got
her
in
trouble
once
and
served
her
right
she
told
a
young
lieutenant
that
he
looked
extraordinarily
like
a
certain
famous
general
of
her
acquaintance
it
proved
later
that
the
young
man
had
been
born
at
the
post
where
the
general
was
stationed
while
the
presumptive
father
was
absent
on
a
year
cruise
it
had
been
quite
a
prominent
scandal
at
the
time
that
is
a
nice
story
alan
moreover
it
is
entirely
irrelevant
but
you
and
dick
do
look
alike
i
am
not
the
only
or
the
first
person
who
saw
it
either
alan
started
and
frowned
good
lord
who
else
he
demanded
carlotta
the
devil
she
did
alan
eyes
were
vindictive
then
he
laughed
commend
me
to
a
girl
imagination
this
dick
chap
seems
to
be
head
over
heels
in
love
with
you
he
added
what
nonsense
denied
tony
crisply
fashioning
a
miniature
sand
mountain
as
she
spoke
no
nonsense
at
all
my
dear
perfectly
obvious
fact
do
you
suppose
i
know
how
a
man
looks
when
he
is
in
love
i
ought
to
i
been
in
love
often
enough
tony
demolished
her
mountain
with
a
wrathful
sweep
of
her
hand
and
registered
all
the
appropriate
emotions
before
the
mirror
i
suppose
you
make
me
sick
alan
you
are
all
pose
i
do
believe
there
is
a
single
sincere
thing
about
you
oh
yes
there
is
are
two
what
are
they
one
is
my
sincere
devotion
to
yourself
my
beautiful
the
other
an
equally
sincere
devotion
to
i
grant
you
the
second
at
least
do
pose
yourself
my
darling
you
know
i
love
you
you
pretend
you
do
believe
it
but
you
do
and
way
down
deep
in
your
heart
you
love
my
love
it
makes
your
heart
beat
fast
just
to
think
of
it
see
did
i
not
tell
you
he
had
suddenly
put
out
his
hand
and
laid
it
over
her
heart
poor
little
wild
bird
how
its
wings
flutter
tony
got
up
swiftly
from
the
sand
her
face
scarlet
she
was
indignant
betrayed
for
her
heart
had
been
beating
at
a
fearful
clip
and
she
knew
it
how
dare
you
touch
me
like
that
alan
massey
i
detest
you
i
do
see
why
i
ever
listen
to
you
at
all
or
let
you
come
near
me
alan
massey
still
lounging
at
her
feet
looked
up
at
her
as
she
stood
above
him
slim
supple
softly
rounded
adorably
pretty
and
feminine
in
her
black
satin
bathing
suit
and
vivid
emerald
hued
cap
i
know
why
he
said
and
rose
too
slowly
with
the
indolent
grace
of
a
leopard
so
do
you
my
tony
he
added
we
both
know
will
you
dance
with
me
a
great
deal
no
how
many
times
not
at
all
indeed
and
does
his
dick
highmightiness
object
to
your
dancing
with
me
dick
of
course
not
he
has
anything
to
do
with
it
i
am
not
going
to
dance
with
you
because
you
are
behaving
abominably
and
you
did
yesterday
and
the
day
before
that
i
think
you
are
nearly
always
abominable
in
fact
still
i
am
one
of
the
best
dancers
in
the
world
it
is
a
temptation
is
it
not
my
own
he
smiled
his
slow
tantalizing
smile
and
in
spite
of
herself
tony
smiled
back
it
is
she
admitted
you
are
a
heavenly
dancer
alan
there
is
no
denying
it
if
you
were
mephisto
himself
i
think
i
would
dance
with
you
occasionally
and
once
relented
tony
there
come
the
others
at
last
and
she
ran
off
down
the
yellow
sands
like
a
modern
atalanta
my
but
tony
is
pretty
murmured
carlotta
to
alan
who
chanced
to
be
standing
near
her
as
her
friend
fluttered
by
with
dick
she
looks
like
a
regular
flame
in
that
scarlet
chiffon
it
is
awfully
daring
but
she
is
wonderful
in
it
she
is
always
wonderful
muttered
alan
moodily
watching
the
slender
graceful
figure
whirl
and
trip
and
flash
down
the
floor
like
a
gay
poppy
petal
caught
in
the
wind
carlotta
turned
something
in
alan
tone
arrested
her
attention
alan
i
believe
it
is
real
with
you
at
last
she
said
up
to
that
moment
she
had
considered
his
affair
with
tony
as
merely
another
of
his
many
adventures
in
romance
albeit
possibly
a
slightly
more
extravagant
one
than
usual
of
course
it
is
real
real
as
hell
he
retorted
i
mad
over
her
carla
i
am
going
to
marry
her
if
i
have
to
kill
every
man
in
the
path
to
get
to
her
savagely
i
am
sorry
alan
you
must
see
tony
is
not
for
the
like
of
you
you
ca
get
to
her
i
wish
you
would
try
dick
and
tony
passed
close
to
them
again
tony
was
smiling
up
at
her
partner
and
he
was
looking
down
at
her
with
a
gaze
that
betrayed
his
caring
neither
saw
alan
and
carlotta
the
savage
light
gleamed
brighter
in
alan
green
eyes
carlotta
is
there
anything
between
them
he
demanded
fiercely
nothing
definite
he
adores
her
of
course
and
she
is
very
fond
of
him
she
feels
as
if
he
sort
of
belonged
to
her
i
think
you
know
the
story
tell
me
briefly
carlotta
outlined
the
tale
of
how
dick
had
taken
refuge
in
the
holiday
barn
when
he
had
run
away
from
the
circus
and
how
tony
had
found
him
sick
and
exhausted
from
fatigue
hunger
and
abuse
how
the
holidays
had
taken
him
in
and
set
him
on
his
feet
and
tony
had
given
him
her
own
middle
name
of
carson
since
he
had
none
of
his
own
alan
listened
intently
did
he
ever
get
any
clue
as
to
his
identity
he
asked
as
carlotta
paused
never
has
he
asked
tony
to
marry
him
i
do
think
so
i
doubt
if
he
ever
does
so
long
as
he
does
know
who
he
is
he
is
very
proud
and
sensitive
and
has
an
almost
superstitious
veneration
for
the
holiday
tradition
being
a
holiday
in
new
england
is
a
little
like
being
of
royal
blood
you
know
i
believe
you
will
ever
have
to
make
a
corpse
of
poor
dick
alan
i
do
mind
making
corpses
i
rather
think
i
should
enjoy
making
one
of
him
i
detest
the
long
lean
animal
had
alan
known
it
dick
had
taken
quite
as
thorough
a
dislike
to
his
magnificent
self
at
that
very
moment
indeed
as
he
and
tony
strolled
in
the
garden
dick
had
remarked
that
he
wished
tony
would
dance
with
that
massey
and
why
not
she
demanded
always
quick
to
resent
dictatorial
airs
because
he
makes
you
well
conspicuous
he
has
any
business
to
dance
with
you
the
way
he
does
you
are
a
professional
but
he
makes
you
look
like
one
thanks
a
compliment
but
still
a
compliment
it
was
meant
for
one
said
dick
soberly
i
hate
it
of
course
you
dance
wonderfully
yourself
it
is
just
dancing
with
you
it
is
poetry
stuff
of
dreams
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
can
see
that
and
i
know
it
must
be
a
temptation
to
have
a
chance
at
a
partner
like
that
lord
tony
no
man
in
every
day
life
has
a
right
to
dance
the
way
he
can
he
castle
i
hate
that
kind
of
a
man
half
woman
there
is
anything
of
a
woman
about
alan
dick
he
is
the
most
virulently
male
man
i
ever
knew
dick
fell
silent
at
that
presently
he
began
again
tony
please
do
be
offended
at
what
i
am
going
to
say
i
know
it
is
none
of
my
business
but
i
wish
you
would
keep
on
with
this
affair
with
massey
why
not
there
was
an
aggressive
sparkle
in
tony
eyes
people
are
talking
i
heard
them
last
night
when
you
were
dancing
with
him
it
hurts
alan
massey
is
the
kind
of
a
man
for
a
girl
like
you
to
flirt
with
stuff
and
nonsense
dicky
any
kind
of
a
man
is
the
kind
for
a
girl
to
flirt
with
if
she
keeps
her
head
but
tony
honestly
this
massey
has
a
good
reputation
how
do
you
know
newspaper
men
know
a
great
deal
they
have
to
besides
alan
massey
is
a
celebrity
he
is
written
up
in
our
files
what
does
that
mean
it
means
that
if
he
should
die
all
we
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
put
in
the
last
flip
the
biographical
data
is
all
on
the
card
ready
to
shoot
dear
me
that
rather
gruesome
is
it
shivered
tony
i
glad
not
a
celebrity
i
hate
to
be
stuck
down
on
your
old
flies
will
i
get
on
alan
card
if
i
keep
on
flirting
with
him
good
lord
i
should
hope
not
i
suppose
i
would
be
in
very
good
company
i
do
mean
alan
i
mean
his
ladies
tony
then
you
know
about
alan
ladies
oh
yes
he
told
me
himself
dick
looked
blank
what
was
a
man
to
do
in
a
case
like
this
finding
his
big
bugaboo
no
bugaboo
at
all
i
know
a
whole
lot
about
alan
massey
maybe
more
than
is
on
your
old
card
i
know
his
mother
was
lucia
vannini
so
beautiful
and
so
gifted
that
she
danced
in
every
court
in
europe
and
was
loved
by
a
prince
i
know
how
cyril
massey
an
american
artist
painted
her
portrait
and
loved
her
and
married
her
i
know
how
she
worshiped
him
and
was
absolutely
faithful
to
him
to
the
day
he
died
when
the
very
light
of
life
went
out
for
her
she
managed
to
live
rather
cheerfully
afterward
even
without
light
if
all
the
stories
about
her
are
true
observed
dick
with
for
him
unusual
cynicism
you
do
understand
she
had
to
live
there
are
other
ways
of
living
than
those
she
chose
not
for
her
she
knew
only
two
things
love
and
dancing
she
was
thrown
from
a
horse
the
next
year
after
her
husband
died
dancing
was
over
for
her
there
was
only
her
beauty
left
her
husband
people
would
have
anything
to
do
with
her
because
she
had
been
a
dancer
and
because
of
the
prince
old
john
massey
cyril
uncle
turned
her
and
her
baby
from
his
door
and
his
cousin
john
and
his
wife
refused
even
to
see
her
she
said
she
would
make
them
hear
of
her
before
she
died
she
did
they
heard
all
right
she
and
her
son
too
must
have
been
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
of
the
masseys
they
were
all
rigid
puritans
i
understand
especially
old
john
serve
him
right
sniffed
tony
they
were
rolling
in
wealth
they
might
have
helped
her
kept
her
from
the
other
thing
they
condemned
so
she
wanted
money
only
for
alan
especially
after
he
began
to
show
that
he
had
more
than
his
father
gifts
she
earned
it
in
the
only
way
she
knew
i
do
blame
her
tony
i
ca
help
it
if
i
am
shocking
you
dick
i
can
understand
why
she
did
it
she
did
care
anything
about
the
lovers
she
never
cared
for
anyone
after
cyril
died
she
gave
herself
for
alan
ca
you
see
that
there
was
something
rather
fine
about
it
i
can
dick
grunted
he
remembered
hearing
something
about
a
woman
whose
sins
were
forgiven
her
because
she
loved
much
but
he
could
reconcile
himself
to
hearing
such
stories
from
tony
holiday
lips
they
were
remote
from
the
clean
sweet
wholesome
atmosphere
in
which
she
belonged
anyway
alan
was
a
wonderful
success
he
studied
in
paris
and
he
had
pictures
on
exhibition
in
salons
over
there
before
he
was
twenty
he
was
fêted
and
courted
and
flattered
and
loved
until
he
thought
the
world
was
his
and
everything
in
it
including
the
ladies
tony
made
a
little
face
at
this
she
did
not
care
for
that
part
of
alan
story
herself
his
mother
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
have
his
head
completely
turned
and
would
lose
all
she
had
gained
so
hard
for
him
so
she
made
him
come
back
to
america
and
settle
down
he
did
he
made
a
great
name
for
himself
before
he
was
as
a
portrait
painter
and
he
and
his
mother
lived
so
happily
together
she
did
need
any
more
lovers
then
alan
was
all
she
needed
and
then
she
died
and
he
went
nearly
crazy
with
grief
went
all
to
pieces
every
way
i
suppose
that
part
of
his
career
is
what
makes
you
say
he
is
fit
for
me
to
flirt
with
dick
nodded
miserably
it
is
very
pleasant
for
me
to
think
of
either
admitted
tony
i
do
like
it
any
better
than
you
do
but
he
is
like
that
any
more
when
old
john
massey
died
without
leaving
any
will
alan
got
all
the
money
because
his
cousin
john
and
his
wife
had
died
too
and
there
was
nobody
else
alan
pulled
up
stakes
and
traveled
all
over
the
world
was
gone
two
years
and
when
he
came
back
he
was
dissipated
any
more
i
do
say
he
is
a
saint
now
he
is
i
know
but
he
got
absolutely
out
of
the
pit
he
was
in
after
his
mother
death
lucky
for
him
they
never
found
the
baby
john
massey
who
was
stolen
dick
remarked
he
would
have
been
the
heir
if
he
could
have
appeared
to
claim
the
money
instead
of
alan
massey
who
was
only
a
grand
nephew
tony
stared
there
was
any
baby
she
exclaimed
oh
yes
there
was
john
massey
junior
had
a
son
john
who
was
kidnapped
when
he
was
asleep
in
the
park
and
deserted
by
his
nurse
who
had
gone
to
flirt
with
a
policeman
there
was
a
great
fuss
made
about
it
at
the
time
the
masseys
offered
fabulous
sums
of
money
for
the
return
of
the
child
but
he
never
turned
up
i
had
to
dig
up
the
story
a
few
years
ago
when
old
john
died
which
is
why
i
know
so
much
about
it
i
do
believe
alan
knew
about
the
baby
he
did
tell
me
anything
about
it
i
wager
he
knew
all
right
it
would
be
mighty
unpleasant
for
him
if
the
other
massey
turned
up
now
dick
i
believe
you
would
be
glad
if
alan
lost
the
money
reproached
tony
why
no
tony
it
nothing
to
me
but
i
always
been
sorry
for
that
other
massey
kid
though
he
does
know
what
he
missed
and
is
probably
a
or
a
janitor
by
this
time
not
knowing
he
is
heir
to
one
of
the
biggest
properties
in
america
sorry
to
disturb
your
theories
er
carson
remarked
alan
massey
suddenly
appearing
on
the
scene
my
cousin
john
happens
to
be
neither
a
nor
a
janitor
but
merely
comfortably
dead
lucky
john
but
dick
said
he
was
dead
at
least
that
nobody
knew
whether
he
was
or
not
objected
tony
unfortunately
your
friend
is
in
error
john
massey
is
entirely
dead
i
assure
you
and
now
if
he
is
quite
through
with
me
and
my
affairs
perhaps
carson
will
excuse
you
come
dear
alan
laid
a
hand
on
tony
arm
with
a
proprietorial
air
which
made
dick
writhe
far
more
than
his
insulting
manner
to
himself
had
done
tony
looked
quickly
from
one
to
the
other
she
hated
the
way
alan
was
behaving
but
she
did
not
want
to
precipitate
a
scene
and
yielded
leaving
dick
with
a
deprecatory
glance
to
go
with
alan
i
do
like
your
manner
she
told
the
latter
you
were
abominably
rude
just
now
forgive
me
sweetheart
i
apologize
that
young
man
of
yours
sets
my
teeth
on
edge
i
ca
abide
a
predestined
parson
i
wager
anything
he
has
been
preaching
at
you
he
smiled
ironically
as
he
saw
the
girl
flush
so
he
did
preach
and
against
me
i
suppose
he
did
and
quite
right
too
you
are
not
at
all
a
proper
person
for
me
to
flirt
with
just
as
he
said
even
miss
lottie
told
me
that
and
when
miss
lottie
objects
to
a
man
it
means
that
she
has
failed
to
hold
him
herself
said
alan
cynically
stop
tony
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
before
we
go
in
i
am
not
a
proper
person
i
told
you
that
myself
there
have
been
other
women
in
my
life
a
good
many
of
them
i
told
you
that
too
but
that
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
you
and
me
i
love
you
you
are
the
only
woman
i
ever
have
loved
in
the
big
sense
at
least
the
only
one
i
have
ever
wanted
to
marry
i
am
like
my
mother
she
had
many
lesser
loves
she
had
only
one
great
one
she
married
him
and
i
shall
marry
you
alan
do
it
is
foolish
worse
than
foolish
to
talk
like
that
my
people
would
never
let
me
marry
you
even
if
i
wanted
to
dick
was
speaking
for
them
just
now
when
he
warned
me
against
you
he
was
speaking
for
himself
damn
him
alan
i
beg
your
pardon
tony
i
a
brute
i
am
sorry
i
trouble
you
any
more
i
wo
even
keep
you
to
your
promise
to
dance
once
with
me
if
you
wish
to
be
let
off
the
music
floated
out
to
them
called
insistently
to
tony
feet
and
warm
young
blood
ah
but
i
do
want
to
dance
with
you
she
sighed
i
do
want
to
be
let
off
come
he
bent
over
her
a
flash
of
triumph
in
his
eyes
my
own
he
exulted
you
are
my
own
kiss
me
belovedest
but
tony
pulled
away
from
him
and
he
followed
her
a
moment
later
the
scarlet
flame
was
in
his
arms
whirling
down
the
hall
to
the
music
of
the
violins
and
dick
standing
apart
by
the
window
watching
tasted
the
dregs
of
the
bitterest
brew
life
had
yet
offered
him
better
far
better
than
tony
holiday
he
knew
where
the
scarlet
flame
was
blowing
his
dance
with
tony
over
alan
retired
to
the
library
where
he
used
the
telephone
to
transmit
a
wire
to
boston
a
message
addressed
to
one
james
roberts
a
retired
circus
performer
chapter
xii
and
there
is
a
flame
when
alan
massey
strayed
into
the
breakfast
room
one
of
the
latest
arrivals
at
that
very
informal
meal
he
found
a
telegram
awaiting
him
it
was
rather
an
odd
message
and
ran
thus
without
capitalization
or
punctuation
town
named
correct
what
is
up
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
sick
alan
frowned
as
he
thrust
the
yellow
envelope
into
his
pocket
does
the
fool
mean
he
is
sick
i
wonder
he
cogitated
lord
i
wish
i
could
let
well
enough
alone
but
this
sword
of
damocles
business
is
beginning
to
get
on
my
nerves
i
have
half
a
mind
to
take
a
run
into
town
this
afternoon
and
see
the
old
reprobate
i
bet
he
does
know
as
much
as
he
claims
to
but
i
like
to
be
sure
before
he
dies
just
then
tony
holiday
entered
clad
in
a
rose
hued
linen
and
looking
like
a
new
blown
rose
herself
you
are
the
latest
ever
greeted
carlotta
on
the
contrary
i
have
been
up
since
the
crack
of
dawn
denied
tony
slipping
into
a
seat
beside
her
friend
carlotta
opened
her
eyes
wide
then
she
understood
you
got
up
to
see
dick
off
she
announced
i
did
please
give
me
some
strawberries
hal
if
you
do
mean
to
eat
the
whole
pyramid
yourself
i
not
only
got
up
but
i
went
to
the
station
not
only
went
to
the
station
but
i
walked
the
whole
mile
and
a
half
can
anybody
beat
that
for
a
morning
record
tony
challenged
as
she
deluged
her
berries
with
cream
alan
massey
uttered
a
kind
of
a
snarling
sound
such
as
a
lion
disturbed
from
a
nap
might
have
emitted
he
had
thought
he
was
through
with
carson
when
the
latter
had
made
his
farewells
the
night
before
saying
goodnight
to
tony
before
them
all
but
tony
had
gotten
up
at
some
ridiculously
early
hour
to
escort
him
to
the
station
and
did
not
mind
everybody
knowing
it
he
subsided
into
a
dense
mood
of
gloom
the
morning
had
begun
badly
later
he
discovered
tony
in
the
rose
garden
with
a
big
basket
on
her
arm
and
a
charming
drooping
sun
hat
shading
her
even
more
charming
face
she
waved
him
away
as
he
approached
go
away
she
ordered
i
busy
you
mean
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
be
disagreeable
to
me
he
retorted
lighting
a
cigarette
and
looking
as
if
he
meant
to
fight
it
out
along
that
line
if
it
took
all
summer
tony
snipped
off
a
rose
with
her
big
shears
and
dropped
it
into
her
basket
it
rather
looked
as
if
she
were
meaning
to
snip
off
alan
massey
figuratively
in
much
the
same
ruthless
manner
put
it
that
way
if
you
like
only
stay
away
i
mean
it
why
he
persisted
thus
pressed
she
turned
and
faced
him
it
is
a
lovely
morning
all
blue
and
gold
and
after
last
night
storm
a
good
morning
i
feeling
good
too
the
clean
morning
has
got
inside
of
me
and
when
you
come
near
me
i
feel
a
pricking
in
my
thumbs
you
do
fit
into
my
present
mood
please
go
alan
i
am
perfectly
serious
i
do
want
to
talk
to
you
what
have
i
done
i
am
no
different
from
what
i
was
yesterday
i
know
it
is
anything
you
have
done
it
is
you
at
all
it
is
i
who
am
different
or
want
to
be
tony
spoke
earnestly
she
was
perfectly
sincere
she
did
want
to
be
different
she
had
not
slept
well
the
night
before
she
had
thought
a
great
deal
about
holiday
hill
and
uncle
phil
and
her
brothers
and
well
yes
about
dick
carson
they
all
armed
her
against
alan
massey
alan
threw
away
his
cigarette
with
an
angry
gesture
you
ca
play
fast
and
loose
with
me
tony
holiday
you
have
been
leading
me
on
playing
the
devil
with
me
for
days
you
know
you
have
now
you
are
scared
and
want
to
get
back
to
shallow
water
it
is
too
late
you
are
in
deep
seas
and
you
got
to
stay
there
with
me
i
have
to
do
anything
alan
you
are
claiming
more
than
you
have
any
right
to
claim
but
he
came
nearer
towered
above
her
almost
menacingly
because
that
nameless
fool
of
a
reporter
with
his
sanctimonious
airs
and
impeccable
morals
has
put
you
against
me
you
want
to
sack
me
you
do
it
last
night
you
were
ready
to
go
any
lengths
with
me
you
know
it
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
be
balked
by
a
miserable
circus
brat
a
mere
nobody
not
so
long
as
i
am
alan
massey
count
on
that
tony
dark
eyes
were
ablaze
with
anger
stop
there
alan
you
are
saying
things
that
are
not
true
and
i
forbid
you
ever
to
speak
of
dick
like
that
again
to
me
indeed
and
how
are
you
going
to
prevent
my
saying
what
i
please
about
your
precious
protégé
sneered
alan
i
shall
tell
carlotta
i
wo
stay
under
the
same
roof
with
anybody
who
insults
my
friends
you
wo
have
to
restrain
yourself
long
in
any
case
i
am
leaving
saturday
perhaps
sooner
tony
the
sneer
died
away
from
alan
face
which
had
suddenly
grown
white
you
must
go
i
ca
live
without
you
my
darling
if
you
knew
how
i
worshiped
you
how
i
can
not
sleep
of
nights
for
wanting
you
you
would
talk
of
going
away
from
me
i
was
brutal
just
now
i
admit
it
it
is
because
i
love
you
so
the
thought
of
your
turning
from
me
deserting
me
maddened
me
i
am
not
responsible
for
what
i
said
you
must
forgive
me
but
oh
my
belovedest
you
are
mine
do
try
to
deny
it
we
have
belonged
to
each
other
for
always
you
know
it
you
feel
it
i
have
seen
the
knowledge
in
your
eyes
felt
it
flutter
in
your
heart
will
you
marry
me
tony
holiday
you
shall
be
loved
as
no
woman
was
ever
loved
you
shall
be
my
queen
i
will
be
true
to
you
forever
and
ever
your
slave
your
mate
tony
tony
say
yes
you
must
but
tony
drew
back
from
him
frightened
repulsed
shocked
by
the
storm
of
his
passion
which
shook
him
as
mighty
trees
are
shaken
by
tempests
she
shrank
from
the
hungry
fires
in
his
eyes
from
the
abandon
and
fierceness
of
his
wooing
it
was
an
alien
disturbing
dreadful
thing
to
her
do
she
implored
you
must
love
me
like
that
alan
you
must
not
how
can
i
help
it
sweetheart
i
am
no
iceberg
i
am
a
man
and
you
are
the
one
woman
in
the
world
for
me
i
love
you
love
you
i
want
you
going
to
have
you
make
you
mine
marry
you
bell
and
book
what
you
will
so
long
as
you
are
mine
mine
mine
tony
set
down
her
basket
clasped
her
hands
behind
her
and
stood
looking
straight
up
into
his
face
listen
alan
i
can
not
marry
you
i
could
even
if
i
loved
you
and
i
do
think
i
do
love
you
though
you
fascinate
me
and
when
we
are
dancing
i
forget
all
the
other
things
in
you
that
i
hate
i
have
been
very
foolish
and
maybe
unkind
to
let
it
go
on
so
far
i
did
quite
know
what
i
was
doing
girls
do
know
that
is
why
they
play
with
men
as
they
do
they
do
mean
to
be
cruel
they
just
do
know
but
you
know
now
my
tony
his
dark
stormy
face
was
very
close
to
hers
tony
felt
her
heart
leap
but
she
did
not
flinch
nor
pull
away
this
time
yes
alan
i
know
in
a
way
at
least
we
must
go
on
like
this
it
is
bad
for
us
both
i
tell
carlotta
i
am
going
home
you
want
to
go
away
from
me
the
haunting
music
of
his
voice
more
moving
in
its
hurt
than
in
its
mastery
of
mood
stirred
tony
holiday
profoundly
but
she
steadied
herself
by
a
strong
effort
of
will
she
must
not
let
him
sweep
her
away
from
her
moorings
she
must
not
she
must
remember
holiday
hill
very
hard
i
have
to
alan
she
said
i
am
very
sorry
if
i
have
hurt
you
am
hurting
you
but
i
ca
marry
you
that
is
final
the
sooner
we
end
things
the
better
by
god
it
is
final
it
never
will
be
so
long
as
you
and
i
are
both
alive
you
will
come
to
me
of
your
own
accord
you
will
love
me
you
do
love
me
now
but
you
are
letting
the
world
come
in
between
where
it
has
no
right
to
come
i
tell
you
you
are
mine
mine
no
no
denied
tony
and
i
say
yes
my
love
you
are
my
love
i
have
set
my
seal
upon
you
you
can
go
away
back
to
your
hill
but
you
will
not
be
happy
without
me
you
will
never
forget
me
for
a
waking
moment
you
can
not
you
are
a
part
of
me
forever
there
was
something
solemn
inexorable
in
alan
tones
a
strange
fear
clutched
at
tony
heart
was
he
right
could
she
never
forget
him
would
he
always
be
a
part
of
her
forever
no
that
was
nonsense
how
could
it
be
true
how
could
he
have
set
his
seal
upon
her
when
he
had
never
even
kissed
her
she
would
not
let
him
hypnotize
her
into
believing
his
prophecy
she
stooped
mechanically
to
pick
up
her
roses
and
remembered
the
story
of
persephone
gathering
lilies
in
the
vale
of
enna
and
suddenly
borne
off
by
the
coal
black
horses
of
dis
to
the
dark
kingdom
of
the
lower
world
was
she
persephone
had
she
eaten
of
the
pomegranate
seeds
while
she
danced
night
after
night
in
alan
massey
arms
no
she
would
not
believe
it
she
was
free
she
would
exile
alan
massey
from
her
heart
and
life
she
must
this
resolve
was
in
her
eyes
as
she
lifted
them
to
alan
the
fire
had
died
out
of
his
now
and
his
face
was
gray
and
drawn
in
the
sunshine
his
mood
had
changed
as
his
moods
so
often
did
swiftly
forgive
me
tony
he
said
humbly
i
have
troubled
you
frightened
you
i
am
sorry
you
need
go
away
i
will
go
i
do
want
to
spoil
one
moment
of
happiness
for
you
i
never
shall
except
when
the
devil
is
in
me
please
try
to
remember
that
say
always
loves
me
no
matter
what
he
does
or
says
he
loves
me
his
love
is
real
if
nothing
else
about
him
is
you
do
believe
that
do
you
dearest
he
pleaded
i
do
alan
i
have
always
believed
it
i
think
ever
since
that
first
night
though
i
have
tried
not
to
i
am
very
sorry
though
love
your
kind
of
love
is
a
fearful
thing
i
am
afraid
of
it
it
is
fearful
but
beautiful
too
very
beautiful
like
fire
did
you
ever
think
what
a
strange
dual
element
fire
is
it
consumes
is
a
force
of
destruction
but
it
also
purifies
burns
out
dross
love
is
like
that
my
tony
mine
for
you
may
damn
me
forever
or
it
may
take
me
to
the
very
gate
of
heaven
i
do
know
myself
which
it
will
be
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
strange
kind
of
illumination
on
his
face
a
look
almost
of
spiritual
exaltation
it
awed
tony
bereft
her
of
words
this
was
a
new
alan
massey
an
alan
massey
she
had
never
seen
before
and
she
found
herself
looking
up
instead
of
down
at
him
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
hand
reverently
as
a
devotee
might
pay
homage
at
the
shrine
of
a
saint
i
shall
not
see
you
again
until
tony
i
am
going
into
town
but
i
shall
be
back
for
one
more
dance
with
you
heart
dearest
and
then
i
promise
i
will
go
away
and
leave
you
tomorrow
you
will
dance
with
me
tony
once
we
shall
have
that
one
perfect
thing
to
remember
tony
bowed
assent
and
in
a
moment
she
was
alone
with
her
roses
that
afternoon
she
shut
herself
in
her
room
to
write
letters
to
the
home
people
whom
she
had
neglected
badly
of
late
every
moment
had
been
so
full
since
she
had
come
to
carlotta
there
had
been
so
little
time
to
write
and
when
she
had
written
it
had
given
little
of
what
she
was
really
living
and
feeling
just
the
mere
externals
and
not
all
of
them
as
she
was
very
well
aware
they
would
never
understand
her
relation
with
alan
they
would
disapprove
just
as
dick
had
disapproved
perhaps
she
did
not
understand
herself
why
she
had
let
herself
get
so
deeply
entangled
in
something
which
could
not
go
on
something
which
was
the
profoundest
folly
if
nothing
worse
the
morning
had
crystallized
her
fear
of
the
growing
complication
of
the
situation
she
was
glad
alan
was
going
away
glad
she
had
had
the
strength
of
will
to
deny
him
his
will
glad
that
she
could
now
after
come
back
into
undisputed
possession
of
the
kingdom
of
herself
but
in
her
heart
she
was
gladder
that
there
was
and
that
one
last
dance
with
alan
massey
before
life
became
simple
and
sane
and
tame
again
and
alan
and
his
wild
love
passed
out
of
it
forever
she
finished
her
letters
which
were
not
very
satisfactory
after
all
how
could
one
write
real
letters
when
one
pen
was
writing
one
thing
and
one
thoughts
were
darting
hither
and
thither
about
very
different
business
she
threw
herself
in
the
chaise
longue
not
yet
ready
to
dress
and
go
down
to
join
the
others
there
was
nobody
there
she
cared
to
talk
to
somehow
alan
was
not
there
nobody
else
mattered
it
had
come
to
that
idly
she
picked
up
a
volume
of
verse
that
lay
beside
her
on
the
table
and
fluttered
its
pages
seeking
something
to
meet
her
restless
mood
presently
in
her
vagrant
seeking
she
chanced
upon
a
little
poem
a
poem
she
read
and
reread
twice
three
times
for
there
is
a
flame
that
has
blown
too
near
and
there
is
a
name
that
has
grown
too
dear
and
there
is
a
fear
and
to
the
still
hills
and
cool
earth
and
far
sky
i
make
moan
the
heart
in
my
bosom
is
not
my
own
oh
would
i
were
free
as
the
wind
on
wing
love
is
a
terrible
thing
tony
laid
the
book
face
down
upon
the
table
still
open
at
the
little
verse
the
shadows
were
growing
long
out
there
in
the
dusk
the
late
afternoon
sun
was
pale
honey
color
a
soft
little
breeze
stirred
the
branches
of
a
weeping
willow
tree
and
set
them
to
swaying
languorously
unseen
birds
twittered
happily
among
the
shrubbery
a
golden
butterfly
poised
for
a
moment
above
the
white
holly
hocks
and
then
drifted
off
over
the
flaming
scarlet
poppies
and
was
lost
to
sight
it
was
all
so
beautiful
so
serene
she
felt
that
it
should
have
come
like
a
benediction
cooling
the
fever
of
her
tired
mind
but
it
did
not
it
could
not
even
drive
the
words
of
the
poem
out
of
her
head
oh
would
i
were
free
as
the
wind
on
wing
love
is
a
terrible
thing
chapter
xiii
bitter
fruit
from
the
north
station
in
boston
alan
massey
directed
his
course
to
a
small
cigar
store
on
atlantic
avenue
a
black
eyed
italian
lad
in
attendance
behind
the
counter
looked
up
as
he
entered
and
surveyed
him
with
grave
scrutiny
i
am
massey
announced
alan
roberts
is
expecting
me
i
wired
jim
sick
said
the
boy
briefly
i
am
sorry
i
hope
he
is
not
too
sick
to
see
me
naw
he
see
you
he
wants
to
the
speaker
motioned
alan
to
follow
him
to
the
rear
of
the
store
together
they
mounted
some
narrow
stairs
passed
through
a
hallway
and
into
a
bedroom
a
disorderly
dingy
obviously
affair
on
the
bed
lay
a
large
framed
exceedingly
ugly
looking
man
his
flesh
was
yellow
and
sagged
loosely
away
from
his
big
bones
the
impression
he
gave
was
one
of
huge
animal
bulk
shriveling
away
in
an
unlovely
manner
getting
ready
to
disintegrate
entirely
the
man
was
sick
undoubtedly
possibly
dying
he
looked
it
the
door
shut
with
a
soft
click
the
two
men
were
alone
hello
jim
alan
approached
the
bed
bad
as
this
i
am
sorry
he
spoke
with
the
careless
easy
friendliness
he
could
assume
when
it
suited
him
the
man
grinned
faintly
ironically
the
grin
did
not
lessen
the
ugliness
of
his
face
rather
accentuated
it
it
not
so
bad
he
drawled
nothing
but
death
and
what
that
i
do
suffer
much
not
now
it
cancer
keeps
gnawing
away
like
a
rat
in
the
wall
by
and
by
it
will
get
up
to
my
heart
and
then
it
jim
i
sha
care
what
life
good
for
that
a
chap
should
cling
to
it
like
a
barnacle
on
a
rock
we
do
though
said
alan
massey
oh
yes
we
do
it
the
way
we
made
we
are
always
clinging
to
something
good
or
bad
life
love
home
drink
power
money
always
something
we
are
ready
to
sell
our
souls
to
get
or
keep
with
you
and
me
it
was
money
you
sold
your
soul
to
me
to
keep
money
and
i
took
it
to
get
money
he
laughed
raucously
and
alan
winced
at
the
sound
and
cursed
the
morbid
curiosity
that
had
brought
him
to
the
bedside
of
this
man
who
for
three
years
past
had
held
his
own
future
in
his
dirty
hand
or
claimed
to
hold
it
alan
massey
had
paid
paid
high
for
the
privilege
of
not
knowing
things
he
did
not
wish
to
know
what
kind
of
a
trail
had
you
struck
when
you
wired
me
massey
i
know
you
were
anxious
for
details
about
young
john
massey
career
i
thought
you
preferred
ignorance
it
was
what
you
bought
of
me
i
know
it
was
groaned
alan
dropping
into
a
creaking
rocker
beside
the
bed
i
am
a
fool
i
admit
it
but
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
i
ca
stand
not
knowing
i
want
to
squeeze
what
you
know
out
of
you
as
you
would
squeeze
a
lemon
until
there
was
nothing
left
but
bitter
pulp
it
is
driving
me
mad
the
sick
man
eyed
the
speaker
with
a
leer
of
malicious
satisfaction
it
was
meat
to
his
soul
to
see
this
lordly
young
aristocrat
racked
with
misery
and
dread
to
hold
him
in
his
power
as
a
cat
holds
a
mouse
which
it
can
crush
and
crunch
at
any
moment
if
it
will
alan
massey
mood
filled
jim
roberts
with
exquisite
enjoyment
enjoyment
such
as
a
gourmand
feels
on
setting
his
teeth
in
some
rare
morsel
of
food
i
know
he
nodded
it
works
like
that
often
they
say
a
murderer
keep
away
from
the
scene
of
his
crime
if
he
is
left
at
large
there
is
an
irresistible
fascination
to
him
about
the
spot
where
he
damned
his
immortal
soul
i
not
a
criminal
snarled
alan
do
talk
to
me
like
that
or
you
will
never
see
another
cent
of
my
money
money
sneered
the
sick
man
what
that
to
me
now
i
lost
my
taste
for
money
it
is
no
good
to
me
any
more
i
got
enough
laid
by
to
bury
me
and
i
ca
take
the
rest
with
me
your
money
is
nothing
to
me
alan
massey
but
you
pay
still
in
a
different
way
i
am
glad
you
came
it
is
doing
me
good
alan
made
a
gesture
of
disgust
and
got
to
his
feet
pacing
to
and
fro
his
face
dark
his
soul
torn
between
conflicting
emotions
i
be
dead
soon
went
on
the
malicious
purring
voice
from
the
bed
do
begrudge
me
my
last
fling
when
i
am
in
my
grave
you
will
be
safe
nobody
in
the
living
world
but
me
knows
young
john
massey
alive
you
can
keep
your
money
then
with
perfect
ease
of
mind
until
you
get
to
where
i
am
now
and
then
maybe
you
will
find
out
the
money
will
comfort
you
no
longer
that
nothing
but
having
a
soul
can
get
you
over
the
river
the
younger
man
march
came
to
a
halt
by
the
bedside
you
sha
die
until
you
tell
me
what
you
know
about
john
massey
he
said
fiercely
you
a
fool
said
james
roberts
what
you
do
know
you
are
not
responsible
for
you
can
forget
in
a
way
if
you
insist
on
hearing
the
whole
story
you
will
never
be
able
to
get
away
from
it
to
your
dying
day
john
massey
as
an
abstraction
is
one
thing
john
massey
as
a
live
human
being
whom
you
have
cheated
out
of
a
name
and
a
fortune
is
another
i
never
cheated
him
of
a
name
you
did
that
the
man
grunted
right
that
is
on
my
bill
lord
knows
i
wish
it
was
little
enough
did
i
ever
get
out
of
that
particular
piece
of
deviltry
i
myself
was
a
darned
little
bit
too
smart
i
held
on
to
the
boy
thinking
i
get
more
out
of
it
later
and
he
slid
out
of
my
hands
like
an
eel
and
i
had
nothing
to
show
for
it
until
you
came
along
and
i
saw
a
chance
to
make
a
new
deal
at
your
expense
you
fell
for
it
like
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
i
never
forget
your
face
when
i
told
you
john
massey
was
alive
and
that
i
could
produce
him
in
a
minute
for
the
courts
if
i
had
your
name
would
have
been
dutch
young
man
you
never
have
gotten
a
look
in
on
the
money
you
had
the
sense
to
see
that
old
john
died
without
a
will
his
grandson
and
not
his
was
his
heir
provided
anybody
could
dig
up
the
fellow
and
i
was
the
boy
that
could
do
that
i
proved
that
to
you
alan
massey
you
proved
nothing
you
scared
me
into
handing
you
over
a
whole
lot
of
money
you
blackmailing
rascal
i
admit
that
but
you
did
prove
anything
you
showed
me
the
baby
clothes
you
said
john
massey
wore
when
he
was
stolen
the
name
might
easily
enough
have
been
stamped
on
the
linen
later
you
showed
me
a
silver
rattle
marked
massey
the
inscription
might
also
easily
enough
have
been
added
later
at
a
convenience
you
showed
me
some
letters
purporting
to
have
been
written
by
the
woman
who
stole
the
child
and
was
too
much
frightened
by
her
crime
to
get
the
gains
she
planned
to
win
from
it
the
letters
too
might
easily
have
been
forgery
the
whole
thing
might
have
been
a
cock
and
bull
story
fabricated
by
a
rotten
clever
mind
like
yours
to
apply
the
money
screw
to
me
true
chuckled
jim
roberts
quite
true
i
wondered
at
your
credulity
at
the
time
you
rat
so
it
was
all
a
fake
a
trap
you
would
like
to
believe
that
would
you
you
would
like
to
have
a
dying
man
oath
that
there
was
nothing
but
a
pack
of
lies
to
the
whole
thing
blackmail
of
the
crudest
most
unsupportable
variety
alan
bent
over
the
man
shook
his
fist
in
the
evil
withered
old
face
damn
you
jim
roberts
was
it
a
lie
or
was
it
not
keep
your
hands
off
me
alan
massey
it
was
the
truth
sarah
nelson
did
steal
the
child
just
as
i
told
you
she
gave
the
child
to
me
when
she
was
dying
a
few
months
later
i
give
my
oath
on
that
if
you
like
alan
brushed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
sat
down
again
limply
in
the
creaking
rocker
oh
you
are
willing
to
believe
that
again
now
are
you
mocked
roberts
i
got
to
i
suppose
go
on
tell
me
the
rest
i
got
to
know
did
you
really
make
a
circus
brat
of
john
massey
and
did
he
really
run
away
from
you
that
is
all
you
told
me
before
you
remember
it
was
all
you
wanted
to
know
besides
the
man
smiled
his
diabolical
grin
again
there
was
a
reason
for
going
light
on
the
details
at
the
time
i
held
you
up
i
had
any
more
idea
than
you
had
where
john
massey
was
nor
whether
he
was
even
alive
it
was
the
weak
spot
in
my
armor
but
you
were
so
panic
stricken
at
the
thought
of
having
to
give
up
your
gentleman
fortune
that
you
never
looked
at
the
hollowness
of
the
thing
you
could
have
bowled
over
my
whole
scheme
in
a
minute
by
being
honest
and
telling
me
to
bring
on
your
cousin
john
massey
but
you
did
you
were
only
too
afraid
i
would
bring
him
on
before
you
could
buy
me
off
i
knew
i
could
count
on
your
being
blind
and
rotten
i
knew
my
man
then
you
do
know
now
whether
john
massey
is
alive
or
not
alan
asked
after
a
pause
during
which
he
let
the
full
irony
of
the
man
confession
sink
into
his
heart
and
turn
there
like
a
knife
in
a
wound
that
is
where
you
dead
wrong
i
do
know
i
made
it
my
business
to
find
out
it
was
too
important
to
have
an
invulnerable
shield
not
to
patch
up
the
discrepancy
as
early
as
possible
it
took
me
a
year
to
get
my
facts
and
it
cost
a
good
chink
of
the
filthy
but
i
got
them
i
not
only
know
that
john
massey
is
alive
but
i
know
where
he
is
and
what
he
is
doing
i
could
send
for
him
and
cook
your
goose
for
you
forever
young
man
he
pulled
himself
up
on
one
elbow
to
peer
into
alan
gloomy
face
i
may
do
it
yet
he
added
you
need
offer
me
hush
money
it
no
good
to
me
as
i
told
you
i
do
want
money
i
only
want
to
pass
the
time
until
the
reaper
comes
along
you
grant
that
it
would
be
amusing
to
me
to
watch
the
tip
once
more
to
see
you
go
down
and
your
cousin
john
come
up
alan
was
on
his
feet
again
now
striding
nervously
from
door
to
window
and
back
again
he
had
wanted
to
know
now
he
knew
he
had
knowledge
bitter
as
wormwood
the
man
had
lied
before
he
was
not
lying
now
what
made
you
send
that
wire
were
you
on
the
track
too
trying
to
find
out
on
your
own
where
your
cousin
is
not
exactly
lord
knows
i
did
want
to
know
but
i
had
a
queer
hunch
some
coincidences
bobbed
up
under
my
nose
that
i
did
like
the
looks
of
i
met
a
young
man
a
few
days
ago
that
was
about
the
age
john
would
have
been
a
chap
with
a
past
who
had
run
away
from
a
circus
the
thing
stuck
in
my
crop
especially
as
there
was
a
kind
of
shadowy
resemblance
between
us
that
people
noticed
that
is
interesting
and
his
name
he
goes
under
the
name
of
carson
richard
carson
roberts
nodded
the
same
good
boy
you
have
succeeded
in
finding
your
cousin
congratulations
he
cackled
maliciously
then
it
really
is
he
not
a
doubt
of
it
he
was
taken
up
by
a
family
named
holiday
in
dunbury
massachusetts
they
gave
him
a
home
saw
that
he
got
some
schooling
started
him
on
a
country
newspaper
he
was
smart
took
to
books
got
ahead
was
promoted
from
one
paper
to
another
he
is
on
a
new
york
daily
now
making
good
still
i
told
does
it
tally
alan
bowed
assent
it
tallied
all
too
well
the
lad
he
had
insulted
jeered
at
hated
with
instinctive
hate
was
his
cousin
john
massey
the
third
whom
he
had
told
the
other
was
quite
dead
john
massey
was
very
much
alive
and
was
the
rightful
heir
to
the
fortune
which
alan
massey
was
spending
as
the
heavens
had
spent
rain
yesterday
it
was
worse
than
that
if
the
other
was
no
longer
nameless
had
the
right
to
the
same
fine
old
name
that
alan
himself
bore
and
had
too
often
disgraced
the
barrier
between
him
and
tony
holiday
was
swept
away
that
was
the
bitterest
drop
in
the
cup
no
wonder
he
hated
dick
hated
him
now
with
a
cumulative
almost
murderous
intensity
he
had
mocked
at
the
other
but
how
should
he
stand
against
him
in
fair
field
it
was
he
alan
massey
that
was
the
outcast
his
mother
a
woman
of
doubtful
fame
himself
a
follower
of
false
fires
his
life
ignoble
wayward
erratic
unclean
would
it
not
be
john
rather
than
alan
massey
tony
holiday
would
choose
if
she
knew
all
this
ugly
venomous
old
rascal
held
his
fate
in
the
hollow
of
his
evil
old
hand
the
other
was
watching
him
narrowly
evidently
striving
to
follow
his
thoughts
well
he
asked
going
to
beat
me
at
my
own
game
give
your
cousin
his
due
no
curtly
queer
mused
the
man
a
month
ago
i
would
have
understood
it
it
would
have
seemed
sensible
enough
to
hold
on
to
the
cold
cash
at
any
risk
now
it
looks
different
money
is
filthy
stuff
man
it
is
what
they
put
on
dead
to
keep
them
down
sometimes
we
put
it
on
our
own
living
lids
to
keep
us
from
seeing
straight
you
are
sure
the
money
worth
so
much
to
you
alan
massey
the
man
eyes
burned
livid
like
coals
it
was
a
strange
and
rather
sickening
thing
alan
massey
thought
to
hear
him
talk
like
this
after
having
lived
the
rottenest
kind
of
a
life
sunk
in
slime
for
years
the
money
is
nothing
to
me
he
flung
back
not
now
i
thought
it
was
worth
considerable
when
i
drove
that
devilish
bargain
with
you
to
keep
it
it
has
been
worse
than
nothing
if
you
care
to
know
it
killed
my
art
the
only
decent
thing
about
me
the
only
thing
i
had
a
right
to
take
honest
pride
in
john
massey
might
have
every
penny
of
it
for
all
i
care
if
that
were
all
there
were
to
it
what
else
is
there
probed
the
old
man
none
of
your
business
snarled
alan
not
for
worlds
would
he
have
spoken
tony
holiday
name
in
this
spot
under
the
baleful
gleam
of
those
dying
eyes
the
man
chuckled
maliciously
you
do
need
to
tell
me
i
know
there
always
a
woman
in
it
when
a
man
takes
the
path
to
hell
does
she
want
money
is
that
why
you
must
hang
on
to
the
filthy
stuff
she
does
want
anything
except
what
i
ca
give
her
thanks
to
you
and
myself
the
love
of
a
decent
man
i
see
when
we
meet
woman
we
wish
we
sowed
fewer
wild
oats
i
went
through
that
myself
once
she
was
a
white
lily
sort
of
girl
and
i
well
i
gone
the
pace
long
before
i
met
her
i
was
fit
to
touch
her
and
i
knew
it
i
went
down
fast
after
that
nothing
to
keep
me
back
old
shakespeare
says
something
somewhere
about
our
pleasant
vices
beings
whips
to
goad
us
with
you
and
i
can
understand
that
alan
massey
both
felt
the
lash
alan
made
an
impatient
gesture
he
did
not
care
to
be
lumped
with
this
rotten
piece
of
flesh
lying
there
before
him
i
suppose
you
are
wondering
what
my
next
move
is
went
on
roberts
i
do
care
oh
yes
you
do
you
care
a
good
deal
i
can
break
you
alan
massey
and
you
know
it
go
ahead
and
break
and
be
damned
if
you
choose
raged
alan
exactly
as
i
choose
and
i
can
keep
you
dancing
on
some
mighty
hot
gridirons
before
i
shuffle
off
do
forget
that
alan
massey
and
there
will
be
several
months
to
dance
yet
if
the
doctors
are
off
their
count
suit
yourself
do
hurry
about
dying
on
my
account
said
alan
with
ironical
courtesy
a
few
moments
later
he
was
on
his
way
back
to
the
station
his
universe
reeled
all
he
was
sure
was
that
he
loved
tony
holiday
and
would
fight
to
the
last
ditch
to
win
and
keep
her
and
that
she
would
be
in
his
arms
for
perhaps
the
last
time
the
rest
was
a
hideous
blur
chapter
xiv
shackles
the
evening
was
a
specially
gala
occasion
with
a
dinner
dance
on
the
last
big
party
before
tony
went
home
to
her
hill
the
great
ball
room
at
crest
house
had
been
decorated
with
a
network
of
greenery
and
crimson
rambler
roses
a
orchestra
had
been
brought
down
from
the
city
the
girls
had
saved
their
prettiest
gowns
and
looked
their
rainbow
loveliest
for
the
crowning
event
tony
was
wearing
an
exquisite
white
chiffon
and
silver
creation
with
silver
slippers
and
a
silver
fillet
binding
her
dark
hair
alan
had
sent
her
some
wonderful
orchids
tied
with
silver
ribbon
and
these
she
wore
but
no
jewelry
whatever
not
even
a
ring
there
was
something
particularly
radiant
about
her
young
loveliness
that
night
the
young
men
hovered
about
her
like
honey
bees
about
a
rose
and
at
every
dance
they
cut
in
and
cut
in
until
her
white
and
silver
seemed
to
be
drifting
from
one
pair
of
arms
to
another
tony
was
very
gay
and
bountiful
and
impartial
in
her
smiles
and
favors
but
all
the
time
she
waited
knowing
that
presently
would
come
the
one
dance
to
which
there
would
be
no
cutting
in
the
dance
that
would
make
the
others
seem
nothing
but
shadows
by
and
by
the
hour
struck
she
saw
alan
leave
his
place
by
the
window
where
he
had
been
moodily
lounging
saw
him
come
toward
her
taller
than
any
man
in
the
room
distinguished
a
king
among
the
rest
it
seemed
to
tony
waiting
longing
for
his
coming
yet
half
dreading
it
too
for
the
sooner
he
came
the
sooner
it
must
all
end
she
was
with
hal
at
the
moment
waiting
for
the
music
to
begin
but
as
alan
approached
she
turned
to
her
companion
with
a
quick
appeal
in
her
eyes
and
a
warm
flush
on
her
cheeks
i
am
sorry
hal
she
said
low
in
his
ear
but
this
is
alan
he
is
going
away
forgive
me
hal
turned
stared
at
alan
massey
turned
back
to
tony
bowed
and
moved
away
hanged
if
there
is
something
magnificent
about
the
fellow
he
thought
no
matter
how
you
detest
him
there
is
something
about
him
that
gets
you
i
wonder
how
far
he
has
gone
with
tony
gee
it
a
rotten
combination
but
lordy
how
they
can
dance
those
two
never
as
long
as
she
lived
was
tony
holiday
to
forget
that
dance
with
alan
massey
as
a
musician
pours
himself
into
his
violin
as
a
poet
puts
his
soul
into
his
sonnet
as
a
sculptor
chisels
his
dream
in
marble
so
her
companion
flung
his
passion
and
despair
and
imploring
into
his
dancing
they
forgot
the
others
forgot
everything
but
themselves
they
might
have
been
dancing
alone
on
the
top
of
olympus
for
all
either
knew
or
cared
for
the
rest
of
the
world
it
was
alan
not
tony
who
brought
it
to
an
end
however
he
whispered
something
in
the
girl
ear
and
their
feet
paused
in
a
moment
he
was
holding
open
the
french
window
for
her
to
pass
out
into
the
night
the
white
and
silver
vanished
like
a
cloud
alan
massey
followed
the
window
swung
shut
again
the
music
stopped
abruptly
as
if
now
its
inspiration
had
come
to
an
end
a
single
note
of
a
violin
quivered
off
into
silence
after
the
others
like
the
breath
of
beauty
itself
passing
carlotta
and
her
aunt
happened
to
be
standing
near
each
other
the
eyes
were
troubled
she
wished
alan
had
not
come
back
at
all
from
the
city
she
hoped
he
really
intended
to
go
away
as
he
had
told
her
more
than
all
she
hoped
she
was
right
in
believing
that
tony
had
refused
to
marry
him
like
dick
carlotta
had
reverence
for
the
holiday
tradition
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
tony
marrying
alan
she
felt
woefully
responsible
for
having
brought
the
two
together
did
you
say
he
was
going
asked
her
aunt
carlotta
nodded
he
wo
go
prophesied
miss
cressy
oh
yes
i
think
he
will
i
do
know
for
certain
but
i
have
an
idea
she
refused
him
this
morning
ah
but
that
was
this
morning
things
look
very
different
by
star
light
that
child
ought
not
to
be
out
there
with
him
she
is
losing
her
head
aunt
lottie
alan
is
a
gentleman
demurred
carlotta
miss
lottie
smiled
satirically
her
smile
repeated
ted
holiday
verdict
that
some
gentlemen
were
rotters
you
forget
my
dear
that
i
knew
alan
massey
when
you
and
tony
were
in
short
petticoats
and
pigtails
you
ca
trust
too
much
to
his
gentlemanliness
of
course
i
know
he
is
a
saint
admitted
carlotta
but
you
understand
it
is
real
with
alan
this
time
he
really
cares
it
just
just
the
one
thing
it
is
always
the
one
thing
with
alan
massey
kind
i
know
what
i
am
talking
about
carlotta
he
was
a
little
in
love
with
me
once
i
dare
say
we
both
thought
it
was
different
at
the
time
it
was
it
was
pretty
much
the
same
thing
do
cherish
any
romantic
notions
about
love
carlotta
there
is
any
love
as
you
mean
it
oh
yes
there
is
denied
carlotta
suddenly
a
little
fiercely
there
is
love
but
most
of
us
are
are
worthy
of
it
it
is
too
big
for
us
that
is
why
we
get
the
cheap
stuff
it
is
all
we
are
fit
for
miss
carlotta
stared
at
her
niece
but
before
she
could
speak
hal
underwood
had
claimed
the
latter
for
a
dance
h
m
she
mused
looking
after
the
two
so
even
carlotta
is
immune
i
wonder
who
he
was
meanwhile
out
in
the
garden
tony
and
alan
had
strayed
over
to
the
fountain
just
as
they
had
that
first
evening
after
that
first
dance
tony
belovedest
let
me
speak
listen
to
me
just
once
more
you
do
love
me
do
lie
to
me
with
your
lips
when
your
eyes
told
me
the
truth
in
there
you
are
mine
mine
my
beautiful
my
love
all
mine
he
drew
her
into
his
arms
not
passionately
but
gently
it
was
his
gentleness
that
conquered
a
storm
of
unrestrained
emotion
would
have
driven
her
away
from
him
but
his
sudden
quiet
strength
and
tenderness
melted
her
last
reservation
she
gave
her
lips
unresisting
to
his
kiss
and
with
that
kiss
desire
of
freedom
and
all
fear
left
her
for
the
moment
at
least
love
was
all
and
enough
tony
my
belovedest
he
whispered
say
it
just
once
tell
me
you
love
me
it
was
the
old
old
plea
but
in
tony
ears
it
was
immortally
new
i
love
you
alan
i
did
want
to
i
have
fought
it
all
along
as
you
know
but
it
was
no
use
i
do
love
you
my
darling
and
i
love
you
you
do
know
how
i
love
you
it
is
like
suddenly
coming
out
into
sunshine
after
having
lived
in
a
cave
all
my
life
will
you
marry
me
but
she
drew
away
from
his
arms
at
that
alan
i
ca
marry
you
ever
i
can
only
love
you
why
not
you
must
tony
the
old
masterfulness
leaped
into
his
voice
i
can
not
alan
you
know
why
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
and
in
their
clear
depths
he
saw
reflected
his
own
willful
stained
undisciplined
past
he
bowed
his
head
in
real
shame
and
remorse
nothing
stood
between
himself
and
antoinette
holiday
but
himself
he
had
sown
the
wind
he
reaped
the
whirlwind
after
a
moment
he
looked
up
again
he
made
no
pretence
of
misunderstanding
her
meaning
you
could
forgive
he
pleaded
brokenly
gone
was
the
alan
massey
only
a
beggar
in
the
dust
remained
yes
alan
i
could
forgive
i
do
now
i
think
i
can
understand
how
such
things
can
be
in
a
man
life
though
it
would
break
my
heart
to
think
ted
or
larry
were
like
that
but
you
never
had
a
chance
nobody
ever
helped
you
to
keep
your
eyes
on
the
stars
they
are
there
now
he
groaned
you
are
my
star
tony
and
stars
are
very
very
far
away
from
the
like
of
me
he
echoed
carlotta
phrase
for
almost
the
first
time
in
his
life
humility
possessed
him
had
he
known
it
it
lifted
him
higher
in
tony
eyes
than
all
his
arrogance
and
conceit
of
power
had
ever
done
gently
she
slid
her
hand
into
his
i
do
feel
far
away
alan
i
feel
very
near
but
i
ca
marry
you
not
now
anyway
you
will
have
to
prove
to
them
all
to
me
too
that
you
are
a
man
a
holiday
might
be
proud
to
marry
i
could
forget
the
past
i
think
i
could
persuade
uncle
phil
and
the
rest
to
forget
it
too
they
are
none
of
them
puritans
they
could
understand
just
as
i
understand
that
a
man
might
fall
in
battle
and
carry
scars
of
defeat
but
not
be
really
conquered
alan
tell
me
something
it
easy
to
ask
but
i
must
are
the
things
i
have
to
forget
far
back
in
the
past
or
nearer
i
know
they
go
back
to
paris
days
the
days
miss
lottie
belongs
to
oh
yes
as
he
started
at
that
i
guessed
that
you
blame
her
she
was
merely
trying
to
warn
me
she
meant
it
for
my
good
not
to
be
spiteful
and
not
because
she
still
cares
though
i
think
she
does
and
i
know
there
are
things
that
belong
to
the
time
after
your
mother
died
and
you
did
care
what
you
did
because
you
were
so
unhappy
but
are
they
still
nearer
how
close
are
they
alan
he
shook
his
head
despairingly
i
wish
i
could
lie
to
you
tony
i
ca
they
are
too
close
to
be
pleasant
to
remember
but
they
never
will
be
again
i
swear
it
can
you
believe
it
i
shall
have
to
believe
it
be
convinced
of
it
before
i
could
marry
you
i
ca
marry
you
not
being
certain
of
you
just
because
my
heart
beats
fast
when
you
come
near
me
because
i
love
your
voice
and
your
kisses
and
would
rather
dance
with
you
than
to
be
sure
of
going
to
heaven
marriage
is
a
world
without
end
business
i
ca
rush
into
it
blindfold
i
wo
you
do
love
me
as
i
love
you
or
you
could
reason
so
coldly
about
it
he
reproached
you
would
go
blindfold
anywhere
to
hell
itself
even
with
me
i
do
know
alan
i
could
let
myself
go
while
we
were
dancing
in
there
i
am
afraid
i
would
have
been
willing
to
go
even
as
far
as
you
say
with
you
but
out
here
in
the
i
am
back
being
myself
i
want
to
make
my
life
into
something
clean
and
sweet
and
fine
i
do
want
to
let
myself
be
driven
to
follow
weak
selfish
rash
impulses
and
do
things
that
will
hurt
other
people
and
myself
i
do
want
to
make
my
people
sorry
they
are
dearer
than
any
happiness
of
my
own
they
would
not
let
me
marry
you
now
even
if
i
wished
it
if
i
did
what
you
want
and
what
maybe
something
in
me
wants
too
run
off
and
marry
you
tomorrow
without
their
consent
it
would
break
their
hearts
and
mine
afterward
when
i
had
waked
up
to
what
i
had
done
do
ask
me
dear
i
could
do
it
but
what
will
you
do
tony
wo
you
marry
me
ever
alan
tone
was
helpless
desolate
he
had
run
up
against
a
power
stronger
than
any
he
had
ever
wielded
a
force
which
left
him
baffled
i
do
know
it
will
depend
upon
you
a
year
from
now
if
you
still
want
me
and
i
am
still
free
if
you
can
come
to
me
and
tell
me
you
have
lived
for
twelve
months
as
a
man
who
loves
a
woman
ought
to
live
i
will
marry
you
if
i
love
you
enough
and
i
think
i
am
sure
i
shall
for
i
love
you
very
much
this
minute
a
year
tony
i
ca
wait
a
year
for
you
i
want
you
now
alan
tone
was
sharp
with
dismay
he
was
not
used
to
waiting
for
what
he
desired
he
had
taken
it
on
the
instant
as
a
rule
and
as
a
rule
his
takings
had
been
dust
and
ashes
as
soon
as
they
were
in
his
hands
you
can
not
have
me
alan
you
can
never
have
me
unless
you
earn
the
right
to
win
me
straight
understand
that
once
for
all
i
will
not
marry
a
weakling
i
will
marry
a
conquerer
perhaps
you
mean
that
tony
absolutely
then
by
god
i
be
a
conquerer
he
boasted
i
hope
you
will
oh
my
dear
my
dear
it
will
break
my
heart
if
you
fail
i
love
you
and
suddenly
tony
was
clinging
to
him
just
a
woman
who
cared
who
wanted
her
lover
even
as
he
wanted
her
but
in
a
breath
she
pulled
herself
away
take
me
in
alan
now
she
said
kiss
me
once
before
we
go
i
shall
not
see
you
in
the
morning
this
is
really
later
carlotta
coming
in
to
say
goodnight
to
tony
found
the
latter
sitting
in
front
of
the
mirror
brushing
out
her
abundant
hair
and
noticed
how
very
scarlet
her
friend
cheeks
were
and
what
a
shining
glory
there
was
in
her
eyes
it
was
a
lovely
party
announced
tony
casually
unaware
how
much
carlotta
had
seen
over
her
shoulder
in
the
mirror
tony
are
you
in
love
with
alan
massey
demanded
carlotta
tony
whirled
around
on
the
stool
her
cheeks
flying
deeper
crimson
banners
at
this
unexpected
challenge
i
am
afraid
i
am
carlotta
she
admitted
it
is
rather
a
mess
is
it
carlotta
groaned
and
dropping
into
a
chaise
lounge
encircled
her
knees
with
her
arms
staring
with
troubled
eyes
at
her
guest
a
mess
i
should
say
it
was
worse
than
a
mess
a
catastrophe
you
know
what
alan
is
is
she
floundered
off
into
silence
oh
yes
said
tony
the
more
tranquil
of
the
two
i
know
what
he
is
and
is
better
than
most
people
i
think
i
ought
to
but
i
love
him
i
just
discovered
it
or
rather
it
is
the
first
time
i
ever
let
myself
look
straight
at
the
fact
i
think
i
have
known
it
from
the
beginning
but
tony
you
wo
marry
him
you
ca
your
people
will
never
let
you
they
ought
to
let
you
tony
shook
back
her
wavy
mane
of
hair
sent
it
billowing
over
her
satin
kimono
it
do
matter
if
the
whole
world
wo
let
me
if
i
decide
to
marry
alan
i
shall
do
it
tony
there
was
shocked
consternation
in
carlotta
tone
and
tony
relenting
burst
into
a
low
tremulous
little
laugh
do
worry
carlotta
i
not
so
mad
as
i
sound
i
told
alan
he
would
have
to
wait
a
year
he
has
to
prove
to
me
he
is
worth
loving
but
you
are
engaged
carlotta
was
relieved
but
not
satisfied
tony
shook
her
head
absolutely
not
we
are
both
free
as
air
technically
if
you
were
in
love
yourself
you
would
know
how
much
that
amounts
to
by
way
of
freedom
carlotta
golden
head
was
bowed
she
did
not
answer
her
implication
that
she
could
not
be
expected
to
comprehend
the
delicate
invisible
omnipotent
shackles
of
love
do
tell
anyone
carlotta
please
it
is
our
secret
alan
and
mine
maybe
it
will
always
he
a
secret
unless
he
measures
up
you
are
not
going
to
tell
your
uncle
there
is
nothing
to
tell
yet
and
i
suppose
this
is
the
end
of
poor
dick
do
be
silly
carlotta
dick
never
said
a
word
of
love
to
me
in
his
life
that
does
mean
he
does
think
you
have
convenient
eyes
tony
darling
you
see
only
what
you
wish
to
see
i
did
want
to
see
alan
love
i
tried
dreadfully
hard
not
to
but
it
set
up
a
fire
in
my
own
house
and
blazed
and
smoked
until
i
had
to
do
something
about
it
see
here
carlotta
i
like
to
ask
you
a
question
or
two
you
are
not
really
going
to
marry
herbert
lathrop
are
you
a
queer
little
shadow
almost
like
a
veil
passed
over
carlotta
face
at
this
counter
charge
why
not
she
parried
you
know
why
not
he
is
exactly
what
hal
underwood
calls
him
a
poor
fish
he
is
as
close
to
being
a
nonentity
as
anything
i
ever
saw
precisely
why
i
selected
him
drawled
carlotta
i
got
to
marry
somebody
and
poor
herbert
has
a
vice
except
his
excess
of
virtue
we
ca
have
another
old
maid
in
the
family
aunt
lottie
is
a
shining
example
of
what
to
avoid
i
am
not
going
to
be
the
second
i
have
decided
on
that
as
if
you
could
protested
tony
indignantly
oh
i
could
you
look
at
aunt
lottie
pictures
of
fifteen
years
ago
she
was
just
as
pretty
as
i
am
she
had
loads
of
lovers
but
somehow
they
all
slipped
through
her
fingers
she
has
been
she
ought
to
have
married
and
had
children
i
do
want
to
be
a
hungry
spinster
they
are
infernally
miserable
carlotta
tony
was
a
little
shocked
at
her
friend
bluntness
a
little
puzzled
as
to
what
lay
behind
her
arguments
you
do
have
to
be
a
hungry
spinster
there
are
other
men
besides
herbert
that
want
to
marry
you
certainly
some
of
them
want
to
marry
my
money
some
of
them
want
to
marry
my
body
i
grant
you
herbert
is
a
poor
fish
in
some
ways
but
at
least
he
wants
to
marry
me
myself
which
is
more
than
the
others
do
that
is
true
hal
underwood
wants
to
marry
you
yourself
oh
hal
conceded
carlotta
i
forgot
him
for
a
moment
you
are
right
he
is
real
too
real
i
should
hurt
him
marrying
him
and
not
caring
enough
that
is
why
a
nonentity
is
preferable
it
does
know
what
it
is
missing
hal
would
know
but
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
wait
until
you
find
somebody
you
could
care
for
persisted
tony
that
is
all
you
know
about
it
my
dear
there
is
the
best
reason
in
the
world
i
found
him
and
lost
him
carlotta
is
it
phil
carlotta
sprang
up
and
went
over
to
the
window
she
took
the
rose
she
had
been
wearing
in
her
hands
and
deliberately
pulled
it
apart
letting
the
petals
drift
one
by
one
out
into
the
night
then
she
turned
back
to
tony
do
ask
questions
tony
i
am
not
going
to
talk
but
she
lingered
a
moment
beside
her
friend
you
and
i
tony
darling
do
seem
to
have
very
much
luck
in
love
she
murmured
i
hope
you
will
be
happy
with
alan
if
you
do
marry
him
but
happiness
is
exactly
necessary
there
are
other
things
she
broke
off
and
began
again
there
are
other
things
in
a
man
life
besides
love
somebody
said
that
to
me
once
and
i
believe
it
is
true
but
there
is
so
much
besides
that
matters
much
to
a
woman
i
wish
there
were
i
hate
love
and
pressing
a
rare
kiss
on
her
friend
cheek
carlotta
vanished
for
the
night
meanwhile
alan
massey
smoked
and
thought
and
cursed
the
past
that
had
him
in
its
hateful
toils
like
the
guilty
king
in
hamlet
his
soul
struggling
to
be
free
was
but
the
more
engaged
he
honestly
desired
to
be
worthy
of
tony
holiday
to
stand
clear
in
her
eyes
but
he
did
not
want
it
badly
enough
to
the
teeth
and
forehead
of
his
faults
to
give
in
evidence
he
did
not
want
to
bare
the
one
worst
plague
spot
of
all
and
run
the
risk
not
only
of
losing
tony
himself
but
perhaps
also
of
clearing
the
way
to
her
for
his
cousin
john
massey
small
wonder
he
smoked
gall
and
wormwood
in
his
cigarettes
that
night
and
far
away
in
the
heat
and
grime
and
din
of
the
great
city
dick
carson
the
nameless
who
was
really
john
massey
and
heir
to
a
great
fortune
sat
dreaming
over
a
girl
picture
telling
himself
that
tony
must
care
a
little
to
have
gotten
up
in
the
silver
gray
of
the
morning
to
see
him
off
so
kindly
happily
for
the
dreamer
peace
of
mind
he
had
no
means
of
knowing
that
that
very
night
in
the
starlit
garden
by
the
sea
tony
holiday
had
taken
upon
herself
the
mad
and
sad
and
glad
bondage
of
love
chapter
xv
on
the
edge
of
the
precipice
tony
getting
off
the
train
at
dunbury
on
saturday
found
her
brothers
waiting
for
her
with
the
car
and
the
kiddies
on
the
back
seat
for
ballast
as
ted
said
with
one
quick
apprizing
glance
the
girl
took
in
the
two
young
men
ted
was
brown
and
healthy
looking
for
once
without
the
inevitable
cigarette
in
his
mouth
he
was
oddly
improved
somehow
his
sister
thought
considering
how
short
a
time
she
had
been
away
from
the
hill
she
noticed
also
that
he
drove
the
car
much
less
recklessly
than
was
his
wont
took
no
chances
on
curves
slid
by
no
vehicles
at
space
speeded
not
at
all
and
though
he
kept
up
a
running
fire
of
merry
nonsense
had
his
eye
on
the
road
as
he
drove
so
far
so
good
that
spill
out
on
the
florence
road
was
all
loss
it
seemed
larry
was
more
baffling
he
was
always
quiet
he
was
quieter
than
ever
there
was
something
in
his
gray
eyes
which
spelled
trouble
tony
thought
what
was
it
was
he
worried
about
a
case
was
granny
worse
was
ted
in
some
scrape
something
there
certainly
was
on
his
mind
tony
was
sure
of
that
though
she
could
not
conjecture
what
the
holidays
had
an
almost
uncanny
way
of
understanding
things
about
each
other
things
which
sometimes
never
rose
to
the
surface
at
all
perhaps
it
was
that
they
were
so
close
together
in
sympathy
that
a
kind
of
small
telepathic
signal
registered
automatically
when
anything
was
wrong
with
any
of
them
so
far
as
her
brothers
were
concerned
tony
intuition
was
all
but
infallible
she
found
the
family
gift
a
shade
disconcerting
a
little
later
when
after
her
uncle
kissed
her
he
held
her
off
at
arm
length
and
studied
her
face
tony
eyes
fell
beneath
his
questioning
gaze
for
almost
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
a
secret
to
keep
from
him
if
she
could
what
have
they
been
doing
to
my
little
girl
he
asked
they
have
taken
away
her
sunshininess
oh
no
they
have
denied
tony
quickly
it
is
just
that
i
am
tired
we
have
been
on
the
go
all
the
time
and
kept
scandalously
late
hours
i
be
all
right
as
soon
as
i
have
caught
up
i
feel
as
if
i
could
sleep
for
a
century
and
any
prince
who
has
the
effrontery
to
wake
me
up
will
fare
badly
she
laughed
but
even
in
her
own
ears
the
laughter
did
not
sound
quite
natural
and
she
was
sure
uncle
phil
thought
the
same
though
he
asked
no
more
questions
it
is
like
living
in
a
palace
being
at
crest
house
she
went
on
played
princess
to
my
heart
content
been
waited
on
and
fêted
and
flirted
with
until
i
tired
to
death
of
it
all
and
want
to
be
just
plain
tony
again
she
slid
into
her
uncle
arms
with
a
weary
little
sigh
it
was
good
oh
so
good
to
have
him
again
she
had
known
she
had
missed
him
so
until
she
felt
the
comfort
of
his
presence
in
his
arms
alan
massey
and
all
he
stood
for
seemed
very
far
away
got
letters
for
you
this
morning
announced
ted
i
forgot
to
give
them
to
you
he
fished
the
aforesaid
letters
out
of
his
pocket
and
examined
them
before
handing
them
over
one
is
from
dick
the
other
he
held
the
large
square
envelope
off
and
squinted
at
it
teasingly
some
scrawl
he
commented
reckless
display
of
ink
and
flourishes
i
call
it
the
party
tony
snatched
the
letters
her
face
rosy
give
me
dick
i
have
heard
from
him
but
once
since
he
went
back
to
new
york
and
that
was
just
a
card
listen
everybody
the
universal
has
accepted
his
story
and
wants
him
to
do
a
whole
series
of
them
oh
is
that
just
wonderful
tony
old
sparkles
were
back
now
there
were
no
reservations
necessary
here
everybody
knew
and
loved
dick
and
would
be
glad
as
she
was
herself
in
his
success
hail
to
dicky
dumas
she
added
gaily
waving
the
letter
aloft
i
always
knew
he
would
get
there
and
that
was
the
very
story
he
read
me
was
it
lucky
i
liked
it
really
if
i
had
and
it
had
turned
out
to
be
good
would
it
have
been
awful
everybody
laughed
at
that
and
perhaps
nobody
but
the
doctor
noticed
that
the
other
letter
in
the
unfamiliar
handwriting
was
tucked
away
very
quickly
out
of
sight
in
her
bag
and
no
comments
made
it
was
not
until
tony
had
gone
the
rounds
of
the
household
and
greeted
everyone
from
granny
down
to
max
that
she
read
alan
letter
as
she
sat
curled
up
in
the
cretonned
window
seat
just
as
the
little
girl
tony
had
been
wont
to
sit
and
devour
love
stories
this
was
a
love
story
too
her
own
and
with
a
sadly
complicated
plot
at
that
it
was
the
first
letter
she
had
had
from
alan
and
she
found
it
very
wonderful
and
exciting
reading
it
was
brimming
over
as
might
have
been
expected
with
passionate
lover
protests
and
extravagant
endearments
which
tony
could
not
have
imagined
her
relatives
or
friends
even
conceiving
let
alone
putting
on
paper
but
alan
was
different
these
things
were
no
affectation
with
him
but
natural
as
breathing
part
and
parcel
of
his
personality
she
could
hear
him
now
say
in
that
low
musical
voice
of
his
and
the
word
seemed
very
sweet
and
beautiful
to
her
as
it
sang
in
her
heart
and
she
read
it
in
the
dashing
script
upon
the
paper
he
was
desolated
without
her
he
wrote
nothing
was
worth
while
nothing
interested
him
he
was
refusing
all
invitations
went
nowhere
he
just
sat
alone
in
the
studio
and
dreamed
about
her
or
made
sketches
of
her
from
memory
she
was
everywhere
all
about
him
she
filled
the
studio
with
her
voice
her
laughter
her
wonderful
eyes
but
oh
he
was
so
lonely
so
unutterably
lonely
without
her
must
he
really
wait
a
whole
year
before
he
made
her
his
a
year
was
twelve
long
long
months
anything
could
happen
in
a
year
one
of
them
might
die
and
the
other
would
go
frustrate
and
lonely
forever
like
a
sad
wind
in
the
night
tony
caught
her
breath
quickly
at
that
sentence
the
poetry
of
it
captivated
her
fancy
the
dread
of
what
it
conjured
clutched
like
cold
hands
at
her
heart
she
wanted
alan
now
wanted
love
now
already
those
dear
folks
downstairs
were
beginning
to
seem
like
ghosts
she
and
alan
the
only
real
people
what
if
he
should
die
what
if
something
should
happen
to
keep
them
forever
apart
how
could
she
bear
it
how
could
she
she
turned
back
to
her
letter
which
had
turned
into
an
impassioned
plea
that
she
would
never
forsake
him
no
matter
what
happened
never
drive
him
over
the
precipice
like
the
gadderene
swine
you
and
your
love
are
the
only
thing
that
can
save
me
dear
heart
he
wrote
remember
that
always
without
you
i
shall
go
down
down
into
blacker
pits
than
i
ever
sank
before
with
you
i
shall
come
out
into
the
light
i
swear
it
but
oh
beloved
pray
for
me
if
you
know
how
to
pray
i
do
i
never
had
a
god
there
were
tears
in
tony
eyes
as
she
finished
her
lover
letter
his
unwonted
humility
touched
her
as
no
arrogance
could
ever
have
done
his
appeal
to
his
desperate
need
moved
her
profoundly
as
such
appeals
will
always
move
woman
it
is
an
old
tale
and
one
oft
repeated
man
crying
out
at
a
woman
feet
save
me
save
me
myself
i
can
not
save
woman
believing
because
she
longs
to
believe
it
that
salvation
lies
in
her
power
taking
on
herself
the
all
but
impossible
mission
for
love
high
sake
tony
holiday
believed
as
all
the
million
other
women
have
believed
since
time
began
that
she
could
save
her
lover
loved
him
tenfold
the
more
because
he
threw
himself
upon
her
mercy
came
indeed
perhaps
to
truly
love
him
for
the
first
time
now
with
a
kind
of
consecrated
fervor
which
belonged
all
to
the
spirit
even
as
the
love
that
had
come
to
her
while
they
danced
had
belonged
rather
to
the
flesh
and
day
by
day
jim
roberts
grew
sicker
and
the
gnawing
thing
crept
up
nearer
to
his
heart
day
by
day
he
gloated
over
the
goading
whips
he
brandished
over
alan
massey
head
amused
himself
with
the
various
developments
it
lay
in
his
power
to
give
to
the
situation
as
he
passed
out
of
life
he
wrote
two
letters
from
his
sick
bed
the
first
one
was
addressed
to
dick
carson
telling
the
full
story
of
his
own
and
alan
massey
share
in
the
deliberate
defraudment
of
that
young
man
of
his
rightful
name
and
estate
it
pleased
him
to
read
and
reread
this
letter
and
to
reflect
that
when
it
was
mailed
alan
massey
would
drink
the
full
cup
of
disgrace
and
exposure
while
he
who
was
infinitely
guiltier
would
be
sleeping
very
quietly
in
a
cool
grave
where
hate
nor
vengeance
nor
even
pity
could
touch
him
the
other
letter
which
like
the
first
he
kept
unmailed
was
a
less
honest
and
less
incriminating
letter
filled
with
plausible
half
truths
telling
how
he
had
just
become
aware
at
last
through
coming
into
possession
of
some
old
letters
of
the
identity
of
the
boy
he
had
once
had
in
his
keeping
and
who
had
run
away
from
him
an
identity
which
he
now
hastened
to
reveal
in
the
interests
of
tardy
justice
the
letter
made
no
mention
of
alan
massey
nor
of
the
unlovely
bargain
he
had
driven
with
that
young
man
as
the
price
of
silence
and
the
bliss
of
ignorance
it
was
addressed
to
the
lawyers
who
handled
the
massey
estate
roberts
had
followed
up
various
trails
and
discovered
that
antoinette
holiday
was
the
girl
massey
loved
discovered
through
the
bribing
of
a
crest
house
servant
that
the
young
man
they
called
carson
was
also
presumably
in
love
with
the
girl
whose
family
had
befriended
him
so
generously
in
his
need
it
was
incredibly
good
he
thought
he
could
hardly
have
thought
out
a
more
diabolically
clever
plot
if
he
had
tried
he
could
make
alan
massey
writhe
trebly
knowing
these
things
pursuing
his
malignant
whim
he
wrote
to
alan
massey
and
told
him
of
the
existence
of
the
two
letters
as
yet
unmailed
in
his
table
drawer
he
made
it
clear
that
one
of
the
letters
damned
alan
massey
utterly
while
the
other
only
robbed
him
of
his
fortune
made
it
clear
also
that
he
himself
did
not
know
which
of
the
two
would
be
mailed
in
the
end
possibly
he
would
decide
it
by
a
flip
of
a
coin
massey
could
only
wait
and
see
what
happened
i
suppose
you
think
the
girl
is
worth
going
to
hell
for
even
if
the
money
is
he
had
written
maybe
she
is
some
women
are
perhaps
but
do
forget
that
if
she
loves
you
you
will
be
dragging
her
down
there
too
pretty
thought
is
it
i
do
mean
any
business
either
that
rot
i
heard
enough
of
that
when
i
was
a
boy
to
sicken
me
of
it
forever
it
is
the
here
and
now
hell
a
man
pays
for
his
sins
with
and
that
is
god
truth
alan
massey
and
alan
sitting
in
his
luxurious
studio
reading
the
letter
crushed
it
in
his
hands
and
groaned
aloud
he
needed
no
commentary
on
the
here
and
now
hell
from
jim
roberts
he
was
living
it
those
summer
days
if
ever
a
man
did
it
was
the
money
now
alan
told
himself
he
no
longer
cared
for
that
hated
it
in
fact
it
was
tony
now
all
tony
and
the
horrible
fear
lest
roberts
betray
him
and
shut
the
gates
of
paradise
upon
him
forever
sometimes
in
his
agony
of
fear
he
could
almost
have
been
glad
to
end
it
all
with
one
shot
of
the
automatic
he
kept
always
near
to
beat
jim
roberts
to
the
bliss
of
oblivion
in
the
easiest
way
but
alan
massey
had
an
incorrigible
belief
in
his
luck
just
as
he
had
hoped
until
he
had
all
but
believed
that
his
cousin
john
was
as
dead
as
he
had
told
that
very
person
he
was
so
now
he
hoped
against
all
reason
that
he
would
be
saved
at
the
eleventh
hour
that
roberts
would
go
to
his
death
carrying
with
him
the
secret
that
would
destroy
himself
if
it
ceased
to
be
a
secret
those
unmailed
letters
haunted
him
however
day
and
night
so
much
so
in
fact
that
he
took
a
journey
to
boston
one
day
and
sought
out
the
little
cigar
store
again
but
this
time
he
had
not
mounted
the
stairs
his
business
was
with
the
boy
with
one
fifty
dollar
bill
he
bought
the
lad
promise
to
destroy
the
letters
and
the
packet
in
robert
drawer
in
the
event
of
the
latter
death
secured
also
the
promise
that
if
at
any
time
before
his
death
roberts
gave
orders
that
either
letter
should
be
mailed
the
boy
would
send
the
same
not
to
the
address
on
the
envelope
but
to
alan
massey
if
the
boy
kept
faith
with
his
pledges
there
would
be
another
fifty
coming
to
him
after
the
death
of
the
man
he
bought
the
lad
even
as
roberts
had
once
bought
himself
it
was
a
sickening
transaction
but
it
relieved
his
mind
considerably
and
catered
in
a
measure
to
that
incorrigible
hope
within
him
but
he
paid
a
price
too
fifty
miles
away
from
boston
was
tony
holiday
on
her
heaven
kissing
hill
he
was
mad
to
go
to
her
but
dared
not
lest
this
fresh
corruption
in
some
way
betray
itself
to
her
clear
gaze
so
he
went
back
to
new
york
without
seeing
her
and
tony
never
knew
he
had
been
so
near
and
that
night
jim
roberts
took
an
unexpected
turn
for
the
worse
and
died
foiled
of
that
last
highly
anticipated
spice
of
malice
in
flipping
the
coin
that
was
to
decide
alan
massey
fate
in
the
end
the
boy
had
not
had
the
courage
to
destroy
the
letters
as
he
had
promised
to
do
instead
he
sent
them
both
together
with
the
packet
of
evidence
as
to
john
massey
identity
to
alan
massey
the
thing
was
in
alan
own
hands
at
last
nothing
could
save
or
destroy
him
but
himself
and
by
a
paradox
his
salvation
depended
upon
his
being
strong
enough
to
bring
himself
to
ruin
chapter
xvi
in
which
phil
gets
his
eyes
opened
at
home
on
her
hill
tony
holiday
settled
down
more
or
less
happily
after
her
eventful
sally
into
the
great
world
to
the
careless
observer
she
was
quite
the
same
tony
who
went
down
the
hill
a
few
weeks
earlier
if
at
times
she
was
unusually
quiet
had
spells
of
sitting
very
still
with
folded
hands
and
far
away
dreams
in
her
eyes
if
she
crept
away
by
herself
to
read
the
long
letters
that
came
so
often
from
many
addresses
but
always
in
the
same
bold
beautiful
script
and
to
pen
long
answers
to
these
if
she
read
more
poetry
than
was
her
wont
and
sang
love
songs
with
a
new
exquisite
but
rather
heart
breaking
timbre
in
her
lovely
contralto
voice
no
one
paid
much
attention
to
these
signs
except
possibly
doctor
philip
who
saw
most
things
he
perceived
regretfully
that
his
little
girl
was
slipping
away
from
him
passing
through
some
experience
that
was
by
no
means
all
joy
or
contentment
and
which
was
making
her
grow
up
all
too
fast
but
he
said
nothing
quietly
bided
the
hour
of
confidence
which
he
felt
sure
would
come
sooner
or
later
tony
puzzled
much
over
the
complexities
of
life
these
days
puzzled
over
other
things
beside
her
own
perverse
romance
carlotta
too
was
much
on
her
mind
she
wished
she
could
wave
a
magic
wand
and
make
things
come
right
for
these
two
friends
of
hers
who
were
evidently
made
for
each
other
as
hal
had
propounded
she
wondered
if
phil
were
as
unhappy
as
carlotta
was
and
meant
to
find
out
in
her
own
time
and
way
she
had
seen
almost
nothing
of
him
since
her
return
to
the
hill
he
was
working
very
hard
in
the
store
and
never
appeared
at
any
of
the
little
dances
and
picnics
and
teas
with
which
the
dunbury
younger
set
passed
away
the
summer
days
and
nights
and
which
ted
and
the
twins
and
usually
tony
herself
frequented
larry
never
did
he
hated
things
of
that
sort
but
phil
was
different
he
had
always
liked
fun
and
parties
and
had
always
been
on
hand
and
in
great
demand
hitherto
at
every
social
function
from
a
ladies
aid
strawberry
festival
to
a
grand
masonic
ball
it
natural
for
phil
to
shut
himself
out
of
things
like
that
it
was
a
bad
sign
tony
thought
at
any
rate
she
determined
to
find
out
for
herself
how
the
land
lay
if
she
could
having
occasion
to
do
some
shopping
she
marched
down
the
hill
and
presented
herself
at
stuart
lambert
and
son
demanding
to
be
served
by
no
less
a
person
than
philip
himself
i
want
a
pair
of
black
satin
pumps
with
very
frivolous
heels
she
announced
produce
them
this
instant
slave
she
smiled
at
phil
and
he
smiled
back
he
and
tony
had
always
been
the
best
of
chums
cannzy
ones
he
laughed
that
what
one
of
our
customers
calls
them
and
while
he
knelt
before
her
with
an
array
of
shoe
boxes
around
him
fitting
a
dainty
slipper
on
tony
pretty
foot
tony
herself
looked
not
at
the
slipper
but
at
philip
studying
his
face
shrewdly
he
looked
older
graver
there
was
less
laughter
in
his
blue
eyes
a
grimmer
line
about
his
young
mouth
poor
phil
evidently
carlotta
was
the
only
one
who
was
paying
the
price
of
too
much
loving
tony
made
up
her
mind
to
rush
in
though
she
knew
it
might
be
a
case
for
angel
hesitation
i
never
given
you
a
message
hal
underwood
sent
you
she
observed
irrelevantly
philip
looked
up
surprised
hal
underwood
what
message
did
he
send
me
i
hardly
know
him
he
seemed
to
know
you
rather
well
he
told
me
to
tell
you
to
come
down
and
marry
carlotta
that
you
were
the
only
man
that
could
keep
her
in
order
that
is
too
big
phil
try
a
smaller
one
the
speaker
kicked
off
the
offending
slipper
philip
mechanically
picked
it
up
and
replaced
it
in
the
box
that
is
rather
a
queer
message
he
commented
i
had
an
idea
underwood
wanted
to
marry
carlotta
himself
try
this
he
reached
for
another
pump
his
eyes
were
lowered
so
tony
could
not
see
them
she
wished
she
could
he
does
she
said
she
wo
have
him
is
is
there
anybody
she
is
likely
to
have
the
words
jerked
out
as
the
young
man
groped
for
the
shoe
horn
which
was
almost
beside
his
hand
but
which
apparently
he
did
not
see
at
all
i
am
afraid
she
is
likely
to
take
herbert
lathrop
unless
somebody
stops
her
by
main
force
why
do
you
play
lochinvar
yourself
phil
you
could
philip
looked
straight
up
at
tony
then
the
slipper
forgotten
in
his
hand
tony
do
you
mean
that
he
asked
i
certainly
do
make
her
marry
you
phil
it
is
the
only
way
with
carlotta
i
do
want
to
any
girl
marry
me
he
said
oh
hang
your
silly
pride
phil
lambert
carlotta
wants
to
marry
you
i
tell
you
though
she
would
murder
me
if
she
knew
i
did
tell
you
maybe
she
does
but
she
does
want
to
live
in
dunbury
i
good
reason
to
know
that
we
thrashed
it
out
rather
thoroughly
on
the
top
of
mount
tom
last
june
she
has
changed
her
mind
tony
sighed
she
was
afraid
phil
was
right
carlotta
had
changed
her
mind
was
it
because
she
was
afraid
she
might
that
she
was
determining
to
marry
herbert
and
you
ca
leave
dunbury
she
asked
soberly
just
at
that
moment
stuart
lambert
approached
a
tall
fine
looking
man
with
the
same
blue
eyes
and
fresh
coloring
as
his
son
and
brown
hair
only
slightly
graying
around
the
temples
he
had
an
air
of
vigor
and
ageless
youth
indeed
a
stranger
might
easily
have
taken
the
two
men
for
brothers
instead
of
father
and
son
hello
tony
my
dear
he
greeted
cordially
it
is
good
to
see
you
round
again
we
have
missed
you
this
boy
of
mine
getting
you
what
you
want
he
is
trying
smiled
tony
a
woman
does
always
know
what
she
wants
lambert
the
store
is
wonderful
since
it
was
enlarged
and
i
see
lots
of
other
improvements
too
her
eyes
swept
her
surroundings
with
sincere
appreciation
make
your
bow
to
phil
for
all
that
it
is
good
to
get
fresh
brains
into
a
business
we
old
fogies
need
jerking
out
of
our
ruts
the
older
man
eyes
fell
upon
phil
bowed
head
and
tony
realized
how
much
it
meant
to
him
to
have
his
son
with
him
at
last
pulling
shoulder
to
shoulder
new
brains
nothing
protested
phil
dad
got
me
skinned
going
and
coming
for
progressiveness
as
for
old
fogies
he
the
youngest
man
i
know
make
all
your
bows
to
him
tony
it
is
where
they
belong
and
phil
got
to
his
feet
and
himself
made
a
solemn
obeisance
in
stuart
direction
lambert
chuckled
phil
was
always
a
blarney
he
said
do
know
where
he
got
it
do
you
believe
a
word
he
says
my
dear
but
tony
saw
he
was
immensely
pleased
with
phil
tribute
for
all
that
how
do
you
like
the
sign
he
asked
fine
looks
good
to
me
and
i
know
it
does
to
you
mr
lambert
well
rather
the
speaker
rested
his
hand
on
phil
shoulder
a
moment
i
tell
you
it
good
young
lady
to
have
the
son
part
added
worth
waiting
for
i
mighty
proud
of
that
sign
between
you
and
me
miss
tony
i
proud
of
my
son
too
who
is
blarneying
now
laughed
phil
go
on
with
you
dad
you
are
spoiling
my
sale
the
father
chuckled
again
and
moved
away
phil
looked
down
at
the
girl
i
think
your
question
is
answered
i
ca
leave
dunbury
he
said
then
carlotta
ought
to
come
to
you
there
are
no
oughts
in
carlotta
bright
lexicon
i
do
blame
her
tony
dunbury
is
a
dead
hole
from
most
points
of
view
i
am
afraid
she
would
be
happy
here
you
would
be
yourself
forever
bet
you
are
planning
to
get
away
right
now
tony
nodded
ruefully
i
suppose
i
am
phil
the
modern
young
woman
is
much
to
pin
faith
to
i
am
afraid
do
i
get
another
slipper
or
is
one
enough
phil
came
back
from
his
mental
aberration
with
a
start
and
a
grin
at
his
own
expense
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
a
very
good
salesman
today
he
apologized
honestly
i
do
better
usually
but
you
hit
me
in
a
vulnerable
spot
you
do
care
for
carlotta
then
probed
tony
care
i
crazy
over
her
i
go
on
my
hands
and
knees
to
crest
house
if
i
thought
i
could
get
her
to
marry
me
by
doing
it
you
would
much
better
go
by
train
the
next
one
that
my
advice
are
you
coming
to
sue
emerson
dance
that
is
why
i
am
buying
slippers
you
can
dance
with
if
you
come
sorry
i
do
go
to
dances
any
more
that
is
nonsense
phil
it
is
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
for
you
to
make
a
hermit
of
yourself
no
girl
worth
it
besides
there
are
other
girls
besides
carlotta
phil
shook
his
head
as
he
finished
replacing
tony
trim
brown
oxfords
unfortunately
that
is
true
for
me
he
said
rising
at
present
my
world
consists
of
myself
bounded
north
south
east
and
west
by
carlotta
and
tony
passing
out
under
the
sign
of
stuart
lambert
and
son
a
few
minutes
later
sighed
a
little
here
was
carlotta
with
a
real
man
for
the
taking
and
too
stubborn
and
foolish
to
put
out
her
hand
and
here
was
herself
tony
holiday
tying
herself
all
up
in
a
strange
snarl
for
the
sake
of
somebody
who
was
a
man
at
all
as
holiday
hill
standards
ran
what
queer
creatures
women
were
other
people
besides
tony
were
inclined
to
score
phil
folly
in
making
a
hermit
of
himself
his
sisters
attacked
him
that
very
night
on
the
subject
of
sue
emerson
dance
and
accused
him
of
being
a
grumpy
grandpa
and
a
grouch
and
various
other
uncomplimentary
things
when
he
announced
that
he
was
going
to
attend
the
function
i
the
authentic
he
parried
from
his
perch
on
the
porch
railing
i
cut
out
dancing
more
idiot
you
retorted
charley
promptly
mums
do
tell
phil
it
is
all
nonsense
making
such
an
oyster
in
a
shell
of
himself
lambert
smiled
and
looked
up
at
her
tall
young
son
looked
rather
hard
for
a
moment
i
think
the
twins
are
right
phil
she
said
you
are
working
too
hard
you
do
allow
yourself
any
relaxation
oh
yes
i
do
only
my
idea
of
relaxation
does
happen
to
coincide
with
the
twins
dancing
in
this
sort
of
weather
with
your
collar
slumping
and
the
perspiration
rolling
in
tidal
waves
down
your
manly
brow
strike
me
as
being
a
particularly
desirable
diversion
sniffed
charley
you
did
object
to
dancing
last
summer
when
it
was
twice
as
hot
you
went
to
a
dance
almost
every
night
when
carlotta
was
visiting
tony
you
know
you
did
i
was
a
member
of
the
esteemed
firm
of
stuart
lambert
and
son
last
summer
a
lily
of
the
field
can
afford
to
dance
all
night
i
a
working
man
i
have
you
know
well
i
think
you
might
come
just
this
once
to
please
us
joined
in
clare
the
other
twin
you
are
a
gorgeous
dancer
phil
i
rather
have
a
one
step
with
you
than
any
man
i
know
clare
always
beguiled
where
charley
bullied
a
method
much
more
successful
in
the
long
run
as
charley
sometimes
grudgingly
admitted
after
the
fact
phil
smiled
now
at
pretty
clare
and
promised
to
think
about
it
and
the
twins
flew
off
across
the
street
to
visit
with
tony
and
ruth
whom
the
whole
hill
adored
phil
dear
are
you
happy
asked
lambert
have
we
asked
too
much
of
you
expecting
you
to
settle
down
at
home
with
us
why
yes
mums
i
all
right
phil
left
his
post
on
the
rail
and
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
his
mother
perhaps
he
did
it
purposely
lest
she
see
too
much
do
get
notions
in
your
head
i
like
living
in
dunbury
i
would
live
in
a
city
for
anything
and
i
like
being
with
dad
not
to
mention
the
rest
of
you
lambert
shifted
her
position
also
she
wanted
to
see
her
son
face
just
as
much
as
he
did
want
her
to
see
it
possibly
that
is
all
so
but
you
are
happy
for
all
that
you
fool
mother
eyes
my
dear
phil
looked
straight
at
her
then
with
a
little
rueful
smile
i
reckon
i
ca
he
admitted
very
well
then
i
am
not
entirely
happy
but
it
is
nobody
fault
and
nothing
anybody
can
help
philip
is
it
a
girl
how
they
dread
the
in
their
sons
lives
these
mothers
the
very
possibility
of
her
in
the
abstract
brings
a
shadow
across
the
path
yes
mums
it
is
a
girl
lambert
rose
and
went
over
to
where
her
son
sat
running
her
fingers
through
his
hair
as
she
had
been
wont
to
do
when
the
little
boy
phil
was
in
trouble
of
any
sort
i
am
very
sorry
dear
boy
she
said
it
wo
help
to
talk
about
it
i
am
afraid
not
do
worry
mums
it
is
just
well
it
hurts
a
little
just
now
that
all
she
kissed
his
forehead
and
went
back
to
her
chair
it
hurt
her
to
know
her
boy
was
being
hurt
hurt
her
almost
as
much
to
know
she
could
not
help
him
she
must
just
let
him
close
the
door
on
his
grief
and
bear
it
alone
yet
she
respected
his
reserve
and
loved
him
the
better
for
it
phil
was
like
that
always
he
never
cried
out
when
he
was
hurt
she
remembered
how
long
ago
the
little
boy
phil
had
come
to
her
with
a
small
finger
just
released
from
a
slamming
door
that
had
crushed
it
unmercifully
the
tears
streaming
down
his
cheeks
but
uttering
no
sound
she
recalled
another
incident
of
years
later
when
the
coach
had
been
obliged
to
put
some
one
else
in
phil
place
on
the
team
the
last
minute
because
his
sprained
ankle
had
been
bothering
she
and
stuart
had
come
on
for
the
game
it
had
been
a
bitter
disappointment
to
them
all
to
the
boy
it
had
been
little
short
of
a
tragedy
but
he
had
smiled
bravely
at
her
in
spite
of
the
trouble
in
his
blue
eyes
do
mind
mums
it
is
all
right
he
had
said
steadily
we
got
to
win
we
ca
risk
my
darned
flopping
it
the
bleachers
for
me
the
game
the
thing
the
game
had
always
been
the
thing
for
phil
even
in
his
blundering
willful
boyhood
he
had
played
hard
and
played
fair
and
taken
defeat
like
a
man
when
things
had
gone
against
him
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
lambert
spoke
again
phil
i
wish
you
would
go
to
the
dance
with
the
girls
it
will
please
them
and
be
good
for
you
you
ca
shut
yourself
away
from
everything
the
way
you
are
doing
if
you
are
going
to
make
dunbury
your
home
your
father
never
has
he
has
always
given
himself
freely
to
it
worked
with
it
played
with
it
made
it
a
real
part
of
himself
you
must
start
out
by
building
a
wall
around
yourself
am
i
doing
that
mums
phil
voice
was
sober
i
am
afraid
you
are
phil
it
troubles
your
father
he
was
so
disappointed
when
you
would
serve
on
the
library
committee
they
were
disappointed
too
they
did
expect
it
of
your
father
son
i
i
was
interested
no
you
were
interested
that
was
the
trouble
you
ought
to
have
been
you
have
had
your
college
training
the
world
of
books
has
been
thrown
wide
open
for
you
you
come
back
here
and
are
interested
in
seeing
that
others
less
fortunate
get
the
right
kind
of
books
into
their
hands
and
heads
i
do
want
to
preach
dear
but
education
is
only
a
privilege
it
is
a
responsibility
maybe
you
are
right
mums
i
did
think
of
it
that
way
i
just
did
want
to
bother
i
was
well
i
was
thinking
too
much
about
myself
i
suppose
youth
is
apt
to
there
were
other
things
too
when
they
asked
you
to
take
charge
of
the
fourth
of
july
pageant
to
dig
up
dunbury
past
history
and
make
it
live
for
us
again
your
father
and
i
both
thought
you
would
enjoy
it
he
was
tremendously
excited
about
it
full
of
ideas
to
help
but
the
project
fell
through
because
nobody
would
undertake
the
leadership
you
were
too
busy
every
one
was
too
busy
but
mums
i
was
busy
phil
defended
himself
it
is
no
end
of
a
job
to
put
things
like
that
through
properly
most
things
worth
doing
are
no
end
of
a
job
your
father
would
have
taken
it
with
all
the
rest
he
has
on
his
hands
and
made
a
success
of
it
but
he
was
hurt
by
your
high
handed
refusal
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
and
he
let
it
go
though
you
know
having
fourth
of
july
community
celebrations
is
one
of
his
dearest
hobbies
always
has
been
since
he
used
to
fight
so
hard
to
get
rid
of
the
old
wretched
noise
law
breaking
and
rowdyism
kind
of
village
celebration
you
and
the
other
young
dunbury
vandals
delighted
in
phil
flushed
at
that
the
point
went
home
he
remembered
vividly
his
boyish
self
tearing
reluctantly
from
doctor
holiday
fireworks
impelled
by
an
unbearably
guilty
conscience
to
confess
to
stuart
lambert
that
his
own
son
had
been
a
transgressor
against
the
law
boy
as
he
was
he
had
gotten
out
of
the
interview
with
his
father
that
night
a
glimpse
into
the
ideal
citizenship
which
stuart
lambert
preached
and
lived
and
worked
for
he
had
understood
a
little
then
he
understood
better
now
having
stood
beside
his
father
man
to
man
i
am
sorry
mums
i
would
have
done
the
thing
if
i
known
dad
wanted
me
to
why
did
he
say
so
lambert
smiled
dad
does
say
much
about
what
he
wants
you
will
have
to
learn
to
keep
your
eyes
open
and
find
out
for
yourself
i
did
any
more
black
marks
on
my
score
i
may
as
well
eat
the
whole
darned
pie
at
once
phil
smile
was
humorous
but
his
eyes
were
troubled
it
was
a
bit
hard
when
you
had
been
thinking
you
had
played
your
part
fairly
creditably
to
discover
you
had
been
fumbling
your
cues
wretchedly
all
along
only
one
other
thing
we
were
both
immensely
disappointed
when
you
would
take
the
they
offered
you
father
believes
tremendously
in
the
movement
he
thinks
it
is
going
to
be
the
making
of
the
next
generation
of
men
he
would
have
liked
you
to
be
a
scoutmaster
and
when
you
would
he
went
on
the
scout
troop
committee
himself
though
he
really
could
not
spare
the
time
i
see
said
phil
i
guess
i
been
pretty
blind
funny
part
of
it
is
i
really
wanted
to
take
the
scoutmaster
job
but
i
thought
dad
would
think
it
took
too
much
of
my
time
anything
more
he
asked
not
a
thing
have
you
had
quite
enough
of
a
lecture
for
once
his
mother
smiled
back
i
reckon
i
needed
it
thank
you
mums
i
turn
over
a
new
leaf
if
it
is
too
late
i
go
to
the
dance
and
i
ask
them
if
there
is
still
a
place
for
me
on
the
library
committee
and
i
start
a
troop
of
scouts
myself
another
bunch
i
had
my
eyes
on
for
some
time
that
will
please
dad
very
much
it
pleases
me
too
boys
are
very
dear
to
my
heart
i
wonder
if
you
can
guess
why
philip
my
son
i
wish
i
been
a
better
son
mums
some
chaps
never
seem
to
cause
any
worry
or
heart
ache
i
was
that
kind
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
even
yet
no
son
is
dear
unless
there
is
something
wrong
with
him
or
the
mother
mothering
means
heart
ache
and
worries
plus
joy
and
pride
and
the
joy
and
pride
more
than
makes
up
for
the
rest
it
has
for
me
a
hundred
times
over
even
when
i
had
a
rather
bad
little
boy
on
my
hands
and
now
i
have
a
man
a
man
i
am
glad
and
proud
to
call
my
son
chapter
xvii
a
wedding
ring
it
was
hard
to
remember
it
was
a
grilling
hot
august
afternoon
the
young
holidays
were
keeping
cool
as
best
they
could
out
in
the
yard
ruth
lay
in
the
canopied
hammock
against
a
background
of
a
hedge
of
sweet
peas
pink
and
white
and
lavender
looking
rather
like
a
dainty
frail
little
flower
herself
tony
in
cool
white
was
seated
on
a
scarlet
navajo
blanket
leaning
against
the
apple
tree
around
her
was
a
litter
of
magazines
and
an
open
box
of
bonbons
ted
was
stretched
at
his
ease
on
the
grass
gazing
skyward
a
cigarette
in
his
lips
enjoying
rest
after
toil
larry
occupied
the
green
garden
bench
in
the
lee
of
the
hammock
he
was
unsolaced
either
by
candy
or
smoke
and
looked
tired
and
not
particularly
happy
there
were
dark
shadows
under
his
gray
eyes
which
betrayed
that
he
was
not
getting
the
quota
of
sleep
that
healthy
youth
demands
his
eyes
were
downcast
now
apparently
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
a
belated
dandelion
at
his
feet
ruth
why
do
you
come
down
to
the
dance
with
us
tonight
demanded
tony
suddenly
dropping
her
magazine
you
are
well
enough
now
and
i
know
you
would
enjoy
it
it
is
lovely
down
on
the
island
where
the
pavilion
is
all
quiet
and
you
need
dance
if
you
want
to
you
could
just
lie
in
the
hammock
and
listen
to
the
music
and
the
water
we
come
and
talk
to
you
between
dances
so
you
would
be
lonesome
do
come
oh
i
could
ruth
voice
was
dismayed
her
blue
eyes
filled
with
alarm
at
the
suggestion
why
could
you
persisted
tony
you
are
going
to
just
hide
away
forever
are
you
it
is
awfully
foolish
is
it
larry
she
appealed
to
her
brother
he
did
not
answer
but
he
did
transfer
his
gaze
from
the
dandelion
to
ruth
as
if
he
were
considering
his
sister
proposition
sure
it
foolish
ted
replied
for
him
sitting
up
come
on
down
and
dance
the
first
foxtrot
with
me
sweetness
you
like
it
honest
you
will
when
you
get
started
oh
i
could
reiterated
ruth
that
is
nonsense
of
course
you
could
objected
tony
it
is
just
your
notion
ruthie
you
have
kept
away
from
people
so
long
you
are
scared
but
you
would
get
over
that
in
a
minute
and
truly
it
would
be
lots
better
for
you
tell
her
it
would
larry
she
is
your
patient
i
do
know
whether
it
would
or
not
returned
larry
in
his
deliberate
way
which
occasionally
exasperated
the
impulsive
tony
then
you
are
a
rotten
doctor
she
flung
back
i
know
better
than
that
myself
and
uncle
phil
agrees
with
me
i
asked
him
ruth
my
patient
as
you
reminded
me
a
moment
ago
she
is
uncle
phil
there
was
an
unusual
touchiness
in
the
young
doctor
voice
he
was
not
professionally
aggressive
as
a
rule
well
i
would
be
a
if
she
is
snapped
tony
maybe
uncle
phil
knows
a
thing
or
two
more
than
you
do
yet
and
anyway
you
are
only
a
man
and
i
am
a
girl
and
i
know
that
girls
need
people
and
fun
and
dancing
it
is
good
for
anybody
to
hide
away
by
herself
i
believe
you
are
keeping
ruth
away
from
everybody
on
purpose
the
hot
weather
and
other
things
were
setting
tony
nerves
a
bit
on
edge
she
felt
slightly
belligerent
and
not
precisely
averse
to
picking
a
quarrel
with
her
aggravatingly
quiet
brother
if
he
gave
her
half
an
opening
larry
flushed
and
scowled
at
that
and
ordered
her
sharply
not
to
talk
nonsense
whereupon
ted
intervened
i
all
on
your
side
tony
of
course
it
is
bad
for
ruth
not
to
see
anybody
but
us
any
fool
would
know
that
dancing
may
be
the
very
thing
for
her
anyhow
you
ca
tell
till
you
try
maybe
when
you
are
foxtrotting
with
me
goldilocks
you
remember
how
it
seemed
to
have
some
other
chap
arm
around
you
it
might
be
like
laying
a
fuse
i
glad
you
all
know
so
much
about
my
business
said
larry
testily
you
make
me
tired
both
of
you
oh
begged
ruth
her
blue
eyes
full
of
trouble
please
please
quarrel
about
me
i
beg
your
pardon
apologized
larry
see
here
would
you
be
willing
to
try
it
just
as
an
experiment
would
you
go
down
there
for
a
little
while
tonight
with
us
the
blue
eyes
met
the
gray
ones
if
you
wanted
me
to
faltered
the
would
you
mind
it
very
much
larry
leaned
forward
his
voice
was
low
solicitous
tony
listening
resented
it
a
little
she
did
see
why
larry
had
to
keep
his
good
manners
for
somebody
outside
the
family
he
might
have
spoken
a
little
more
politely
to
herself
she
thought
she
had
only
been
trying
to
be
nice
to
ruth
not
if
you
would
take
care
of
me
and
not
let
people
talk
to
me
too
much
ruth
answered
the
solicitous
tone
i
will
promised
larry
you
need
talk
to
a
soul
if
you
want
to
i
ward
off
and
you
can
dance
if
you
want
to
one
dance
anyway
with
me
announced
ted
complacently
from
the
grass
my
bid
was
in
first
do
you
forget
miss
peaseblossom
ted
had
a
multitude
of
pet
names
for
ruth
they
slipped
off
his
tongue
easily
as
water
falling
over
a
cliff
no
with
me
said
his
brother
shortly
gee
i
wish
i
were
a
doctor
it
gives
you
a
hideous
advantage
but
i
have
anything
to
wear
exclaimed
ruth
coming
next
to
the
really
sole
and
only
supreme
woman
question
we
fix
that
easy
as
easy
said
tony
amicable
again
now
i
a
darling
blue
organdy
that
will
look
sweet
on
you
just
the
color
of
your
eyes
do
you
worry
a
minute
honey
your
fairy
godmother
will
see
to
all
that
all
i
ask
is
that
you
wo
let
that
old
ogre
of
an
change
his
mind
and
say
you
ca
go
it
is
good
for
larry
to
obey
him
so
meekly
he
is
getting
to
be
a
regular
tyrant
a
moment
later
doctor
holiday
joined
the
group
dropped
on
the
bench
beside
larry
and
was
informed
by
tony
that
ruth
was
to
go
on
an
adventure
down
the
hill
to
sue
emerson
dance
in
fact
is
that
great
she
demanded
superb
he
teased
then
he
smiled
approval
at
ruth
good
idea
larry
he
added
to
his
nephew
glad
you
thought
of
it
i
did
think
of
it
tony
did
you
really
approve
the
gray
eyes
were
a
little
anxious
larry
was
by
no
means
a
doctor
as
his
sister
accused
him
he
had
too
little
rather
than
too
much
confidence
in
his
own
judgment
in
fact
i
certainly
do
go
to
it
little
lady
may
be
the
best
medicine
in
the
world
for
you
now
you
are
talking
exulted
ted
that
what
tony
and
i
said
and
larry
wanted
to
execute
us
on
the
spot
for
daring
to
have
an
opinion
at
all
scare
you
much
to
think
of
it
doctor
holiday
asked
ruth
prudently
ignoring
this
last
sally
a
good
deal
sighed
ruth
but
i
try
not
to
be
too
much
scared
if
larry
will
go
too
and
not
let
people
ask
questions
the
young
doctor
had
long
since
become
larry
to
ruth
it
was
too
confusing
talking
about
two
doctor
holidays
everybody
in
dunbury
said
larry
or
doctor
larry
or
at
most
respectfully
doctor
laurence
i
let
nobody
talk
to
you
but
myself
said
larry
there
you
are
flashed
tony
you
might
just
as
well
keep
her
penned
up
here
in
the
yard
you
want
to
keep
her
all
to
yourself
she
did
mean
anything
in
particular
only
to
be
a
little
disagreeable
to
pay
larry
back
for
being
so
snappy
but
to
her
amazement
ruth
was
suddenly
blushing
a
lovely
but
startling
blush
and
larry
was
bending
over
to
examine
the
in
obvious
confusion
good
gracious
she
thought
in
consternation
is
that
what
up
it
ca
be
i
just
imagining
it
larry
would
fall
in
love
with
any
one
who
wore
a
wedding
ring
he
must
but
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
whether
larry
must
or
must
not
he
had
a
thousand
signs
betrayed
the
truth
now
that
her
eyes
were
open
poor
larry
no
wonder
he
was
cross
and
unlike
himself
and
ruth
was
so
sweet
just
the
girl
for
him
and
poor
uncle
phil
she
herself
was
hurting
him
dreadfully
keeping
her
secret
about
alan
and
nobody
knew
what
ted
had
up
his
sleeve
under
his
cloak
of
incredible
virtue
and
now
here
was
larry
with
a
worse
complication
still
oh
dear
would
the
three
of
them
ever
stop
getting
into
scrapes
as
long
as
they
lived
it
was
bad
enough
when
they
were
children
it
was
infinitely
worse
now
they
were
grown
up
and
the
scrapes
were
so
horribly
serious
i
suppose
you
ca
tear
yourself
away
from
your
studies
to
attend
a
mere
dance
doctor
holiday
was
asking
of
his
younger
nephew
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
when
tony
recovered
enough
to
listen
again
ted
sent
his
cigarette
stub
careening
off
into
the
shrubbery
and
grinned
back
at
his
uncle
a
grin
half
merry
half
defiant
like
fun
i
ca
he
ejaculated
i
a
union
man
i
am
i
done
my
stunt
for
the
day
if
anybody
thinks
i
going
to
stick
my
nose
in
between
the
covers
of
a
book
before
nine
tomorrow
he
has
a
whole
orchard
of
brand
new
little
thinks
growing
up
to
stub
his
toes
on
that
all
so
the
student
life
does
improve
with
intimate
acquaintance
the
doctor
voice
was
still
teasing
but
there
was
more
than
teasing
behind
his
questions
he
was
really
interested
in
his
nephew
psychology
not
a
da
ahem
darling
bit
if
i
had
my
way
every
book
in
existence
would
be
placed
on
a
huge
funeral
pyre
and
conflagrated
instantly
moreover
it
would
be
a
criminal
offence
punishable
by
the
death
sentence
for
any
person
to
bring
another
of
the
infernal
nuisances
into
the
world
that
is
my
private
opinion
publicly
expressed
so
saying
ted
picked
himself
up
from
the
grass
and
sauntered
off
toward
the
house
his
uncle
chuckled
he
was
sorry
the
boy
did
not
take
more
cordially
to
books
since
it
looked
as
if
there
were
a
good
two
years
of
them
ahead
at
the
least
but
he
liked
the
honesty
that
would
not
pretend
to
anything
it
did
not
feel
and
he
liked
even
better
the
spirit
that
had
kept
the
lad
true
to
his
pledge
of
honest
work
without
a
squirm
or
grumble
through
all
these
weeks
of
grilling
summer
weather
when
sustained
effort
of
any
sort
particularly
mental
effort
was
undoubtedly
a
weariness
and
abomination
to
flesh
and
soul
to
his
restless
volatile
liberty
loving
young
ward
the
boy
had
certainly
shown
more
grit
and
grace
than
he
had
credited
him
with
possessing
the
village
clock
struck
six
tony
sprang
up
from
her
blanket
and
began
to
gather
up
her
possessions
i
never
get
over
a
scared
feeling
running
down
my
spine
when
the
clock
strikes
and
i
not
ready
for
supper
she
said
poor
dear
granny
she
certainly
worked
hard
trying
to
make
truly
proper
persons
out
of
us
wild
arabs
it
is
her
fault
if
she
did
succeed
is
it
larry
she
smiled
at
her
brother
a
smile
that
meant
in
tony
language
i
am
sorry
i
was
cross
let
make
up
he
smiled
back
in
the
same
spirit
he
rose
taking
the
rug
and
magazines
from
his
sister
hand
and
walked
with
her
toward
the
house
ruth
sat
up
in
her
hammock
and
smoothed
her
disarrayed
blonde
hair
i
am
glad
you
are
going
down
the
hill
said
the
doctor
to
her
it
is
a
fine
idea
little
lady
do
you
lots
of
good
doctor
holiday
i
think
i
ought
to
go
away
announced
ruth
suddenly
i
am
perfectly
well
now
and
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
stay
tired
of
us
oh
no
i
could
never
be
that
i
love
it
here
and
love
all
of
you
but
after
all
i
am
only
a
stranger
not
to
us
ruthie
listen
i
would
like
to
explain
how
i
feel
about
this
not
from
your
point
of
view
but
from
ours
tony
would
be
going
away
soon
they
needed
a
home
daughter
very
much
needed
ruth
particularly
as
she
had
such
a
wonderful
way
with
the
children
who
adored
her
and
because
granny
loved
her
so
well
though
she
did
not
love
many
people
who
were
not
holidays
and
he
and
larry
needed
her
good
fairy
ministrations
they
had
not
been
unmindful
though
perhaps
manlike
they
had
not
expressed
their
appreciation
of
the
way
fresh
flowers
found
their
way
to
the
offices
daily
and
they
were
kept
from
being
snowed
under
by
the
newspapers
of
yester
week
in
short
doctor
holiday
made
it
very
clear
that
if
ruth
cared
to
stay
she
was
wanted
and
needed
very
much
in
the
house
on
the
hill
and
ruth
touched
and
grateful
and
happy
promised
to
remain
if
you
think
it
is
all
right
she
added
with
rather
sudden
blush
for
me
to
stay
when
i
am
married
or
not
married
and
do
know
which
whereupon
doctor
holiday
who
happened
not
to
observe
the
blush
remarked
that
he
could
see
what
that
had
to
do
with
it
anyway
she
seemed
like
such
a
child
to
them
that
they
hardly
remembered
the
wedding
ring
at
all
ruth
blushed
again
at
that
and
wished
she
dared
confess
that
she
was
afraid
the
wedding
ring
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
situation
in
the
eyes
of
one
holiday
at
least
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
speak
the
fatal
word
which
might
banish
her
from
the
dear
hill
and
from
larry
who
had
come
to
be
even
dearer
a
dozen
times
while
she
was
dressing
for
the
dance
later
ruth
felt
like
crying
out
to
tony
in
the
next
room
that
she
could
not
go
that
she
dared
not
face
strangers
that
it
was
too
hard
but
she
set
her
lips
firmly
and
did
nothing
of
the
sort
larry
wanted
her
to
do
it
she
disappoint
him
if
it
killed
her
oh
dear
why
did
she
always
have
to
do
everything
as
a
case
never
just
as
a
girl
she
could
even
be
natural
as
a
girl
she
had
to
be
maybe
married
she
hated
the
ring
which
seemed
to
her
a
symbol
of
bondage
to
a
past
that
was
dead
and
yet
still
clutched
her
with
cold
hands
she
had
a
childish
impulse
to
fling
the
ring
out
of
the
window
where
she
could
never
never
see
it
again
if
it
was
for
the
ring
she
interrupted
her
own
thoughts
blushing
hotly
again
she
knew
she
had
meant
to
go
on
if
it
were
not
for
the
ring
she
could
marry
larry
holiday
she
must
think
about
that
she
must
not
forget
the
ring
nor
let
larry
forget
it
she
must
not
let
him
love
her
it
was
a
terrible
thing
she
was
doing
he
was
unhappy
dreadfully
unhappy
and
it
was
all
her
fault
and
by
and
by
they
would
all
see
it
tony
had
seen
it
today
she
was
almost
sure
and
doctor
holiday
would
see
it
he
saw
so
much
it
was
a
wonder
he
had
not
seen
it
long
before
this
they
would
hate
her
for
hurting
larry
and
spoiling
his
life
she
could
not
bear
to
have
them
hate
her
when
she
loved
them
so
and
they
had
been
so
kind
and
good
to
her
she
must
go
away
she
must
maybe
larry
would
forget
her
if
she
was
always
there
right
under
his
eyes
but
how
could
she
go
doctor
philip
would
think
it
queer
and
ungrateful
of
her
after
she
had
promised
to
stay
how
could
she
desert
him
and
the
children
and
dear
granny
and
if
she
went
what
could
she
do
what
use
was
she
anyway
but
to
be
a
trouble
and
a
burden
to
everybody
it
would
have
been
better
much
better
if
larry
had
left
her
to
die
in
the
wreck
why
did
geoffrey
annersley
come
and
get
her
if
there
was
a
geoffrey
annersley
she
knew
she
would
hate
him
but
she
wished
he
would
come
for
all
that
anything
was
better
than
making
larry
suffer
making
all
the
holidays
suffer
through
him
oh
why
had
she
died
why
had
she
but
in
her
heart
ruth
knew
she
did
not
want
to
die
she
wanted
to
live
she
wanted
life
and
love
and
happiness
and
larry
holiday
and
then
tony
stood
on
the
threshold
smiling
friendly
encouragement
ready
hon
oh
you
look
sweet
that
blue
is
lovely
for
you
it
never
suited
me
at
all
blue
is
angel
color
and
i
have
too
much
well
of
the
other
thing
in
my
composition
to
wear
it
come
on
the
boys
have
been
whistling
impatience
for
half
an
hour
and
i
do
want
to
scare
larry
out
of
going
it
is
the
first
function
he
has
condescended
to
attend
in
a
blue
moon
on
the
porch
ted
and
larry
waited
two
tall
sturdy
youths
bearing
the
indefinable
stamp
of
good
birth
and
breeding
the
inheritance
of
a
long
line
of
clean
strong
men
and
gentle
women
the
kind
of
thing
not
forged
in
one
generation
but
in
many
they
both
rose
as
the
girls
appeared
larry
crossed
over
to
ruth
his
quick
gaze
took
in
her
nervousness
and
trouble
of
mind
are
you
all
right
ruth
you
must
let
us
bully
you
into
going
if
you
really
do
want
to
no
i
am
all
right
i
do
want
to
with
you
she
added
softly
we
all
go
over
in
the
launch
announced
ted
but
larry
interposed
the
fact
that
he
and
ruth
were
going
in
the
canoe
ruth
would
get
too
tired
if
she
got
into
a
crowd
more
professional
graft
complained
ted
he
was
only
joking
but
tony
with
her
sharpened
sight
knew
that
it
was
thin
ice
for
larry
and
suspected
he
had
reasons
for
wanting
ruth
alone
in
the
canoe
with
him
that
night
poor
larry
it
was
all
a
horrible
tangle
just
as
her
affair
with
alan
was
it
was
a
night
made
for
lovers
still
and
starry
soft
little
breezes
came
tiptoeing
along
the
water
from
fragrant
nooks
ashore
and
stopped
in
their
course
to
kiss
ruth
face
as
she
lay
content
and
lovely
among
the
scarlet
cushions
reading
the
eloquent
message
of
larry
gray
eyes
they
did
not
talk
much
they
were
both
a
little
afraid
of
words
they
felt
as
if
they
could
go
on
riding
in
perfect
safety
along
the
edge
of
the
precipice
so
long
as
neither
looked
over
or
admitted
out
loud
that
there
was
a
precipice
chapter
xviii
a
young
man
in
love
the
dance
was
well
in
progress
when
larry
and
ruth
arrived
the
latter
was
greeted
cordially
and
not
too
impressively
by
gay
little
sue
emerson
their
hostess
and
her
friends
ruth
was
ensconced
comfortably
in
a
big
chair
where
she
could
watch
the
dancers
and
talk
as
much
or
little
as
she
pleased
everybody
was
so
pleasant
and
natural
and
uncurious
that
she
did
not
feel
frightened
or
strange
at
all
and
really
enjoyed
the
little
court
she
held
between
dances
pretty
girls
and
pleasant
lads
came
to
talk
with
her
the
latter
besieging
her
with
invitations
to
dance
which
she
refused
so
sweetly
that
they
found
the
little
goldilocks
more
charming
than
ever
for
her
very
denial
they
rallied
larry
however
on
his
rigorous
dragonship
and
finally
ruth
herself
dismissed
him
to
dance
with
his
hostess
as
a
proper
guest
should
she
never
meant
he
must
stick
to
her
every
moment
anyway
that
was
absurd
he
rose
to
obey
reluctantly
but
paused
to
ask
if
she
dance
with
him
just
once
no
she
could
did
even
know
whether
she
could
he
must
try
to
make
her
and
seeing
she
was
in
earnest
larry
left
her
but
ted
came
skating
down
the
floor
to
her
and
he
begged
for
just
one
dance
oh
i
could
ted
truly
i
could
she
denied
but
obeying
a
sudden
impulse
ted
had
swooped
down
upon
her
picked
her
up
and
before
she
really
knew
what
was
happening
she
had
slid
into
step
with
him
and
was
whirling
off
down
the
floor
in
his
arms
did
i
tell
you
sweetness
he
exulted
of
course
you
can
dance
what
fairy
ca
tired
he
bent
over
to
ask
with
the
instinctive
gentleness
that
was
in
all
holiday
men
ruth
shook
her
head
she
was
exhilarated
excited
tense
happy
she
could
dance
she
could
it
was
as
easy
and
natural
as
breathing
she
did
not
want
to
stop
she
wanted
to
go
on
and
on
then
suddenly
something
snapped
they
came
opposite
sue
and
larry
the
former
called
a
gay
greeting
and
approval
larry
said
nothing
his
face
was
dead
white
his
gray
eyes
black
with
anger
both
ted
and
ruth
saw
and
understood
and
the
lilt
went
out
of
the
dance
for
both
of
them
oh
lord
groaned
ted
now
i
done
it
i
sorry
ruth
i
suppose
the
old
man
would
care
do
see
why
he
should
it
you
are
willing
come
on
just
one
more
round
before
the
music
stops
and
both
beheaded
but
ruth
shook
her
head
there
was
no
more
joy
for
her
after
that
one
glimpse
of
larry
face
take
me
to
a
seat
ted
please
i
tired
he
obeyed
and
she
sank
down
in
the
chair
white
and
trembling
utterly
exhausted
she
was
hurt
and
aching
through
and
through
how
could
she
how
could
she
have
done
that
to
larry
when
he
loved
her
so
how
could
she
have
let
ted
make
her
dance
with
him
when
she
had
refused
to
dance
with
larry
no
wonder
he
was
angry
it
was
terrible
cruel
but
he
must
make
a
scene
with
ted
he
must
she
cast
an
apprehensive
glance
around
the
room
larry
was
invisible
a
forlornness
came
over
her
a
despair
such
as
she
had
never
experienced
even
in
that
dreadful
time
after
the
wreck
when
she
realized
she
had
forgotten
everything
she
felt
as
if
she
were
sinking
down
down
in
a
fearful
black
sea
and
that
there
was
no
help
for
her
anywhere
larry
had
deserted
her
would
he
never
come
back
in
a
minute
tony
and
the
others
were
beside
her
full
of
sympathetic
questions
how
had
it
seemed
to
dance
again
was
it
great
to
find
she
could
still
do
it
how
had
she
dared
to
do
it
while
larry
was
off
guard
why
would
she
could
she
dance
with
this
one
or
that
one
if
she
could
dance
with
ted
holiday
but
they
were
quick
to
see
she
was
really
tired
and
troubled
and
soon
left
her
alone
to
tony
ministrations
ruth
what
is
the
trouble
where
is
larry
and
ted
is
gone
too
what
happened
tony
voice
was
anxious
she
had
seen
larry
face
but
she
knew
larry
and
could
guess
at
the
rest
ted
made
me
dance
with
him
i
did
mean
to
but
when
we
got
started
i
could
bear
to
stop
it
was
so
wonderful
to
do
it
and
to
find
i
could
i
am
afraid
larry
did
like
it
i
presume
he
did
said
larry
sister
drily
let
him
be
angry
if
he
wants
to
be
such
a
silly
it
was
quite
all
right
ruthie
ted
has
just
as
much
right
to
dance
with
you
as
larry
has
i
am
afraid
larry
does
think
so
and
i
do
think
so
either
tony
squeezed
the
other
girl
hand
never
mind
honey
you
must
take
it
like
that
you
are
all
of
a
tremble
larry
has
a
fearful
temper
but
he
will
hang
on
to
it
for
your
sake
if
for
no
other
reason
he
wo
really
quarrel
with
ted
he
never
does
any
more
and
he
wo
say
a
word
to
you
i
rather
he
would
sighed
ruth
you
are
all
so
good
to
me
and
i
am
making
a
dreadful
lot
of
trouble
for
you
all
the
time
though
i
mean
to
and
i
love
you
so
it
is
your
fault
ruthie
not
a
single
speck
of
it
oh
yes
i
mean
just
what
you
mean
not
simply
larry
being
so
foolish
as
to
lose
his
temper
about
this
little
thing
but
the
whole
big
thing
of
your
caring
for
each
other
it
is
all
hard
and
mixed
up
and
troublesome
but
you
are
not
to
blame
and
larry
is
to
blame
and
it
will
all
come
out
right
somehow
it
has
to
as
soon
as
ted
had
assured
himself
that
ruth
was
all
right
in
his
sister
charge
he
had
looked
about
for
larry
sue
was
perched
on
a
table
eating
marshmallows
she
had
purloined
from
somewhere
with
phil
lambert
beside
her
but
there
was
no
larry
to
be
seen
ted
stepped
outside
the
pavilion
he
was
honestly
sorry
his
brother
was
hurt
and
angry
he
realized
too
late
that
maybe
he
had
behaved
quite
fairly
or
wisely
in
capturing
ruth
like
that
though
he
had
meant
any
harm
and
had
had
not
the
faintest
idea
larry
would
really
care
care
enough
to
be
angry
as
ted
had
not
seen
him
for
many
a
long
day
temper
had
once
been
one
of
the
most
active
of
the
family
skeletons
it
had
not
risen
easily
but
when
it
did
woe
betide
whatever
or
whomever
it
met
in
collision
by
comparison
with
larry
rare
outbursts
of
rage
tony
frequent
ebullitions
were
as
summer
zephyrs
to
whirlwinds
but
that
was
long
past
history
larry
had
worked
manfully
to
conquer
his
familiar
demon
and
had
so
far
succeeded
that
sunny
ted
had
all
but
forgotten
the
demon
ever
existed
but
he
remembered
now
had
remembered
with
consternation
when
he
saw
the
black
passion
in
the
other
face
as
they
met
on
the
floor
of
the
dance
hall
puzzled
and
anxious
he
stared
down
the
slope
toward
the
water
larry
was
just
stepping
into
the
canoe
was
he
going
home
leaving
ruth
to
the
mercies
of
the
rest
of
them
or
was
he
just
going
off
temporarily
by
himself
to
fight
his
temper
to
a
finish
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
do
long
ago
when
he
had
learned
to
be
afraid
and
ashamed
of
giving
into
it
ted
hesitated
a
moment
debating
whether
to
call
him
back
and
get
the
row
over
if
row
there
was
to
be
or
to
let
him
get
away
by
himself
as
he
probably
desired
hang
it
it
my
fault
i
ca
let
him
go
off
like
that
it
just
about
kills
him
to
take
it
out
of
himself
that
way
i
rather
he
take
it
out
of
me
with
which
conclusion
ted
shot
down
the
bank
whistling
softly
the
old
holiday
hill
call
the
one
dick
had
used
that
day
on
the
campus
to
summon
himself
to
the
news
that
maybe
larry
was
killed
larry
did
not
turn
ted
reached
the
shore
with
one
stride
larry
he
called
i
say
larry
no
answer
the
older
lad
picked
up
the
paddle
prepared
grimly
to
push
off
deaf
to
all
intents
and
purposes
to
the
appeal
in
the
younger
one
voice
but
ted
holiday
was
not
an
easily
daunted
person
with
one
flying
leap
he
landed
in
the
canoe
all
but
upsetting
the
craft
in
his
sudden
descent
upon
it
the
two
youths
faced
each
other
larry
was
still
white
and
his
sombre
eyes
blazed
with
half
subdued
fires
he
looked
anything
but
hospitable
to
advances
however
well
meant
better
quit
he
advised
slowly
in
a
queer
quiet
voice
which
ted
knew
was
quiet
only
because
larry
was
making
it
so
by
a
mighty
effort
of
will
i
not
responsible
just
now
we
both
be
sorry
if
you
leave
me
alone
i
wo
quit
larry
i
ca
it
was
my
fault
confound
it
old
man
please
listen
i
did
mean
to
make
you
mad
come
ashore
and
punch
my
fool
head
if
it
will
make
you
feel
any
better
still
larry
said
nothing
just
sat
hunched
in
a
heap
running
his
fingers
over
the
handle
of
the
paddle
he
no
longer
even
looked
at
ted
his
mouth
was
set
at
its
stubbornest
ted
rushed
on
desperately
in
earnest
entirely
sincere
in
his
willingness
to
undergo
any
punishment
himself
to
help
larry
honest
i
did
mean
to
make
trouble
he
pleaded
i
just
picked
her
up
and
made
her
dance
on
impulse
though
she
told
me
she
would
and
could
i
never
thought
for
a
minute
you
would
care
maybe
it
was
a
mean
trick
i
can
see
it
might
have
looked
so
but
i
did
intend
it
that
way
gee
larry
say
something
do
swallow
it
all
like
that
get
it
out
of
your
system
i
rather
you
give
me
a
dozen
black
eyes
than
sit
still
and
feel
like
the
devil
larry
looked
up
then
his
face
relaxed
its
sternness
a
little
even
the
hottest
blaze
of
wrath
could
not
burn
quite
so
fiercely
when
exposed
to
a
generous
penitence
like
his
young
brother
he
understood
ted
was
working
hard
not
only
to
make
peace
but
to
spare
himself
the
sharp
battle
with
the
demon
which
as
none
knew
better
that
larry
holiday
did
indeed
half
kill
cut
it
ted
he
ordered
grimly
said
i
have
the
slightest
desire
to
give
you
even
one
black
eye
at
present
though
i
may
as
well
admit
if
you
had
been
in
my
hands
five
minutes
ago
something
would
have
smashed
do
i
know
it
ted
grinned
a
little
gee
i
thought
my
hour
had
struck
what
made
you
come
after
me
then
ted
grin
faded
you
know
why
i
came
old
man
you
know
i
let
you
pommel
my
head
off
any
time
if
it
could
help
you
anyhow
besides
it
was
my
fault
as
i
told
you
i
did
mean
to
be
mean
i
do
any
penance
you
say
larry
picked
up
the
paddle
your
penance
is
to
let
me
absolutely
alone
for
fifteen
minutes
you
had
better
go
ashore
though
you
will
miss
a
lot
of
dances
hang
the
dances
i
staying
ted
settled
down
among
the
cushions
against
which
ruth
blonde
head
had
nestled
a
few
hours
ago
he
took
out
his
watch
struck
a
match
looked
at
the
time
lit
a
cigarette
with
the
same
match
replaced
the
watch
and
relapsed
into
silence
the
canoe
shot
down
the
lake
impelled
by
long
fierce
strokes
larry
was
working
off
the
demon
far
away
the
rhythmic
beat
of
dance
music
reached
them
faintly
now
and
then
a
fish
leaped
and
splashed
or
a
bull
frog
bellowed
his
hoarse
better
go
home
into
the
silence
otherwise
there
was
no
sound
save
the
steady
ripple
of
the
water
under
the
canoe
presently
ted
finished
his
cigarette
sent
its
still
ruddy
remains
flashing
off
into
the
lake
where
it
fell
with
a
soft
hiss
took
out
his
watch
again
lit
another
match
considered
the
time
subtracted
gravely
looked
up
and
announced
time
up
larry
larry
laid
down
the
paddle
and
a
slow
reluctant
smile
played
around
the
corners
of
his
mouth
though
there
was
sharp
distress
still
in
his
eyes
he
loathed
losing
his
temper
like
that
it
sickened
him
filled
him
with
spiritual
nausea
a
profound
disgust
for
himself
and
his
mastering
weakness
i
been
a
fool
kid
he
admitted
i
all
right
now
you
were
a
trump
to
stand
by
me
i
appreciate
it
do
mention
it
nonchalantly
from
ted
going
back
to
the
pavilion
his
brother
nodded
resumed
the
paddle
and
again
the
canoe
shot
through
the
waters
this
time
toward
the
music
instead
of
away
from
it
i
suppose
you
know
why
your
dancing
with
ruth
made
me
go
savage
said
larry
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
damned
if
i
do
said
ted
cheerfully
it
does
matter
i
do
need
a
glossary
and
appendix
suit
yourself
as
to
the
explanations
i
put
my
foot
in
it
i
apologized
that
is
the
end
of
it
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
unless
you
want
to
say
something
more
yourself
you
do
have
to
you
know
it
was
plain
fool
movie
stuff
jealousy
that
is
the
sum
and
substance
of
it
i
in
love
with
her
i
could
stand
her
dancing
with
you
when
she
had
refused
me
i
could
almost
have
killed
you
for
a
minute
i
am
ashamed
but
i
could
help
it
that
is
the
way
it
was
now
forget
it
please
ted
swallowed
hard
and
pulled
his
forelock
in
genuine
perturbation
good
lord
larry
he
blurted
i
his
brother
held
up
an
imperious
warning
hand
i
said
it
do
make
me
want
to
dump
you
now
after
coming
through
the
rest
ted
saluted
promptly
ay
ay
sir
it
forgot
only
perhaps
you
let
me
apologize
again
underscored
now
i
understand
honest
i
no
end
sorry
larry
the
other
nodded
acceptance
of
the
underscored
apology
and
again
silence
had
its
way
as
they
landed
ted
fastened
the
canoe
and
for
a
moment
the
two
brothers
stood
side
by
side
in
the
starlight
larry
put
out
his
hand
ted
took
it
their
eyes
met
said
more
than
any
words
could
have
expressed
thank
you
ted
you
been
great
helped
a
lot
larry
voice
was
a
little
unsteady
his
eyes
were
full
of
trouble
and
shame
ought
to
after
starting
the
conflagration
said
ted
i
attend
to
the
general
explanations
you
go
to
ruth
more
than
one
person
had
wondered
at
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
the
two
holidays
it
is
quite
usual
and
far
from
unexpected
when
two
young
persons
of
the
opposite
sex
drift
off
somewhere
under
the
stars
on
a
summer
night
without
giving
any
particular
account
of
themselves
but
one
scarcely
looks
for
that
sort
of
social
or
unsocial
eccentricity
from
two
youths
especially
two
brothers
nobody
but
ruth
and
tony
and
possibly
sue
suspected
a
quarrel
but
everybody
was
curious
and
ready
to
burst
into
interrogation
upon
the
simultaneous
return
of
the
two
young
men
which
was
quite
as
sudden
as
their
vanishing
had
been
larry
and
i
had
a
wager
up
announced
ted
to
sue
in
a
perfectly
clear
distinct
voice
which
carried
across
the
length
of
the
small
hall
now
that
the
music
was
silent
he
said
he
could
paddle
down
to
the
point
current
against
him
faster
than
i
could
paddle
back
current
with
me
we
took
a
notion
to
try
it
out
tonight
please
forgive
us
susanna
my
dear
a
holiday
is
a
creature
of
impulse
you
know
sue
made
a
little
face
at
the
speaker
she
was
quite
sure
he
was
lying
about
the
wager
but
she
was
a
good
hostess
and
played
up
to
his
game
you
do
deserve
to
be
forgiven
either
of
you
she
sniffed
especially
larry
who
never
comes
to
parties
and
when
he
does
has
to
go
off
and
do
a
silly
thing
like
that
who
won
though
i
will
ask
that
she
smiled
at
ted
and
he
grinned
back
larry
of
course
give
me
a
dance
sue
i
got
my
second
wind
bless
ted
thought
tony
listening
to
her
brother
glib
excuses
thank
goodness
he
can
lie
like
that
larry
never
could
and
as
her
eyes
met
ted
a
moment
later
when
they
passed
each
other
in
the
maze
of
dancers
he
murmured
all
right
in
her
ear
and
she
was
well
content
bless
ted
indeed
meanwhile
larry
had
gone
as
ted
bade
him
straight
to
ruth
he
bent
over
her
tired
little
white
face
an
agony
of
remorse
in
his
own
ruth
forgive
me
i
never
forgive
myself
do
larry
it
is
i
who
ought
to
be
sorry
and
i
am
oh
so
sorry
you
do
know
ted
did
mean
any
harm
i
ought
not
to
have
let
him
do
it
it
was
my
fault
there
was
nobody
at
fault
except
me
and
my
fool
temper
i
am
desperately
ashamed
of
myself
ruth
i
left
you
all
alone
all
this
time
and
i
promised
i
would
you
never
trust
me
again
and
i
do
deserve
to
be
trusted
it
does
do
any
good
to
say
i
am
sorry
it
ca
undo
what
i
did
i
did
dare
stay
and
that
the
fact
i
did
know
what
i
do
to
ted
if
he
got
in
my
way
i
felt
murderous
larry
i
know
it
sounds
awful
it
is
awful
it
is
an
old
battle
i
thought
won
it
but
i
have
do
look
so
scared
though
nothing
happened
ted
came
after
me
like
the
corking
kid
he
is
and
brought
me
to
in
half
the
time
i
could
have
done
it
for
myself
it
is
thanks
to
him
here
now
but
never
mind
that
it
is
only
you
that
matters
shall
i
take
you
home
i
do
deserve
it
but
if
you
will
let
me
it
will
show
you
forgive
me
a
little
bit
anyway
he
finished
humbly
do
look
so
dreadfully
unhappy
larry
it
is
over
now
and
of
course
i
forgive
you
if
you
think
there
is
anything
to
forgive
i
so
thankful
you
did
quarrel
with
ted
i
was
awfully
worried
and
so
was
tony
she
watched
the
door
every
minute
till
you
came
back
i
suppose
so
groaned
larry
i
made
one
horrible
mess
of
everything
for
you
all
are
you
ready
to
go
i
like
to
dance
with
you
once
first
larry
if
if
you
would
like
to
would
i
like
to
larry
face
lost
its
mantle
of
gloom
was
sudden
sunshine
all
over
will
you
really
dance
with
me
after
the
rotten
way
i
behaved
of
course
i
will
i
wanted
to
all
the
time
but
i
was
afraid
but
when
ted
made
me
it
all
came
back
and
i
loved
it
only
it
was
you
i
wanted
to
dance
with
most
you
know
that
do
you
larry
dear
the
last
word
was
very
low
scarcely
more
than
a
breath
but
larry
heard
it
and
it
nearly
undid
him
a
flood
of
endearments
trembled
on
his
lips
but
ruth
held
up
a
hand
of
warning
do
larry
we
must
spoil
it
we
got
to
remember
the
ring
damn
the
ring
he
exploded
i
beg
your
pardon
larry
was
genuinely
shocked
at
his
own
bad
manners
i
do
know
why
i
such
a
brute
tonight
let
dance
and
to
the
delight
and
relief
of
the
younger
holidays
larry
and
ruth
joined
the
dancers
the
dance
over
they
made
their
farewells
larry
guided
ruth
down
the
slope
his
arm
around
her
ostensibly
for
her
support
and
helped
her
into
the
canoe
once
more
they
floated
off
over
the
quiet
water
under
the
quiet
stars
but
their
young
hearts
were
anything
but
quiet
their
love
was
no
longer
an
unacknowledged
thing
neither
knew
just
what
was
to
be
done
with
it
but
there
it
was
in
full
sight
as
both
admitted
in
joy
and
trepidation
and
silence
as
larry
held
open
the
door
for
her
to
step
inside
the
quiet
hall
he
bent
over
the
girl
a
moment
taking
both
her
hands
in
his
then
he
drew
away
abruptly
and
bolted
into
the
living
room
leaving
her
to
grope
her
way
up
stairs
in
the
dark
alone
i
wonder
she
murmured
to
herself
later
as
she
stood
before
her
mirror
shaking
out
her
rippling
golden
locks
from
their
confining
net
i
wonder
if
it
would
have
been
so
terrible
if
he
had
kissed
me
just
that
once
sometimes
i
wish
he
were
quite
so
so
holidayish
chapter
xix
two
holidays
make
confession
the
next
evening
doctor
holiday
listened
to
a
rather
elaborate
argument
on
the
part
of
his
older
nephew
in
favor
of
the
latter
leaving
dunbury
immediately
in
pursuit
of
his
specialist
training
that
he
had
planned
to
go
in
for
eventually
you
are
no
longer
contented
here
with
me
with
us
questioned
the
older
man
when
the
younger
had
ended
his
exposition
larry
quick
ear
caught
the
faint
hurt
in
his
uncle
voice
and
hastened
to
deny
the
inference
it
is
that
uncle
phil
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
happier
here
with
you
that
i
would
be
anywhere
else
in
the
world
you
have
been
wonderful
to
me
i
am
not
such
an
ungrateful
idiot
as
not
to
understand
and
appreciate
what
a
start
it
has
given
me
to
have
you
and
your
name
and
work
behind
me
only
maybe
i
been
under
your
wing
long
enough
maybe
i
ought
to
stand
on
my
feet
doctor
holiday
studied
the
troubled
young
face
opposite
him
he
was
fairly
certain
that
he
was
getting
the
whole
or
the
chief
reasons
which
were
behind
this
sudden
proposition
do
you
wish
to
go
at
once
he
asked
or
will
the
first
of
the
year
be
soon
enough
larry
flushed
and
fell
to
fumbling
with
a
paper
knife
that
lay
on
the
desk
i
i
meant
to
go
right
away
he
stammered
why
larry
was
silent
i
judge
the
evidence
is
all
in
remarked
the
older
doctor
a
little
drily
am
i
going
to
hear
the
rest
of
it
the
real
reason
for
your
decision
to
go
just
now
still
silence
on
larry
part
the
old
obstinate
set
to
his
lips
very
well
then
suppose
i
take
my
turn
i
think
you
have
quite
all
the
evidence
yourself
do
you
know
granny
is
dying
the
paper
knife
fell
with
a
click
to
the
floor
uncle
phil
no
i
did
know
of
course
i
knew
it
was
coming
but
you
mean
soon
yes
larry
i
mean
soon
how
soon
no
one
can
tell
but
i
should
say
three
months
would
be
too
long
to
allow
the
boy
brushed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
he
loved
granny
he
had
always
seemed
to
understand
her
better
than
the
others
had
and
had
been
himself
always
the
favorite
moreover
he
was
bound
to
her
by
a
peculiar
tie
having
once
saved
her
life
conquering
his
boyish
fear
to
do
so
it
was
hard
to
realize
she
was
really
going
that
no
one
could
save
her
now
i
did
know
he
said
again
in
a
low
voice
ted
will
go
back
to
college
i
shall
let
tony
go
to
new
york
to
study
as
she
wishes
just
as
you
had
your
chance
it
is
exactly
the
time
for
you
to
desert
us
my
boy
i
wo
uncle
phil
i
stay
thank
you
son
i
felt
sure
you
would
fail
us
you
never
have
but
i
wish
you
felt
as
if
you
could
tell
me
the
other
reason
or
reasons
for
going
which
you
are
keeping
back
if
it
is
they
are
stronger
than
the
one
i
have
given
you
for
staying
it
is
only
fair
that
i
should
have
them
larry
eyes
fell
a
slow
flush
swept
his
face
ran
up
to
his
very
hair
my
boy
is
it
ruth
the
gray
eyes
lifted
met
the
older
man
grave
gaze
unfalteringly
yes
uncle
phil
it
is
ruth
i
thought
you
must
have
seen
it
before
this
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
giving
myself
away
everything
i
did
or
did
do
i
have
thought
of
it
occasionally
but
dismissed
the
idea
as
too
fantastic
it
has
been
so
obvious
as
it
seemed
to
you
no
doubt
you
have
not
made
love
to
her
not
in
so
many
words
i
might
just
as
well
have
though
she
knows
if
it
were
for
the
ring
well
i
think
she
would
care
too
i
am
very
sorry
larry
it
looks
like
a
bad
business
all
round
yet
i
ca
see
that
you
have
much
to
blame
yourself
for
i
withdraw
my
objections
to
your
going
away
if
it
seems
best
to
you
to
go
i
have
a
word
to
say
i
do
know
whether
it
is
best
or
not
i
go
round
and
round
in
circles
trying
to
work
it
out
it
seems
cowardly
to
run
away
from
it
particularly
if
i
am
needed
here
a
man
ought
not
to
pull
up
stakes
just
because
things
get
a
little
hard
besides
ruth
would
think
she
had
driven
me
away
i
know
she
would
go
herself
if
she
guessed
i
was
even
thinking
of
going
and
i
could
stand
that
i
go
to
the
north
pole
myself
and
stay
forever
before
i
would
send
her
away
from
you
all
i
was
so
grateful
to
you
for
asking
her
to
stay
and
making
her
feel
she
was
needed
she
was
awfully
touched
and
pleased
she
told
me
last
night
the
senior
doctor
considered
thought
back
to
his
talk
with
ruth
poor
child
so
that
was
what
she
had
been
trying
to
tell
him
she
had
thought
she
ought
to
go
away
on
larry
account
just
as
he
was
thinking
he
ought
to
go
on
hers
poor
hapless
youngsters
caught
in
the
mesh
of
circumstances
it
was
certainly
a
knotty
problem
it
is
easy
to
say
what
is
right
and
best
to
do
he
said
after
a
moment
it
is
something
you
will
have
to
decide
for
yourself
when
you
came
to
me
you
had
decided
it
was
best
to
go
had
you
not
was
there
a
specially
urgent
reason
larry
flushed
again
and
related
briefly
the
last
night
unhappy
incident
i
horribly
ashamed
of
the
way
i
acted
he
finished
and
the
whole
thing
showed
me
i
could
count
on
my
as
i
thought
i
could
i
could
sleep
last
night
and
i
thought
perhaps
maybe
the
thing
to
do
was
to
get
out
quick
before
i
did
any
real
damage
it
does
matter
about
me
it
is
ruth
do
you
think
you
can
stay
on
and
keep
a
steady
head
for
her
sake
and
for
ours
i
can
uncle
phil
it
is
up
to
me
to
stick
and
i
do
it
uncle
phil
how
long
must
a
woman
in
ruth
position
wait
before
she
can
legally
marry
ruth
position
is
so
unique
that
i
doubt
if
there
is
any
legal
precedent
for
it
ordinarily
when
the
husband
fails
to
put
in
appearance
and
the
presumption
is
he
is
no
longer
living
the
woman
is
considered
free
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
after
a
certain
number
of
years
varying
i
believe
in
different
states
with
ruth
the
affair
does
seem
to
be
a
case
of
law
at
all
she
is
in
a
position
which
requires
the
utmost
protection
from
those
who
love
her
as
we
do
the
obligation
is
moral
rather
than
legal
i
would
let
my
mind
run
on
the
marrying
aspects
of
the
case
at
present
my
boy
i
uncle
phil
sometimes
i
think
i
just
marry
her
anyway
and
let
the
rest
of
it
take
care
of
itself
there
is
any
proof
she
is
married
not
the
slightest
shadow
of
proof
larry
argued
with
sudden
heat
his
uncle
eyebrows
went
up
steady
larry
a
wedding
ring
is
usually
considered
presumptive
evidence
of
marriage
i
do
care
flashed
the
boy
the
tension
of
the
past
weeks
suddenly
snapping
she
loves
me
i
do
see
what
right
anything
has
to
come
between
us
what
is
a
wedding
ceremony
when
a
man
and
woman
belong
to
each
other
as
we
belong
hanged
if
i
do
think
i
be
justified
in
marrying
her
tomorrow
there
is
nothing
but
a
ring
to
prevent
there
is
a
good
deal
more
than
a
ring
to
prevent
said
doctor
holiday
with
some
sternness
what
if
you
did
do
just
that
and
her
husband
appeared
in
two
months
or
six
i
do
believe
she
has
a
husband
if
she
had
he
would
have
come
after
her
before
this
we
waited
he
had
time
you
have
waited
scarcely
two
months
larry
that
is
hardly
enough
time
upon
which
to
base
finalities
what
of
it
i
half
crazy
sometimes
over
the
whole
thing
i
ca
see
things
straight
i
do
want
to
i
do
want
anything
but
ruth
whether
she
is
married
or
not
i
want
her
some
day
i
ask
her
to
go
off
with
me
and
she
will
go
she
will
do
anything
i
ask
hold
on
larry
lad
you
are
saying
things
you
do
mean
you
are
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
take
advantage
of
a
girl
defenseless
position
and
her
love
for
you
to
gratify
your
own
selfish
desires
and
perhaps
wreck
her
life
and
your
own
larry
bit
his
lip
wheeled
and
went
over
to
the
window
staring
out
into
the
night
at
last
he
turned
back
white
but
master
of
himself
again
i
beg
your
pardon
uncle
phil
you
are
right
i
was
talking
like
a
fool
of
course
i
do
nothing
of
the
kind
i
wo
do
anything
to
harm
ruth
anyway
i
wo
even
make
love
to
her
if
i
can
help
it
he
qualified
in
a
little
lower
tone
if
you
ca
you
had
better
go
at
once
said
his
uncle
still
a
bit
sternly
then
more
gently
i
know
you
do
want
to
play
the
cad
larry
i
wo
uncle
phil
i
promise
very
well
i
am
satisfied
with
your
word
remember
i
am
ready
to
help
any
way
and
if
it
gets
too
hard
i
make
it
easy
at
any
time
for
you
to
go
but
in
the
mean
time
we
wo
talk
about
it
the
least
said
the
better
larry
nodded
his
assent
to
that
and
suddenly
switched
to
another
subject
asking
his
uncle
what
he
knew
about
this
alan
massey
with
whom
tony
was
having
such
an
extensive
correspondence
his
uncle
admitted
that
he
did
know
much
of
anything
about
him
except
that
he
was
the
inheritor
of
the
rather
famous
massey
property
and
an
artist
of
some
repute
he
has
plenty
of
repute
of
other
kinds
said
larry
he
is
a
rotter
i
infer
i
made
some
inquiries
from
a
chap
who
knows
him
he
has
gone
the
pace
and
then
some
it
makes
me
sick
to
have
tony
mixed
up
with
a
chap
like
that
you
have
said
anything
to
her
yourself
no
do
dare
it
would
only
make
it
worse
for
me
to
tackle
her
neither
she
nor
ted
will
stand
any
interference
from
me
we
are
a
cranky
lot
i
am
afraid
we
all
have
what
dad
used
to
call
the
family
devil
so
far
as
i
know
you
are
the
only
person
on
record
that
can
manage
him
and
larry
smiled
rather
at
his
uncle
i
am
afraid
you
will
all
three
have
to
learn
to
manage
your
own
particular
familiar
devils
are
rather
personal
property
larry
do
i
know
it
i
got
into
mighty
close
range
with
mine
last
night
and
just
now
for
that
matter
anyway
i
am
not
prepared
to
do
any
preaching
at
anybody
at
present
but
i
would
be
awfully
grateful
to
you
if
you
will
speak
to
tony
somebody
has
to
and
you
can
do
it
a
million
times
better
than
anyone
else
very
well
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
and
thus
quietly
doctor
holiday
accepted
another
burden
on
his
broad
shoulders
the
next
day
he
found
tony
on
the
porch
reading
one
of
the
long
letters
which
came
to
her
so
frequently
in
the
now
familiar
dashing
script
got
a
minute
for
me
niece
o
mine
he
asked
tony
slid
alan
letter
back
into
its
envelope
and
smiled
up
at
her
uncle
dozens
of
them
nice
uncle
she
answered
it
is
getting
well
along
in
the
summer
and
high
time
we
decided
a
few
things
do
you
still
want
to
go
in
for
the
stage
business
in
the
fall
i
want
to
very
much
uncle
phil
if
you
think
it
is
too
much
like
deserting
granny
and
the
rest
of
you
no
you
have
earned
it
i
want
you
to
go
i
do
suppose
because
you
have
talked
about
hempel
offer
that
it
means
you
have
forgotten
it
indeed
i
have
forgotten
it
for
myself
i
would
much
rather
get
straight
on
the
stage
if
i
could
and
learn
by
doing
it
but
you
would
prefer
to
have
me
go
to
a
regular
dramatic
school
would
you
yes
tony
i
would
a
year
of
preparation
is
a
bit
too
much
to
get
your
bearings
in
before
you
take
the
grand
plunge
i
want
you
to
be
very
sure
that
the
stage
is
what
you
really
want
i
am
sure
of
that
already
i
been
sure
for
ages
but
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
do
the
thing
any
way
you
want
and
i
am
more
grateful
than
i
can
tell
you
that
you
are
on
my
side
about
it
are
you
going
to
tell
granny
it
will
about
break
her
heart
i
am
afraid
tony
eyes
were
troubled
she
did
hate
to
hurt
granny
but
on
the
other
hand
she
wait
forever
to
begin
she
did
not
see
the
shadow
that
crept
over
her
uncle
face
well
he
knew
that
long
before
tony
was
before
the
footlights
granny
would
be
where
prejudices
and
misunderstandings
were
no
more
but
he
had
no
wish
to
mar
the
girl
happiness
by
betraying
the
truth
just
now
i
think
we
are
justified
in
indulging
in
a
little
camouflage
there
he
said
we
will
tell
granny
you
are
going
to
study
art
art
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
he
added
with
a
lightness
he
was
far
from
feeling
one
thing
more
my
dear
i
have
waited
a
good
while
to
hear
something
about
the
young
man
who
writes
these
voluminous
letters
he
nodded
at
the
envelope
in
tony
lap
i
like
his
writing
but
i
should
like
to
know
something
about
him
himself
tony
flushed
and
averted
her
eyes
for
a
moment
then
she
looked
up
frankly
i
have
said
anything
because
i
did
know
what
to
say
he
is
alan
massey
the
artist
i
met
him
at
carlotta
he
wants
to
marry
me
but
you
have
not
already
accepted
him
no
i
could
he
he
is
the
kind
of
man
you
would
want
me
to
marry
he
is
trying
to
be
for
my
sake
though
i
think
he
will
succeed
i
told
him
if
he
wanted
to
ask
me
again
next
summer
i
would
tell
him
what
my
answer
would
be
he
is
on
probation
then
yes
and
you
care
for
him
i
think
so
you
do
know
it
no
uncle
phil
i
do
he
cares
so
much
for
me
so
terribly
much
and
i
do
know
whether
i
care
enough
or
not
i
should
have
to
care
a
great
deal
to
overlook
what
he
has
been
and
done
maybe
it
was
anything
but
midsummer
madness
and
his
wonderful
dancing
we
danced
almost
every
night
until
i
sent
him
away
and
when
we
danced
we
seemed
to
be
just
one
person
aside
from
his
dancing
he
fascinated
me
i
could
forget
him
or
ignore
him
he
was
is
different
from
any
man
i
ever
knew
i
feel
differently
about
him
from
what
i
ever
felt
about
any
other
man
maybe
it
is
love
maybe
it
is
i
i
thought
it
was
last
month
doctor
holiday
shook
his
head
dubiously
and
you
are
not
so
sure
now
he
questioned
not
always
admitted
tony
i
did
want
to
love
him
i
fought
it
with
all
my
might
i
did
want
to
be
bothered
with
love
i
wanted
to
be
happy
and
free
and
make
a
great
success
of
my
work
but
after
alan
came
all
those
things
did
seem
to
matter
i
am
afraid
it
goes
rather
deep
uncle
phil
sometimes
i
think
he
means
more
to
me
than
even
you
and
larry
and
ted
do
it
is
strange
it
is
kind
or
loyal
or
decent
but
that
is
the
way
it
is
i
have
to
be
honest
even
if
it
hurts
her
dark
eyes
were
wistful
and
beseeched
forgiveness
as
they
sought
her
uncle
he
did
not
speak
and
she
went
on
swiftly
earnestly
please
do
ask
me
to
break
off
with
him
uncle
phil
i
could
do
it
not
only
because
i
care
for
him
too
much
but
because
it
would
be
cruel
to
him
he
has
gotten
out
of
his
dark
forest
i
do
want
to
drive
him
back
into
it
and
that
is
what
it
would
mean
if
i
deserted
him
now
i
have
to
go
on
no
matter
what
you
or
larry
or
any
one
thinks
about
it
she
had
risen
now
and
stood
before
her
uncle
earnestly
pleading
her
lover
cause
and
her
own
it
is
fair
to
condemn
a
man
forever
because
he
has
made
mistakes
back
in
the
past
we
do
any
of
us
know
what
we
would
have
been
like
if
things
had
been
different
larry
and
ted
are
fine
i
am
proud
of
their
clean
record
it
would
be
horrible
if
people
said
things
about
either
of
them
such
as
they
say
about
alan
but
larry
and
ted
have
every
reason
to
be
fine
they
have
had
you
and
dad
and
grandfather
holiday
and
the
rest
of
them
to
go
by
they
have
lived
all
their
lives
in
the
holiday
tradition
of
what
a
man
should
be
alan
has
had
nobody
nothing
nobody
ever
helped
him
to
see
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
and
why
it
mattered
which
you
chose
he
does
see
now
he
is
trying
to
begin
all
over
again
and
begin
right
and
i
going
to
stand
by
him
i
have
to
even
if
i
have
to
go
against
you
uncle
phil
there
was
a
quiver
almost
a
sob
in
tony
voice
her
uncle
drew
her
into
his
arms
all
right
little
girl
it
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
swallow
i
hate
to
have
your
shining
whiteness
touch
pitch
even
for
a
minute
no
wait
dear
i
am
not
going
to
condemn
your
lover
if
he
is
sincerely
in
earnest
in
trying
to
clean
the
slate
i
have
only
respect
for
the
effort
you
are
right
about
much
of
it
we
can
none
of
us
afford
to
do
over
much
judging
we
are
all
sinners
more
or
less
and
there
are
a
million
things
to
be
taken
into
consideration
before
we
may
dare
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
any
human
being
it
takes
a
god
to
do
that
i
am
not
going
to
ask
you
to
give
him
up
or
to
stop
writing
or
even
seeing
him
but
i
do
want
you
to
go
slow
marriage
is
a
solemn
thing
do
wreck
your
life
from
pity
or
mistaken
devotion
better
a
now
than
a
regret
let
your
lover
prove
himself
just
as
you
have
set
him
to
do
a
woman
save
a
man
he
has
to
save
himself
but
if
he
will
save
himself
for
love
of
her
the
chances
are
he
will
stay
saved
and
his
love
is
the
real
thing
i
shall
accept
your
decision
i
sha
fight
it
in
any
way
whatever
it
is
all
i
ask
is
that
you
will
wait
the
full
year
before
you
make
any
definite
promise
of
marriage
i
will
said
tony
i
meant
to
do
that
any
way
i
am
not
such
a
foolish
child
as
maybe
you
have
been
thinking
i
was
i
am
pretty
much
grown
up
uncle
phil
and
i
have
plenty
of
sense
it
i
had
i
should
be
married
to
alan
this
minute
he
smiled
a
little
sadly
at
that
youth
youth
yes
tony
i
believe
you
have
sense
maybe
i
have
it
any
way
i
thank
the
good
lord
for
it
no
more
secrets
everything
clear
he
lifted
her
face
in
his
hands
and
looked
down
into
her
eyes
with
tender
searching
not
a
secret
i
am
very
glad
to
have
you
know
we
all
feel
better
the
moment
we
dump
all
our
woes
on
you
she
sighed
he
smiled
and
stroked
her
hair
i
had
much
rather
be
a
dumping
ground
than
be
shut
out
of
the
confidence
of
any
one
of
you
that
hurts
we
all
have
to
stand
by
larry
just
now
not
in
words
but
in
well
we
call
it
moral
support
the
poor
lad
needs
it
oh
uncle
phil
did
he
tell
you
or
did
you
guess
a
little
of
both
the
boy
is
in
a
bad
hole
tony
but
he
will
keep
out
of
the
worst
of
the
bog
he
has
grit
and
chivalry
enough
to
pull
through
somehow
and
maybe
before
many
weeks
the
mystery
will
be
cleared
for
better
or
worse
we
can
only
hope
for
the
best
and
hold
on
tight
to
larry
and
ruth
too
till
they
are
out
of
the
woods
chapter
xx
a
young
man
not
for
sale
philip
lambert
was
rather
taken
by
surprise
when
harrison
cressy
appeared
at
the
store
one
day
late
in
august
announcing
that
he
had
come
to
talk
business
and
practically
commanding
the
young
man
to
lunch
with
him
that
noon
it
was
saturday
and
phil
had
little
time
for
idle
conjecture
but
he
did
wonder
every
now
and
then
that
morning
what
business
father
could
possibly
have
with
himself
and
if
by
any
chance
carlotta
had
sent
him
later
seated
in
the
of
the
eagle
hotel
dunbury
one
hostelry
it
seemed
to
phil
that
his
host
was
distinctly
nervous
with
considerably
less
than
his
usual
brusque
dogmatic
poise
of
manner
having
left
soup
the
waiter
shuffled
away
with
the
congenital
air
of
discouragement
which
belongs
to
his
class
and
harrison
cressy
got
down
to
business
in
regard
both
to
the
soup
and
his
mission
in
dunbury
he
was
starting
a
branch
brokerage
concern
in
a
small
city
just
out
of
boston
he
needed
a
smart
young
man
to
put
at
the
head
of
it
the
smart
young
man
would
get
a
salary
of
five
thousand
a
year
plus
his
commissions
to
start
with
if
he
made
good
the
salary
would
go
up
in
proportion
in
fact
the
sky
would
be
the
limit
he
offered
the
post
to
philip
lambert
phil
laid
down
his
soup
spoon
and
stared
at
his
companion
after
a
moment
he
remarked
that
it
was
rather
unusual
to
say
the
least
to
offer
a
salary
like
that
to
an
utter
greenhorn
in
a
business
as
technical
as
brokerage
and
that
he
was
afraid
he
was
not
in
the
least
fitted
for
the
position
in
question
that
is
my
look
out
snapped
cressy
do
i
look
like
a
born
fool
philip
lambert
you
do
suppose
i
am
jumping
in
the
dark
do
you
i
have
gone
to
some
pains
to
look
up
your
record
in
college
i
found
out
you
made
good
no
matter
what
you
attempted
on
the
gridiron
in
the
classroom
everywhere
else
i
been
picking
men
for
years
and
i
gone
on
the
principle
that
a
man
who
makes
good
in
one
place
will
make
good
in
another
if
he
has
sufficient
incentive
i
suppose
the
five
thousand
is
to
be
considered
in
the
light
of
an
incentive
said
phil
it
is
five
times
the
incentive
and
more
than
i
had
when
i
started
out
grunted
his
host
what
more
do
you
want
nothing
i
do
want
so
much
i
could
earn
it
and
in
any
case
i
can
not
consider
any
change
at
present
i
have
gone
in
with
my
father
so
i
understood
but
that
is
not
a
hard
and
fast
arrangement
a
young
man
like
you
has
to
look
ahead
your
father
wo
stand
in
the
way
of
your
bettering
yourself
harrison
cressy
spoke
with
conviction
well
he
might
though
philip
had
not
known
it
his
companion
had
spent
an
hour
in
earnest
conversation
with
his
father
that
morning
harrison
cressy
knew
his
ground
there
go
ahead
cressy
stewart
lambert
had
said
at
the
close
of
the
interview
you
have
my
full
permission
to
offer
the
position
to
the
boy
and
he
has
my
full
permission
to
accept
it
he
is
free
to
go
tomorrow
if
he
cares
to
if
it
is
for
his
happiness
it
is
what
his
mother
and
i
want
but
the
younger
lambert
was
yet
to
be
reckoned
with
it
is
a
hard
and
fast
arrangement
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
he
said
quietly
now
dad
can
fire
me
i
sha
fire
myself
cressy
made
a
savage
lunge
at
a
fly
that
had
ventured
to
light
on
the
sugar
bowl
not
knowing
it
was
for
the
time
being
millionaire
sugar
bowl
he
hated
being
balked
even
temporarily
he
had
supposed
the
hardest
sledding
would
be
over
when
he
had
won
the
father
consent
he
had
authentic
inside
information
that
the
son
had
stakes
other
than
financial
he
counted
on
youth
imperious
urge
to
happiness
the
lad
had
done
without
carlotta
for
two
months
now
it
had
seemed
probable
he
would
be
more
amenable
to
reason
in
august
than
he
had
been
in
june
but
it
did
not
look
like
it
just
now
you
are
a
darn
fool
my
young
man
he
gnarled
very
likely
said
phil
lambert
with
the
same
quietness
which
had
marked
his
father
speech
earlier
in
the
day
if
you
had
a
son
cressy
would
you
want
him
to
be
the
same
kind
of
a
darn
fool
would
you
expect
him
to
take
french
leave
the
first
time
somebody
offered
him
more
money
harrison
cressy
snorted
beckoned
to
the
waiter
his
face
purple
with
rage
why
in
blankety
blank
blank
et
cetera
et
cetera
did
he
bring
the
fish
did
he
think
they
were
there
for
the
season
philip
did
not
know
he
had
probed
an
old
wound
the
one
great
disappointment
of
harrison
cressy
career
was
the
fact
that
he
had
no
son
or
had
had
one
for
such
a
brief
space
of
hours
that
he
scarcely
counted
except
as
a
pathetic
and
even
as
phil
had
said
so
he
would
have
wanted
his
son
to
behave
the
boy
was
a
man
every
inch
of
him
just
such
a
man
as
harrison
gressy
had
coveted
for
his
own
hang
the
money
part
he
snapped
back
at
phil
after
the
interlude
with
the
harrassed
waiter
let
drop
it
with
all
my
heart
agreed
phil
considering
the
money
part
hanged
what
is
left
to
the
offer
carlotta
cressy
dropped
his
fork
with
a
resounding
clatter
to
the
floor
and
swore
muttered
monotonous
oaths
at
the
waiter
for
not
being
instantaneously
on
the
spot
to
replace
the
implement
young
man
he
said
to
phil
you
are
too
devilish
smart
carlotta
is
why
i
am
here
so
i
imagined
did
she
send
you
great
scott
no
my
life
would
be
worth
a
brass
nickel
if
she
knew
i
was
here
i
am
glad
she
did
i
would
like
carlotta
to
think
i
could
be
bribed
she
did
carlotta
has
perfectly
clear
impressions
as
to
where
you
stand
she
gives
you
entire
credit
for
being
the
blind
stubborn
pigheaded
that
you
are
phil
grinned
faintly
at
this
accumulation
of
epithets
but
his
blue
eyes
had
no
mirth
in
them
the
interview
was
beginning
to
be
something
of
a
strain
he
wished
it
were
over
that
good
he
said
apparently
we
all
know
where
we
all
stand
i
have
no
illusions
about
carlotta
either
there
is
no
reason
i
should
have
i
got
it
first
hand
do
be
an
idiot
ordered
cressy
a
woman
can
have
as
many
as
there
are
days
in
the
year
counting
sundays
double
you
have
no
more
idea
this
minute
where
carlotta
stands
than
than
i
have
he
finished
ignominiously
wiping
his
perspiring
forehead
with
an
imported
linen
handkerchief
do
you
mind
telling
me
just
why
you
are
here
if
carlotta
did
send
you
i
do
flatter
myself
you
automatically
selected
me
for
your
new
post
without
some
rather
definite
reason
behind
it
i
came
because
i
had
a
notion
you
were
the
best
man
for
another
job
a
job
that
makes
the
whole
brokerage
business
look
like
a
game
of
the
job
of
marrying
my
daughter
carlotta
phil
stared
he
had
not
expected
cressy
to
take
this
position
he
had
been
ready
enough
to
believe
carlotta
prophecy
that
her
parent
would
raise
a
merry
little
row
if
she
announced
to
him
her
intention
of
marrying
that
obscure
individual
philip
lambert
of
dunbury
massachusetts
he
thought
that
particular
way
of
behavior
on
the
part
not
only
probable
but
more
or
less
justifiable
all
things
considered
he
saw
no
reason
now
why
cressy
should
feel
otherwise
harrison
cressy
drained
a
deep
draught
of
water
once
more
wiped
his
highly
shining
brow
and
leaned
forward
over
the
table
toward
his
puzzled
guest
you
see
philip
he
went
on
using
the
young
man
first
name
for
the
first
time
carlotta
is
in
love
with
you
philip
flushed
and
his
frank
eyes
betrayed
that
this
though
not
entirely
new
news
was
not
unwelcome
to
hear
in
fact
continued
carlotta
father
grimly
she
is
so
much
in
love
with
you
she
is
going
to
marry
another
man
the
light
went
out
of
phil
eyes
at
that
but
he
said
nothing
to
this
any
more
than
he
had
to
the
preceding
statement
he
waited
for
the
other
man
to
get
at
what
he
wanted
to
say
i
ca
stand
carlotta
being
miserable
i
never
could
it
is
why
i
am
here
to
see
if
i
ca
fix
up
a
deal
with
you
to
straighten
things
out
i
am
in
your
hands
boy
at
your
mercy
i
have
the
reputation
of
being
hard
as
shingle
nails
i
soft
as
putty
where
the
girl
is
concerned
it
kills
me
by
inches
to
have
her
unhappy
is
she
very
unhappy
phil
voice
was
sober
he
thought
that
he
too
was
soft
as
putty
or
softer
where
carlotta
was
concerned
it
made
him
sick
all
over
to
think
of
her
being
unhappy
she
is
damnably
unhappy
harrison
cressy
blew
his
nose
with
a
sound
as
of
a
trumpet
here
you
he
bellowed
at
the
waiter
who
was
timidly
approaching
is
that
our
steak
at
last
bring
it
here
quick
and
jibber
are
you
deaf
and
dumb
as
well
as
paralyzed
the
host
attacked
the
steak
with
ferocity
slammed
a
generous
section
on
a
plate
and
fairly
threw
it
at
the
young
man
opposite
phil
interested
in
steak
he
scarcely
looked
at
it
his
eyes
were
on
cressy
his
thoughts
were
on
that
gentleman
only
daughter
i
am
sorry
she
is
unhappy
he
said
i
do
know
how
much
you
know
about
it
all
but
since
you
know
so
much
i
assume
you
also
know
that
i
care
for
carlotta
just
as
much
as
she
cares
for
me
possibly
more
i
would
marry
her
tomorrow
if
i
could
for
the
lord
harry
sake
do
it
then
i
put
up
the
money
phil
face
hardened
that
is
precisely
the
rock
that
carlotta
and
i
split
on
cressy
she
wanted
to
have
you
put
up
the
money
i
love
carlotta
but
i
do
love
her
enough
to
let
her
or
you
buy
me
the
old
man
and
the
young
faced
each
other
across
the
table
there
was
a
deadlock
between
them
and
both
knew
it
but
this
offer
i
made
you
is
a
bona
fide
one
you
make
good
you
will
be
worth
the
five
thousand
and
more
in
no
time
i
know
your
kind
i
told
you
i
was
a
good
picker
it
is
a
question
of
buying
can
the
movie
stuff
it
a
fair
give
and
take
i
have
refused
your
offer
mr
cressy
you
refused
it
before
you
knew
carlotta
was
eating
her
heart
out
for
you
does
that
make
any
difference
to
you
my
lad
you
said
you
loved
her
reproachfully
a
huge
fly
buzzed
past
the
table
passed
on
to
the
window
where
it
fluttered
about
aimlessly
bumping
itself
against
the
pane
here
and
there
mechanically
phil
watched
its
gyrations
it
was
one
of
the
hardest
moments
of
his
life
in
one
way
it
makes
a
great
difference
cressy
he
answered
slowly
it
breaks
my
heart
to
have
her
unhappy
but
it
would
make
her
happy
to
have
me
do
something
i
know
is
right
or
fair
or
wise
i
know
carlotta
maybe
i
know
her
better
than
you
do
i
know
she
does
want
me
that
way
but
you
ca
expect
her
to
live
in
a
hole
like
this
on
a
yearly
income
that
is
probably
less
than
she
spends
in
one
month
just
for
nothing
much
i
do
expect
it
explained
phil
patiently
i
never
blamed
carlotta
for
deciding
against
it
but
there
is
no
use
going
over
it
all
she
and
i
had
it
out
together
it
is
our
affair
not
yours
mr
cressy
philip
lambert
did
you
ever
see
carlotta
cry
phil
winced
the
shot
went
home
no
i
hate
to
he
admitted
you
would
seconded
harrison
cressy
i
hated
it
like
the
devil
myself
she
cried
all
over
my
new
dress
suit
the
other
night
phil
heart
was
one
gigantic
ache
the
thought
of
carlotta
in
tears
was
almost
unbearable
carlotta
his
carlotta
was
all
sunshine
and
laughter
it
was
like
this
went
on
carlotta
parent
her
aunt
told
me
she
was
going
to
marry
young
lathrop
old
son
i
could
quite
stomach
it
the
fellow
an
ass
an
unobjectionable
ass
it
is
true
but
with
all
the
ear
marks
i
tackled
carlotta
about
it
she
said
she
was
engaged
but
might
be
any
minute
i
said
some
fool
thing
about
wanting
her
to
be
happy
and
the
next
thing
i
knew
she
was
in
my
arms
crying
like
anything
i
have
seen
her
cry
since
she
was
a
little
tot
she
has
laughed
her
way
through
life
always
up
to
now
i
could
bear
it
i
ca
bear
it
now
even
remembering
it
i
squeezed
the
story
out
of
her
drop
at
a
time
till
i
got
pretty
much
the
whole
bucket
full
i
tell
you
phil
lambert
you
got
to
give
in
i
have
her
heart
broken
you
ca
have
her
heart
broken
god
man
your
funeral
too
phil
felt
very
much
as
if
it
were
his
own
funeral
but
he
did
not
speak
he
could
the
other
forged
on
his
big
mumbling
bass
mingled
with
the
buzz
of
the
in
the
window
i
made
up
my
mind
something
had
to
be
done
and
done
quick
i
going
to
have
my
little
girl
run
her
head
into
the
noose
by
marrying
lathrop
when
it
was
you
she
loved
i
got
busy
made
inquiries
about
you
as
i
said
i
had
to
before
i
offered
you
the
job
naturally
but
it
was
more
than
that
i
had
to
find
out
whether
you
were
the
kind
of
man
i
wanted
my
carlotta
to
marry
i
found
out
and
came
up
here
to
put
the
proposition
to
you
i
talked
to
your
father
first
by
the
way
and
got
his
consent
to
go
ahead
with
my
plans
you
went
to
my
father
there
was
concern
and
a
trace
of
indignation
in
phil
voice
naturally
i
was
playing
to
win
i
had
to
hold
all
the
trumps
i
wanted
your
father
on
my
side
had
to
have
him
in
fact
he
came
without
a
murmur
he
is
a
good
sport
said
all
he
wanted
was
your
happiness
same
as
all
i
wanted
was
carlotta
we
quite
understood
each
other
phil
sat
silent
with
down
cast
eyes
on
his
almost
untasted
salad
he
could
bear
to
think
of
his
father
being
attacked
like
that
hit
with
a
lightning
bolt
out
of
a
clear
sky
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
he
resented
it
of
course
dad
would
agree
he
was
a
good
sport
as
cressy
said
rut
that
did
make
the
thing
any
easier
or
more
justifiable
your
father
is
willing
i
want
it
carlotta
wants
it
you
want
it
yourself
lord
boy
be
honest
you
know
you
do
you
never
regret
giving
in
remember
it
is
for
carlotta
happiness
we
are
both
looking
for
there
was
an
almost
pleading
note
in
harrison
cressy
voice
a
note
few
men
had
heard
he
was
more
used
to
command
than
to
sue
for
what
he
desired
phil
rose
from
the
table
his
face
was
a
little
white
as
he
stood
there
tall
quiet
perfectly
master
of
himself
and
the
situation
even
before
the
young
man
spoke
harrison
cressy
knew
he
had
failed
i
am
sorry
cressy
if
carlotta
wants
happiness
with
me
i
am
afraid
she
will
have
to
come
to
dunbury
you
wo
reconsider
there
is
nothing
to
reconsider
there
never
was
any
question
i
am
sorry
you
even
raised
one
in
dad
mind
you
should
have
gone
to
him
in
the
first
place
you
should
have
come
to
me
it
was
for
me
to
settle
highty
tighty
fumed
the
exasperated
magnate
people
do
tell
me
what
i
should
and
should
not
do
they
do
what
i
tell
i
do
said
philip
lambert
in
much
the
same
tone
he
had
once
said
to
carlotta
you
ca
have
this
i
am
sorry
cressy
i
do
want
to
be
rude
or
unkind
or
obstinate
but
there
are
some
things
no
man
can
decide
for
me
and
there
are
some
things
i
wo
do
even
to
win
carlotta
harrison
cressy
head
drooped
for
a
moment
he
was
beaten
for
once
beaten
by
a
lad
of
whose
will
was
quite
as
strong
as
his
own
the
worst
of
it
was
he
had
never
liked
any
young
man
in
his
life
so
well
as
he
liked
philip
lambert
at
this
minute
never
so
coveted
any
thing
for
his
daughter
carlotta
as
he
coveted
her
marriage
with
philip
lambert
that
is
final
i
suppose
he
asked
after
a
moment
looking
up
at
the
young
man
absolutely
cressy
i
am
sorry
harrison
cressy
lumbered
to
his
feet
i
am
sorry
too
he
said
damnably
sorry
for
carlotta
and
for
myself
will
you
shake
hands
with
me
philip
it
is
good
to
meet
a
man
now
and
then
chapter
xxi
harrison
cressy
reverts
left
to
himself
harrison
cressy
discovered
to
his
annoyance
that
there
was
no
train
out
of
dunbury
for
two
hours
that
was
the
worst
of
these
little
towns
you
might
as
well
be
dead
as
alive
in
by
the
time
he
had
smoked
his
cigar
he
felt
as
if
he
might
as
well
be
dead
himself
he
felt
suddenly
heavy
old
almost
decrepit
though
that
morning
when
he
had
left
boston
he
had
considered
himself
in
the
prime
of
life
and
vigor
hang
it
he
was
a
man
was
about
done
for
at
all
but
ready
to
turn
into
his
grave
and
he
without
son
or
grandson
lord
what
a
swindle
life
was
anyway
well
there
was
no
use
sitting
still
groaning
he
would
get
up
and
take
a
little
walk
until
train
time
maybe
it
was
his
liver
that
made
him
feel
so
confoundedly
rotten
and
no
count
a
little
exercise
would
do
him
good
absentmindedly
he
noted
as
he
strolled
down
the
streets
the
neatness
of
the
lawns
the
gay
flower
beds
the
hammocks
and
swings
out
under
the
trees
as
if
people
really
lived
out
of
doors
here
there
were
animate
evidences
of
the
fact
everywhere
children
played
here
and
there
in
shady
spaces
under
big
trees
pretty
girls
on
wide
porches
chatted
and
drank
lemonade
and
knitted
a
lithe
lass
in
white
played
tennis
on
a
smooth
dirt
court
with
a
tall
clean
looking
youth
as
cressy
passed
the
girl
cried
out
love
all
and
the
millionaire
smiled
it
occurred
to
him
it
was
not
so
hard
to
love
all
in
a
village
like
this
it
was
only
in
cities
that
you
hated
your
neighbor
and
did
him
first
lest
you
be
done
yourself
he
had
been
loose
in
a
country
town
like
this
for
years
he
had
almost
forgotten
what
they
were
like
when
you
did
shoot
through
them
in
a
motor
car
rushing
always
to
get
somewhere
else
his
casual
saunter
down
the
quiet
street
was
oddly
soothing
to
his
nerves
awoke
happy
yet
memories
he
had
met
and
loved
carlotta
mother
in
a
country
town
the
lilacs
had
been
in
bloom
and
the
orioles
had
stood
sponsor
for
his
first
sunday
call
they
had
become
engaged
by
the
time
the
asters
were
out
the
next
lilac
time
they
had
been
married
a
third
spring
and
the
little
carlotta
had
come
they
had
both
been
disappointed
at
its
not
being
a
boy
but
the
little
girl
was
a
wonder
with
hair
as
gold
as
buttercups
eyes
like
wood
violets
and
a
laugh
that
lilted
and
gurgled
like
the
little
brook
down
in
the
meadow
and
then
two
years
later
the
boy
had
come
come
and
drifted
off
to
some
far
place
it
had
been
a
bitter
blow
to
rose
as
well
as
to
harrison
cressy
especially
as
they
said
there
never
could
be
any
more
children
rose
grew
frail
did
not
rally
or
regain
her
strength
they
advised
a
sanitarium
in
the
adirondacks
for
her
she
had
gone
but
it
had
been
of
no
use
by
the
time
they
brought
in
the
first
gentians
rose
had
drifted
off
after
her
little
son
carlotta
and
her
father
were
alone
by
this
time
harrison
cressy
had
begun
to
show
the
authentic
midas
touch
only
the
little
carlotta
stood
between
him
and
sheer
sordid
money
grubbing
and
even
she
was
an
excuse
for
the
getting
of
always
more
and
more
wealth
he
told
himself
carlotta
should
be
a
veritable
princess
should
go
always
clad
in
the
finest
have
of
the
best
be
surrounded
always
by
the
most
beautiful
she
should
know
only
joy
and
light
and
laughter
thinking
these
thoughts
carlotta
father
sighed
for
now
at
last
carlotta
wanted
something
he
could
not
give
her
was
learning
after
years
of
cloudless
joy
the
bitter
way
of
tears
why
that
stubborn
boy
surrendered
for
that
matter
why
did
carlotta
surrender
this
was
a
new
idea
to
harrison
cressy
all
the
time
he
had
been
talking
to
philip
lambert
he
had
been
seeing
carlotta
only
in
relation
to
crest
house
and
the
beacon
street
mansion
but
just
now
he
had
been
recalling
her
mother
under
very
different
associations
rose
had
been
content
with
a
tiny
little
cottage
set
in
a
green
yard
gay
with
bright
old
fashioned
flowers
he
and
rose
had
nested
as
happily
as
the
orioles
in
the
maples
especially
after
the
baby
came
was
carlotta
so
different
from
rose
was
her
happiness
such
a
different
kind
of
thing
were
women
not
pretty
much
alike
at
heart
did
they
not
want
about
the
same
things
carlotta
loved
this
lad
of
hers
as
rose
had
loved
himself
was
it
her
own
father
who
was
cheating
her
out
of
happiness
because
he
had
taught
her
to
believe
that
money
and
limousines
and
great
houses
and
many
servants
and
silken
robes
are
happiness
if
he
had
talked
to
her
of
other
things
told
her
about
her
mother
and
the
happy
old
days
among
the
lilacs
and
orioles
with
little
but
love
to
nest
with
could
he
have
made
her
see
things
more
truly
shown
her
that
love
was
the
main
thing
that
money
could
not
buy
happiness
one
could
not
buy
much
of
anything
that
was
worth
buying
harrison
cressy
thought
one
could
purchase
only
the
worthless
that
was
the
everlasting
failure
of
money
he
remembered
the
boy
i
love
carlotta
but
i
do
love
her
enough
to
let
her
or
you
buy
me
it
was
true
neither
he
nor
his
daughter
had
been
able
to
purchase
the
lad
integrity
his
good
faith
his
ideals
and
harrison
cressy
was
thankful
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
that
it
was
so
he
turned
his
steps
back
to
the
village
and
as
he
did
so
an
oriole
flashed
out
of
the
shrubbery
near
him
and
passed
like
a
flame
out
of
sight
among
the
trees
this
was
a
good
sign
orioles
had
nested
every
year
in
the
maple
tree
by
the
little
white
house
where
carlotta
had
been
born
carlotta
herself
had
always
loved
them
pretty
pretty
birdie
she
had
been
wont
to
call
out
come
daddy
let
follow
him
and
see
where
he
goes
he
would
go
home
and
tell
carlotta
all
this
make
her
see
that
her
happiness
was
in
her
own
hands
no
it
was
the
boy
story
if
carlotta
would
not
follow
the
orioles
and
her
own
heart
for
philip
lambert
she
would
not
for
any
argument
of
his
by
this
time
a
distant
puff
of
smoke
gave
evidence
that
the
boston
train
was
already
on
its
way
leaving
harrison
cressy
in
dunbury
not
that
he
cared
he
had
business
still
to
transact
ere
he
departed
a
new
battle
to
fight
he
walked
with
the
firm
elastic
step
of
a
youth
back
to
town
what
did
it
matter
if
you
were
when
the
best
things
of
life
were
still
ahead
of
you
accordingly
phil
was
a
second
time
that
day
surprised
by
the
unheralded
arrival
of
carlotta
father
a
rather
dusty
weary
and
gentleman
this
time
but
exuding
a
sort
of
benignant
serenity
that
had
not
been
there
early
in
the
day
hello
greeted
the
millionaire
blandly
missed
my
train
got
to
browsing
round
the
town
like
an
old
billy
goat
not
sorry
though
it
is
a
nice
little
town
mind
if
i
sit
down
i
a
bit
blown
and
dropping
on
a
stool
cressy
fanned
himself
with
his
panama
and
grinned
at
philip
a
grin
the
young
man
could
not
quite
fathom
what
new
trick
had
the
clever
old
financier
at
the
bottom
of
his
mind
phil
hoped
he
had
not
got
to
go
through
the
thing
again
once
had
been
quite
enough
for
one
day
let
me
send
out
for
something
cool
to
drink
cressy
you
must
be
horribly
hot
it
is
warm
in
here
even
with
all
the
fans
going
hi
there
tommy
philip
summoned
a
freckled
youth
from
somewhere
in
the
background
run
over
to
greene
and
get
a
lemonade
for
this
gentleman
will
you
right
mr
phil
the
boy
saluted
an
odd
salute
cressy
noted
it
was
rendered
with
the
right
hand
the
three
middle
fingers
held
up
the
thumb
bent
over
touching
the
nail
of
the
little
finger
the
saluter
stood
very
straight
as
he
went
through
the
ceremony
and
looked
very
serious
about
it
queer
thought
the
onlooker
the
messenger
boys
he
knew
did
not
behave
like
that
when
you
gave
them
an
order
philip
excused
himself
to
attend
to
a
customer
and
in
a
moment
the
lad
was
back
with
a
tall
glass
of
lemonade
clinking
delightfully
with
ice
cressy
took
it
and
set
it
down
on
the
counter
while
he
fumbled
for
his
wallet
and
produced
a
dollar
bill
to
his
amazement
the
boy
grin
faded
and
he
drew
himself
up
with
dignity
no
thank
you
sir
he
said
to
the
proffered
greenback
i
a
scout
and
scouts
do
take
tips
what
gasped
harrison
cressy
in
all
his
life
he
did
not
recall
meeting
a
boy
who
ever
refused
money
before
he
began
to
think
there
was
something
uncanny
about
this
town
of
dunbury
first
a
young
man
who
could
not
be
bought
at
any
price
and
now
a
boy
who
would
take
a
tip
for
service
rendered
i
said
i
was
a
scout
repeated
the
lad
patiently
and
scouts
take
tips
we
are
supposed
to
do
one
good
turn
every
day
anyway
and
i
had
gotten
mine
in
before
i
only
a
tenderfoot
but
i
most
ready
for
my
second
class
tests
phil
going
to
try
me
out
in
first
aid
as
soon
as
he
gets
time
phil
what
he
got
to
do
with
it
inquired
cressy
after
a
long
satisfying
swig
of
lemonade
he
is
our
and
a
peach
of
a
one
too
he
is
going
to
take
us
on
a
hike
tomorrow
tomorrow
tomorrow
is
sunday
young
man
the
methodist
in
harrison
cressy
rose
to
the
surface
i
know
we
all
go
to
church
and
sunday
school
in
the
morning
phil
wo
take
us
unless
we
do
but
in
the
afternoon
he
thinks
it
is
all
right
to
go
on
a
hike
we
do
practise
signaling
and
things
like
that
but
we
get
in
a
lot
of
nature
study
i
can
identify
all
my
ten
trees
now
and
a
whole
lot
more
besides
and
i
got
a
bird
list
of
over
sixty
you
do
say
so
harrison
cressy
was
plainly
impressed
so
your
phil
gives
a
good
deal
of
time
to
that
sort
of
thing
does
he
he
added
his
eyes
seeking
philip
lambert
in
the
distance
should
say
he
did
i
guess
he
gives
about
all
the
time
he
has
outside
of
the
store
he
a
dandy
what
he
says
goes
you
betcher
remembering
the
scene
at
the
luncheon
table
that
day
harrison
cressy
thought
it
quite
probable
what
philip
had
said
had
gone
you
betcher
on
that
occasion
with
a
vengeance
so
young
lambert
gave
his
off
hours
to
business
of
this
sort
most
of
carlotta
male
friends
gave
most
of
theirs
to
polo
jazz
and
chorus
girls
he
began
to
covet
philip
more
than
ever
for
a
possible
and
he
hoped
probable
it
played
into
his
purposes
excellently
that
philip
on
returning
invited
him
to
supper
on
the
hill
that
night
he
wanted
to
meet
the
boy
people
especially
the
mother
carlotta
had
told
him
once
that
philip
mother
was
the
most
wonderful
person
in
the
world
seated
at
the
long
table
in
the
lambert
harrison
cressy
enjoyed
a
meal
such
as
his
soul
had
almost
forgotten
could
exist
a
meal
so
simple
yet
so
delectable
that
he
dreamed
of
it
for
days
afterward
but
the
food
excellent
as
it
was
was
only
a
small
part
of
the
significance
of
the
occasion
it
was
a
revelation
to
the
millionaire
to
know
that
a
family
could
gather
around
the
board
like
this
and
have
such
a
thoroughly
delightful
time
all
round
there
was
gay
talk
and
ready
laughter
a
fine
flavor
of
courtesy
and
hospitality
and
good
will
in
everything
that
was
said
or
done
the
lambert
girls
the
pretty
twins
and
the
younger
slim
slip
of
a
lassie
elinor
were
charming
fresh
natural
unspoiled
very
different
from
and
far
more
to
his
taste
than
most
of
the
young
women
who
came
to
crest
house
products
cynical
too
familiar
with
rouge
and
cigarettes
and
the
game
of
love
and
lure
huntresses
more
or
less
the
whole
pack
of
them
it
seemed
girls
could
still
be
plain
girls
on
this
enchanted
hill
girls
who
would
make
wonderful
wives
some
day
for
some
lucky
men
but
the
mother
she
was
the
secret
of
it
all
quite
as
remarkable
as
carlotta
had
said
she
was
extraordinarily
well
read
talked
well
on
a
dozen
subjects
as
to
which
he
was
himself
but
vaguely
informed
and
she
was
evidently
even
more
extraordinarily
busy
there
was
talk
of
a
better
babies
movement
in
which
she
was
interested
of
a
red
cross
chapter
at
which
she
had
spent
the
afternoon
of
a
committee
meeting
of
the
local
woman
club
which
was
bringing
a
noted
english
to
town
there
were
chatauqua
plans
in
view
and
a
new
children
reading
room
in
the
public
library
with
a
hour
of
which
clare
was
to
be
in
charge
a
hundred
things
indicated
that
lambert
was
by
no
means
confined
to
the
four
walls
of
her
home
for
interests
and
activities
yet
her
home
was
exquisitely
kept
and
she
was
a
mother
first
of
all
one
could
see
that
every
moment
it
was
mums
this
and
mums
that
from
them
all
the
life
of
the
home
clearly
pivoted
about
her
harrison
cressy
found
himself
wishing
that
carlotta
could
have
known
a
motherhood
like
that
rose
had
gone
so
soon
carlotta
had
never
known
what
she
missed
perhaps
cressy
himself
had
not
known
until
he
saw
lambert
and
realized
what
a
mother
might
be
poor
carlotta
he
had
given
her
a
great
deal
at
least
until
this
afternoon
he
had
thought
he
had
but
he
had
never
given
her
anything
at
all
comparable
to
what
this
quiet
village
and
his
wife
had
given
to
their
son
and
daughters
he
had
had
it
to
give
he
had
been
poor
after
all
all
along
though
he
had
suspected
it
until
now
after
supper
stuart
lambert
had
slipped
quickly
away
bidding
his
son
stay
up
on
the
hill
a
little
longer
with
their
guest
phil
had
demurred
but
had
been
quietly
overruled
and
had
acquiesced
perforce
poor
dad
there
had
not
been
a
moment
all
day
to
relieve
his
mind
about
cressy
offer
not
once
had
the
father
and
son
been
alone
phil
was
afraid
his
father
was
taking
the
thing
a
good
deal
to
heart
and
it
worried
him
he
had
counted
on
talking
it
over
together
as
they
went
back
to
the
store
but
his
father
had
willed
otherwise
it
was
with
carlotta
father
instead
of
his
own
that
philip
talked
first
after
all
see
here
philip
began
cressy
as
they
descended
the
hill
in
lizzie
i
went
at
this
all
wrong
so
did
carlotta
i
understand
better
now
i
been
back
in
the
past
this
afternoon
remembering
what
it
means
to
live
in
the
country
and
love
and
mate
there
in
the
good
way
as
carlotta
mother
and
i
did
it
is
what
i
want
her
to
do
with
you
do
you
get
that
boy
i
want
her
to
come
to
dunbury
i
want
her
to
have
a
piece
of
your
mother
carlotta
never
knew
what
it
was
to
have
a
mother
it
is
mostly
my
fault
she
does
see
any
clearer
you
must
blame
her
lad
i
do
said
phil
i
love
her
i
know
you
do
and
she
loves
you
go
to
her
make
her
see
make
her
marry
you
and
be
happy
phil
was
silent
not
because
he
was
not
moved
by
the
older
man
plea
but
because
he
was
almost
too
moved
to
speak
it
rather
took
his
breath
away
to
have
harrison
cressy
on
his
side
like
this
it
was
almost
too
incredible
and
yet
there
was
no
mistaking
the
sincerity
in
the
words
or
on
his
face
carlotta
father
did
want
carlotta
to
come
to
him
on
his
hill
but
would
carlotta
want
it
that
was
the
question
for
himself
he
sought
no
higher
road
to
follow
than
the
one
where
his
father
and
mother
had
blazed
the
trail
through
fair
weather
and
stormy
these
many
years
but
would
carlotta
be
content
to
travel
so
with
him
he
did
not
know
at
any
rate
he
could
ask
her
try
once
more
to
make
her
see
as
her
father
put
it
he
turned
to
his
companion
with
a
sober
smile
at
this
point
in
his
reflections
thank
you
cressy
i
will
try
again
and
i
know
it
is
going
to
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
to
carlotta
and
to
me
to
have
you
on
my
side
perhaps
she
will
see
it
differently
this
time
i
hope
so
lord
boy
so
do
i
groaned
cressy
you
will
come
back
to
crest
house
tomorrow
with
me
phil
hesitated
considered
shook
his
head
i
come
next
saturday
i
ca
get
away
tomorrow
he
said
why
not
for
the
lord
sake
boy
get
it
over
phil
smiled
but
shook
his
head
he
too
wanted
to
get
it
over
he
could
hardly
wait
to
get
to
carlotta
would
have
started
that
moment
if
he
could
have
done
so
but
there
were
reasons
why
he
could
not
go
tomorrow
obligations
that
held
him
fast
in
dunbury
i
ca
go
tomorrow
because
i
have
promised
my
boys
a
hike
he
explained
harrison
cressy
nearly
exploded
heavens
man
what
does
a
parcel
of
kids
amount
to
when
it
comes
to
getting
you
a
wife
you
can
call
off
your
hike
ca
you
i
could
but
it
would
be
hard
on
a
good
many
of
them
they
count
on
it
a
good
deal
some
of
them
have
given
up
other
pleasures
they
might
have
had
on
account
of
it
tommy
has
for
instance
his
uncle
asked
him
to
go
to
worcester
with
him
in
his
car
and
he
refused
because
of
his
date
with
me
they
are
all
bribed
to
church
and
sunday
school
by
the
means
one
of
the
things
scouting
stands
for
is
sticking
to
your
job
and
your
word
i
do
think
it
is
exactly
up
to
the
scoutmaster
to
dodge
his
responsibilities
when
he
preaches
the
other
kind
of
thing
of
course
if
it
were
a
life
and
death
matter
it
would
be
different
it
is
i
have
waited
a
good
many
weeks
to
see
carlotta
i
can
wait
one
more
harrison
cressy
grunted
he
hardly
knew
whether
to
fly
into
a
rage
with
this
extraordinary
young
man
or
to
clap
him
on
the
back
and
tell
him
he
liked
him
better
and
better
every
minute
he
contented
himself
by
repeating
a
remark
he
had
made
earlier
in
the
day
you
are
a
darn
fool
young
man
then
he
added
half
against
his
will
but
i
like
your
darnfoolness
hang
me
if
i
do
phil
had
a
strenuous
two
hours
in
the
store
with
never
a
minute
to
get
at
his
father
it
was
not
until
the
last
customer
had
departed
the
last
clerk
fled
away
and
the
clock
striking
eleven
that
the
father
and
son
were
alone
philip
came
over
to
where
the
older
man
stood
his
heart
smote
him
when
he
saw
how
utterly
worn
and
weary
the
other
looked
as
if
he
had
suddenly
added
a
full
ten
years
to
his
age
since
morning
his
characteristic
buoyancy
seemed
to
have
deserted
him
for
once
dad
i
not
had
a
minute
alone
with
you
all
day
i
am
sorry
cressy
bothered
you
about
that
blue
sky
proposition
of
his
i
never
would
have
let
him
if
i
had
known
of
course
there
was
nothing
in
it
i
consider
it
for
a
minute
stuart
lambert
smiled
wearily
and
sat
down
on
the
counter
i
am
afraid
you
have
given
up
more
than
we
realized
philip
in
coming
into
the
store
cressy
gave
me
a
glimpse
into
things
that
i
knew
nothing
about
you
should
have
told
us
there
was
nothing
to
tell
i
given
up
nothing
that
was
mine
i
told
carlotta
all
along
she
would
have
to
come
to
me
i
could
come
to
her
my
whole
life
is
here
with
you
it
is
what
i
have
wanted
ever
since
i
had
the
sense
to
want
anything
but
to
enjoy
my
fool
self
but
even
then
i
did
appreciate
what
it
would
be
like
to
be
here
with
you
i
could
till
i
had
tried
it
and
found
out
first
hand
what
kind
of
a
man
my
dad
was
i
am
absolutely
satisfied
if
cressy
had
offered
me
a
million
a
year
i
would
have
taken
it
it
would
have
been
the
slightest
temptation
even
he
smiled
a
little
sadly
even
with
carlotta
thrown
in
i
do
want
to
get
carlotta
that
way
you
say
you
are
satisfied
philip
maybe
that
is
so
but
you
are
not
happy
i
was
just
at
first
i
was
a
fool
i
let
the
thing
swamp
me
for
awhile
mums
helped
pull
me
out
of
the
slough
and
since
then
i
been
finding
out
that
happiness
is
well
a
kind
of
like
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
does
come
for
observation
i
have
had
about
as
much
happiness
here
with
you
and
with
mums
and
the
girls
at
home
and
with
my
scouts
in
the
woods
as
i
deserve
maybe
more
i
going
to
try
to
get
carlotta
i
have
given
up
hope
i
going
down
to
sea
view
next
week
to
ask
her
again
and
maybe
things
will
be
different
this
time
her
father
is
on
my
side
now
which
is
a
great
help
he
has
got
the
holiday
hill
viewpoint
all
at
once
he
wants
carlotta
to
come
to
me
us
so
do
i
with
all
my
heart
but
whether
she
does
or
does
i
am
here
with
you
as
long
as
you
want
me
first
last
and
all
the
time
and
glad
to
be
please
believe
that
dad
always
stuart
lambert
rose
philip
you
do
know
what
it
means
to
me
to
hear
you
say
this
there
was
a
little
break
in
the
older
man
voice
the
suggestion
of
pent
emotion
it
nearly
killed
me
to
think
i
ought
to
give
you
up
you
are
sure
you
are
not
making
too
much
of
a
sacrifice
dad
please
do
say
that
word
to
me
there
is
any
sacrifice
it
is
what
i
want
i
have
been
a
very
good
son
always
even
this
summer
i
am
afraid
i
have
come
up
to
all
you
expected
of
me
especially
just
at
first
when
i
was
wrapped
up
in
myself
and
my
own
concerns
too
much
to
see
that
doing
a
good
job
in
the
store
was
only
a
small
part
of
what
i
was
here
in
dunbury
to
do
but
anyway
i
am
prouder
than
i
can
tell
you
to
be
your
son
and
i
am
going
to
try
my
darndest
to
live
up
to
the
sign
if
you
will
let
me
stay
on
being
the
minor
part
of
it
he
held
out
his
hand
and
his
father
took
it
there
were
tears
in
the
older
man
eyes
a
moment
later
the
store
was
dark
as
the
two
passed
out
shoulder
to
shoulder
beneath
the
sign
of
stuart
lambert
and
son
chapter
xxii
the
dunbury
cure
harrison
cressy
awoke
next
morning
to
the
cheerful
chirrup
of
robins
and
the
pleasant
sound
of
church
bells
he
liked
the
bells
they
sounded
different
in
the
country
he
thought
you
could
hear
them
in
the
city
anyway
there
were
too
many
noises
to
distract
you
there
was
no
sabbath
stillness
in
the
city
for
that
matter
there
was
much
sabbath
he
got
up
out
of
bed
and
went
and
looked
out
of
the
window
there
was
a
heavenly
hush
everywhere
it
was
still
very
early
it
had
been
the
catholic
bells
ringing
for
mass
that
he
had
heard
the
dew
was
on
every
grass
blade
the
robins
hopped
briskly
about
at
their
business
of
the
morning
glories
all
in
fresh
bloom
climbed
cheerfully
over
the
picket
fence
he
had
seen
a
morning
glory
in
years
it
set
him
dreaming
again
took
him
back
to
his
boyhood
days
if
only
carlotta
would
be
sensible
and
yield
to
the
boy
wooing
dunbury
had
cast
a
kind
of
spell
upon
him
he
wanted
his
daughter
to
live
here
he
wanted
to
come
here
to
visit
her
in
his
imagination
he
saw
himself
coming
to
carlotta
home
not
too
big
a
home
just
big
enough
to
live
and
grow
in
and
raise
babies
in
he
saw
himself
playing
with
little
daughters
and
walking
hand
in
hand
with
her
small
son
harrison
just
such
a
sturdy
youngster
as
philip
lambert
had
no
doubt
been
harrison
cressy
mind
dwelt
fondly
upon
this
grandson
of
his
that
was
a
boy
indeed
carlotta
son
should
not
be
permitted
to
grow
up
a
money
grubber
there
would
be
money
of
course
one
could
very
well
avoid
that
under
the
circumstances
the
boy
would
be
trained
to
the
responsibilities
of
being
harrison
cressy
heir
but
he
should
be
taught
to
see
things
in
their
true
values
and
proportions
he
must
not
grow
up
like
carlotta
he
should
know
that
money
was
good
very
good
but
he
should
know
it
was
not
the
chief
good
was
never
for
an
instant
to
be
classed
with
the
abiding
things
the
real
things
not
to
be
purchased
at
a
price
cressy
sighed
a
little
at
that
point
and
crept
back
to
bed
it
occurred
to
him
he
would
have
to
leave
this
latter
part
of
his
education
to
the
lambert
side
of
the
family
that
was
their
business
just
as
the
money
part
was
his
he
fell
asleep
again
and
presently
in
a
kind
of
shivering
panic
what
if
carlotta
would
not
marry
philip
after
all
what
if
it
was
too
late
already
what
if
his
grandson
turned
out
to
be
a
second
herbert
lathrop
an
unobjectionable
possibly
even
an
objectionable
ass
perspiration
beaded
on
the
millionaire
brow
why
was
that
young
idiot
on
the
hill
waiting
what
were
young
men
made
of
nowadays
did
philip
lambert
know
that
you
could
lose
a
woman
forever
if
you
did
jump
lively
hanged
if
he
would
call
the
boy
this
minute
and
tell
him
he
just
had
to
change
his
mind
and
go
to
crest
house
that
very
morning
without
a
moment
delay
delay
might
be
fatal
harrison
cressy
sat
up
in
bed
fumbled
for
his
slippers
shook
his
head
gloomily
and
returned
to
his
place
under
the
covers
it
was
any
use
he
might
as
well
give
up
he
could
make
philip
lambert
do
anything
he
did
not
want
to
do
he
had
tried
it
twice
and
failed
ignominiously
both
times
he
would
tackle
it
again
the
boy
was
stronger
than
he
was
he
had
to
lie
back
and
let
things
take
their
course
as
best
they
might
cheer
up
cheer
up
counseled
the
robins
outside
but
millionaire
cressy
heeded
not
their
injunctions
the
balloon
of
his
hopes
lay
pricked
and
flat
in
the
dust
he
rose
dressed
breakfasted
and
discovered
there
was
an
eleven
train
for
boston
he
discovered
also
that
he
had
the
slightest
wish
to
take
it
he
did
not
want
to
go
to
boston
he
did
not
want
to
go
to
crest
house
and
very
particularly
and
definitely
he
did
not
want
to
see
his
daughter
carlotta
carlotta
might
ferret
out
his
errand
to
dunbury
and
be
bitterly
angry
at
his
interference
with
her
affairs
even
if
she
were
not
angry
how
could
he
meet
her
without
telling
her
everything
including
things
that
were
the
boy
right
to
tell
it
was
safer
to
stay
away
from
crest
house
entirely
that
was
it
he
would
telegraph
carlotta
his
gout
was
worse
that
he
had
gone
to
the
country
to
take
a
cure
he
would
be
home
saturday
immensely
heartened
he
dispatched
the
wire
by
this
time
it
was
and
the
dew
on
the
grass
was
all
dry
the
morning
glories
shut
tight
and
the
robins
vanished
the
church
bells
were
ringing
again
however
and
harrison
cressy
decided
to
go
to
church
the
white
methodist
church
on
the
common
he
would
meet
any
of
the
hill
people
there
the
holidays
were
episcopal
the
lamberts
unitarian
a
loose
heterodox
kind
of
creed
that
he
wished
phil
were
methodist
it
would
have
given
him
something
to
go
by
then
he
grinned
a
bit
sheepishly
at
his
own
expense
and
shook
his
head
he
had
had
the
methodist
creed
to
go
by
himself
and
much
good
had
it
done
him
maybe
it
did
not
make
so
much
difference
what
you
believed
it
was
how
you
acted
that
mattered
why
that
was
unitarianism
itself
was
it
queer
maybe
there
was
something
in
it
after
all
seated
in
the
little
church
harrison
cressy
hardly
listened
to
the
preacher
droning
voice
he
followed
his
own
trend
of
thought
instead
recalling
scriptural
passages
what
shall
it
profit
a
man
though
he
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
his
own
soul
was
one
of
the
recurring
phrases
he
applied
it
to
philip
lambert
applied
it
sadly
to
himself
and
with
a
shake
of
his
head
to
his
daughter
carlotta
he
remembered
too
the
story
of
the
rich
young
man
had
he
made
carlotta
as
the
rich
young
man
cumbered
her
with
so
many
worldly
possessions
and
standards
that
by
his
own
hand
he
was
keeping
her
out
of
the
heaven
of
happiness
she
might
have
otherwise
inherited
he
feared
so
he
bowed
his
head
with
the
others
but
he
did
not
pray
he
could
not
he
was
too
unhappy
and
yet
who
knows
perhaps
his
unwonted
clarity
of
vision
and
humility
of
soul
were
acceptable
that
morning
in
lieu
of
prayer
to
sandalphou
as
he
ate
his
solitary
dinner
his
despondency
grew
upon
him
he
felt
almost
positive
philip
would
fail
in
his
mission
that
carlotta
would
go
her
willful
way
to
regret
and
disillusionment
and
all
these
things
gone
irretrievably
wrong
would
be
at
bottom
his
own
fault
later
he
endeavored
to
distract
himself
from
his
dreary
thoughts
by
discoursing
with
his
neighbor
on
the
veranda
a
tall
grizzled
soldierly
looking
gentleman
with
shrewd
but
kind
eyes
and
the
brow
of
a
scholar
as
they
talked
desultorily
a
group
of
khaki
clad
youngsters
filed
past
philip
lambert
among
them
looking
only
an
older
and
taller
boy
in
their
midst
the
lads
looked
happy
alert
vigorous
were
of
clean
upstanding
type
the
pick
of
the
town
it
seemed
probable
to
harrison
cressy
who
said
as
much
to
his
companion
the
other
smiled
and
shook
his
head
you
are
mistaken
sir
he
said
three
months
ago
most
of
those
fellows
were
riffraff
the
kind
that
hang
around
street
corners
smoking
and
indulging
in
loose
talk
and
profanity
young
lambert
the
chap
with
them
their
picked
that
kind
from
choice
turned
down
a
respectable
bunch
for
this
one
left
the
other
for
a
man
who
wanted
an
easier
row
to
hoe
it
was
some
stunt
as
the
boys
say
it
took
a
man
like
phil
lambert
to
put
it
through
he
has
the
crowd
where
he
wants
them
now
though
they
would
go
through
fire
and
water
if
he
led
them
and
he
is
a
born
leader
harrison
cressy
eyes
followed
the
departing
group
here
was
a
new
light
on
his
so
he
picked
sinners
to
eat
with
cressy
rather
liked
that
he
hated
snobs
and
pharisees
could
stomach
either
brand
it
means
a
good
deal
to
a
town
like
this
when
its
boys
come
back
and
lend
a
hand
like
that
the
other
man
went
on
so
many
of
them
rush
off
to
the
cities
thinking
there
is
scope
enough
for
their
ineffable
wisdom
and
surpassing
talents
in
their
own
home
town
a
number
of
people
prophesied
that
young
lambert
would
do
the
same
instead
of
settling
down
with
his
father
as
we
all
wanted
him
to
do
i
was
much
afraid
of
that
myself
phil
has
sense
enough
to
see
rather
straight
usually
he
did
about
that
and
then
the
kickers
put
up
a
howl
that
he
had
a
swelled
head
felt
above
the
rest
of
dunbury
because
he
had
a
college
education
and
his
father
was
getting
to
be
one
of
the
most
prosperous
men
in
town
they
complained
he
would
go
in
for
things
the
rest
of
the
town
was
interested
in
kept
to
himself
when
he
was
out
of
the
store
there
were
some
grounds
for
the
kick
i
will
admit
but
it
was
a
month
before
he
got
his
bearings
had
his
head
out
of
the
clouds
and
was
in
the
thick
of
everything
they
swear
by
him
now
almost
as
much
as
they
do
by
his
father
which
is
saying
a
good
deal
for
dunbury
has
revolved
about
stuart
lambert
for
years
it
is
beginning
to
revolve
about
stuart
lambert
and
son
now
but
i
am
boring
you
with
all
this
phil
happens
to
be
rather
a
favorite
of
mine
you
know
him
well
questioned
cressy
i
ought
to
i
am
robert
caldwell
principal
of
the
high
school
here
i
known
phil
since
he
was
in
knickerbockers
and
had
him
under
my
direct
eye
for
four
years
he
kept
my
eye
sufficiently
busy
at
that
he
added
with
a
smile
there
was
much
mischief
that
youngster
and
a
neighbor
of
his
young
ted
holiday
did
get
into
maybe
that
is
why
he
is
such
a
success
with
the
black
sheep
he
added
with
a
nod
in
the
direction
in
which
the
lads
had
gone
observed
cressy
i
am
rather
glad
to
hear
all
this
you
see
it
happens
that
i
came
to
dunbury
to
offer
philip
lambert
a
position
my
name
cressy
harrison
cressy
he
explained
his
companion
lifted
his
a
little
dubiously
i
see
i
did
know
i
was
discussing
a
young
man
you
knew
well
enough
to
offer
a
position
to
may
i
ask
if
he
accepted
it
he
did
not
admitted
harrison
cressy
grimly
turned
it
down
eh
the
school
man
looked
interested
turned
it
down
man
he
made
the
proposition
look
flatter
than
a
last
year
and
it
was
a
mighty
good
proposition
at
least
i
thought
it
was
the
magnate
added
with
a
faint
grin
remembering
all
that
went
with
that
proposition
robert
caldwell
smiled
he
rather
liked
the
idea
of
one
of
his
boys
making
a
proposition
of
millionaire
cressy
look
like
a
last
it
was
what
he
would
have
expected
of
phil
lambert
i
am
sorry
for
you
cressy
he
said
but
i
am
glad
for
dunbury
philip
is
the
kind
we
need
right
here
he
is
the
kind
we
need
right
everywhere
grunted
cressy
only
we
ca
get
they
are
for
sale
no
agreed
robert
caldwell
they
are
not
for
sale
ah
the
boston
train
must
be
in
there
is
the
stage
cressy
allowed
his
eyes
to
stray
idly
to
the
arriving
bus
and
the
descending
passengers
suddenly
he
stiffened
good
lord
he
ejaculated
an
exclamation
called
forth
by
the
fact
that
the
last
person
to
alight
from
the
bus
was
a
slim
young
person
in
a
trim
tailored
navy
blue
suit
and
a
tiny
black
velvet
toque
whose
air
bespoke
paris
a
person
with
eyes
which
were
precisely
the
color
of
violets
which
grow
in
the
deepest
woods
a
little
later
harrison
cressy
sat
in
a
deep
leather
upholstered
chair
in
his
bedroom
with
his
daughter
carlotta
in
his
lap
do
try
to
deceive
me
daddy
darling
carlotta
was
saying
you
were
worried
dreadfully
worried
because
your
little
carlotta
wept
salt
tears
all
over
your
shirt
bosom
you
thought
that
carlotta
must
not
be
allowed
to
be
unhappy
wars
earthquakes
ship
sinkings
wrecks
anything
might
be
allowed
to
go
on
as
usual
but
not
carlotta
unhappy
you
thought
that
did
you
daddy
darling
daddy
darling
pleaded
guilty
of
course
you
did
you
old
dear
the
moment
i
knew
you
were
in
dunbury
i
knew
what
you
were
up
to
i
understand
perfectly
how
your
mind
works
i
ought
to
mine
works
very
much
the
same
way
it
is
a
simple
three
stage
operation
first
we
decide
we
want
a
thing
next
we
decide
the
surest
quickest
way
to
get
it
and
third
we
get
it
at
least
we
usually
do
we
must
do
ourselves
that
much
justice
must
we
not
daddy
darling
daddy
darling
merely
grunted
you
came
to
dunbury
to
tell
phil
he
had
to
marry
me
because
i
was
in
love
with
him
and
wanted
to
marry
him
he
could
very
well
marry
me
and
keep
on
living
in
dunbury
because
i
would
care
to
live
in
dunbury
therefore
he
would
have
to
emigrate
to
a
place
i
would
care
to
live
in
and
he
could
very
well
do
that
unless
he
had
a
very
considerable
income
because
spending
money
was
one
of
my
favorite
sports
both
indoor
and
outdoor
and
i
would
be
happy
if
i
did
keep
right
on
playing
it
to
the
limit
therefore
again
the
very
simple
solution
of
the
whole
thing
was
for
you
to
offer
phil
a
suitable
salary
so
that
we
could
marry
at
once
and
live
in
the
suitable
place
and
say
to
it
bless
you
my
children
bring
on
your
wedding
bells
i
mean
bills
i
foot
put
in
the
rough
that
was
the
plan
was
it
my
dear
parent
practically
admitted
the
dear
parent
with
a
wry
grin
how
did
you
work
it
out
so
accurately
carlotta
made
a
face
at
him
i
worked
it
out
so
accurately
because
it
was
all
old
stuff
the
plan
was
at
all
original
with
you
i
drew
the
first
draft
of
it
myself
last
june
up
on
the
top
of
mount
tom
took
phil
up
there
on
purpose
indeed
to
exhibit
it
to
him
humph
muttered
harrison
cressy
unfortunately
phil
did
at
all
care
for
the
exhibit
because
it
happened
that
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
man
instead
of
a
puppet
i
could
have
told
you
coming
to
dunbury
was
no
earthly
use
if
you
had
consulted
me
phil
did
not
take
to
your
plan
did
he
he
did
not
and
he
told
you
he
did
care
for
me
any
more
carlotta
voice
was
suddenly
a
little
low
he
did
not
in
fact
i
gathered
he
was
fond
of
you
still
in
spite
of
your
abominable
behavior
phil
did
say
i
had
behaved
abominably
daddy
you
know
he
did
he
might
think
it
but
he
would
ever
say
it
not
to
you
anyway
he
did
that
is
my
contribution
and
opinion
carlotta
i
wish
to
the
lord
harry
you
would
marry
philip
lambert
carlotta
lovely
eyes
flashed
surprise
and
delight
before
she
lowered
them
but
daddy
she
said
he
has
got
very
much
money
and
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
money
for
me
you
had
better
learn
to
get
along
with
less
then
snapped
harrison
cressy
i
tell
you
carlotta
money
is
nothing
the
stupidest
most
useless
rottenest
stuff
in
the
world
carlotta
opened
her
eyes
very
wide
is
that
what
you
thought
when
you
came
to
dunbury
she
asked
gravely
no
it
is
what
i
have
learned
to
think
since
i
have
been
in
dunbury
but
you
you
would
want
me
to
live
here
probed
carlotta
my
child
i
would
rather
you
would
live
here
than
any
place
in
the
whole
world
i
traveled
a
million
miles
since
i
saw
you
last
been
back
in
the
past
with
your
mother
things
look
different
to
me
now
i
do
want
what
i
did
for
you
at
least
what
i
want
has
changed
that
is
the
same
always
your
happiness
but
i
have
changed
my
mind
as
to
what
makes
for
happiness
i
am
awfully
glad
daddy
darling
sighed
carlotta
snuggling
closer
in
his
arms
because
i
came
up
here
on
purpose
to
tell
you
that
changed
my
mind
too
if
dunbury
is
good
for
gout
maybe
maybe
it
will
be
good
for
what
ails
me
do
you
think
it
might
daddy
for
answer
he
held
her
very
tight
do
you
mean
it
child
are
you
here
to
tell
that
lad
of
yours
you
are
ready
to
come
up
his
hill
to
him
if
if
he
still
wants
me
faltered
carlotta
i
have
to
find
that
out
for
myself
i
know
as
soon
as
i
see
phil
there
wo
anything
have
to
be
said
i
am
afraid
there
has
been
too
much
talking
already
you
should
have
told
him
i
cried
reproachfully
how
could
i
help
it
that
is
how
the
deuce
did
you
know
i
did
floundered
the
trapped
parent
daddy
you
know
you
played
on
phil
sympathy
every
way
you
could
it
was
awful
at
least
it
would
have
been
awful
if
you
had
bought
him
with
my
silly
tears
after
you
failed
to
buy
him
with
your
silly
money
but
he
did
give
in
even
for
a
moment
even
when
you
told
him
i
cried
did
he
not
even
then
but
that
does
mean
he
does
care
he
but
carlotta
hand
was
over
his
mouth
at
that
how
much
phil
cared
she
wanted
to
hear
from
nobody
but
from
phil
himself
philip
lambert
found
a
queer
message
waiting
for
him
when
he
came
in
from
his
hike
some
mysterious
person
who
would
give
no
name
had
telephoned
requesting
him
to
be
at
the
top
of
sunset
hill
at
precisely
seven
to
hear
some
important
information
which
vitally
concerned
the
firm
of
stuart
lambert
and
son
sounds
like
a
hoax
of
some
sort
remarked
phil
but
lizzie
has
been
chafing
at
the
bit
all
day
in
the
garage
and
i
do
mind
a
ride
come
on
dad
let
see
what
this
bunk
means
stuart
lambert
smiled
assent
and
at
precisely
seven
when
dusk
was
settling
gently
over
the
valley
and
the
glory
in
the
western
sky
was
beginning
to
fade
into
pale
heliotrope
and
rose
tints
lizzie
brought
the
two
lamberts
to
the
crest
of
sunset
hill
where
another
car
waited
a
hired
car
from
the
eagle
garage
from
the
tonneau
of
the
other
car
harrison
cressy
stepped
out
somewhat
ponderously
followed
by
some
one
else
some
one
all
in
white
with
hair
that
shone
pure
gold
even
in
the
gathering
twilight
phil
made
one
leap
and
in
another
moment
before
the
eyes
of
his
father
and
carlotta
not
to
mention
the
interested
stare
of
the
eagle
garage
chauffeur
he
swept
his
princess
into
his
arms
there
was
no
need
of
anybody
trying
to
make
carlotta
see
love
had
opened
her
eyes
the
two
fathers
smiled
at
each
other
both
a
little
glad
and
a
little
sad
brother
lambert
said
cressy
suppose
you
and
i
ride
down
the
hill
i
rather
think
this
spot
belongs
to
the
children
so
it
seems
agreed
stuart
lambert
we
will
leave
lizzie
for
chaperone
i
think
there
will
be
a
moon
later
exactly
there
always
was
a
moon
i
believe
it
is
quite
customary
as
stuart
lambert
got
out
of
the
small
car
philip
and
carlotta
came
to
him
like
happy

a
happy
smile

carlotta
lifting
her
flower
face
to
him
for
a
daughterly
kiss
come

i

in
on
this
deal
where

my

service

and
all
said
phil
holding
out
his
hand
do
rub
it
in
snapped
harrison
cressy
though
he
gripped
the
proffered
hand
hard
come
on
lambert
this
is
no
place
for
us
and
the
two
fathers
went
down
the
hill
in
the
hired
car
leaving
lizzie
and
the
lovers
in
possession
of
the
summit
with
the
world
which
the
moon
was
just
turning
to
silver
at
their
feet
chapter
xxiii
september
changes
when
september
came
carlotta
who
had
been
ostensibly
visiting
tony
though
spending
a
good
deal
of
her
time
in
the
moon
with
phil
as
she
put
it
departed
for
crest
house
carrying
philip
with
her
for
inspection
as
he
dubbed
it
somewhat
ruefully
he
was
particularly
enamored
of
the
prospect
of
being
passed
upon
by
carlotta
friends
and
relatives
it
was
rather
incongruous
when
you
came
to
think
of
it
that
the
lovely
carlotta
who
might
have
married
any
one
in
the
world
should
elect
an
obscure
village
store
keeper
for
a
husband
but
carlotta
herself
had
no
qualms
she
was
shrewd
enough
to
know
that
with
her
father
on
her
side
no
one
would
do
much
disapproving
and
in
any
case
she
had
no
fear
that
any
one
even
just
looking
at
phil
would
question
her
choice
carlotta
was
not
the
woman
to
choose
a
man
she
would
have
to
apologize
for
phil
would
hold
his
own
with
the
best
of
them
and
she
knew
it
he
was
a
man
every
inch
of
him
and
what
more
could
any
woman
ask
ted
went
up
for
his
examinations
and
came
back
so
soberly
that
the
family
held
its
composite
breath
and
wondered
in
secret
whether
he
could
possibly
have
failed
after
all
his
really
heroic
effort
but
presently
the
word
came
that
he
had
not
only
not
failed
but
had
rather
covered
himself
with
glory
the
dean
himself
an
old
friend
of
doctor
holiday
wrote
expressing
his
congratulations
and
the
hope
that
this
performance
of
his
nephew
was
a
pledge
of
better
things
in
the
future
and
that
this
fourth
holiday
to
pass
through
the
college
might
yet
reflect
credit
upon
it
and
the
holiday
name
ted
himself
emphatically
disclaimed
all
praise
whatsoever
in
the
matter
and
cut
short
his
uncle
attempt
at
expressing
his
appreciation
not
only
of
the
successful
finish
of
the
examinations
but
the
whole
summer
hard
work
and
steadiness
i
am
glad
if
you
are
satisfied
uncle
phil
he
said
but
there
any
credit
coming
to
me
it
was
the
least
i
could
do
after
making
such
a
confounded
mess
of
things
let
forget
it
but
ted
holiday
was
not
quite
the
same
unthinking
young
barbarian
in
september
that
he
had
been
in
june
nobody
could
work
as
he
had
worked
that
summer
without
gaining
something
in
character
and
moreover
being
constantly
as
he
was
with
his
brother
and
uncle
he
would
have
been
duller
than
he
was
not
to
get
a
hunch
as
he
would
have
called
it
of
what
it
meant
to
be
a
holiday
of
the
authentic
sort
larry
example
was
particularly
salutary
the
younger
holiday
could
not
help
comparing
his
own
irresponsibility
of
conduct
with
the
older
one
quiet
and
firmness
of
principle
love
for
ruth
was
the
real
thing
ted
could
see
that
and
it
made
his
own
random
attraction
to
madeline
taylor
look
crude
and
cheap
if
nothing
worse
he
hated
to
remember
that
affair
in
cousin
emma
garden
he
made
up
his
mind
there
would
be
no
more
things
like
that
to
have
to
remember
you
can
tell
old
bob
caldwell
he
wrote
from
college
to
his
uncle
that
he
sport
no
more
caddies
and
golf
balls
at
my
expense
flunking
is
too
damned
expensive
every
way
saving
your
presence
uncle
phil
no
more
of
it
for
this
child
but
do
get
it
into
your
head
i
am
a
violently
reformed
character
i
am
nothing
of
the
kind
and
do
want
to
be
if
i
see
any
signs
of
angel
cropping
out
i
shave
i
hate
to
be
conspicuously
virtuous
all
the
same
if
i
have
a
few
grains
more
sense
than
i
had
last
year
they
are
mostly
to
your
credit
fact
is
uncle
phil
you
are
a
peach
and
i
am
just
beginning
to
realize
it
more
fool
i
tony
also
flitted
from
the
hill
that
september
for
her
new
work
and
life
in
the
big
city
rather
against
her
will
she
had
ensconced
herself
in
a
student
hostelry
where
jean
lambert
phil
older
sister
had
been
living
several
years
very
happily
first
as
a
student
and
later
as
a
successful
illustrator
tony
had
objected
that
she
did
not
want
anything
so
schooly
and
that
the
very
fact
that
jean
liked
the
hostelry
would
be
proof
positive
that
she
tony
would
not
like
it
what
she
really
wanted
to
do
was
either
to
have
a
studio
of
her
own
or
accept
félice
invitation
to
make
her
home
with
her
norman
was
a
cousin
of
mother
a
charming
widow
of
wealth
and
wide
social
connections
whom
tony
had
always
adored
and
admired
extravagantly
just
visiting
her
had
always
been
like
taking
a
trip
to
fairy
land
and
to
live
with
her
well
it
would
be
just
too
wonderful
tony
thought
but
doctor
holiday
had
vetoed
decidedly
both
these
pleasant
and
impractical
propositions
tony
was
far
too
young
and
pretty
to
live
alone
that
was
out
of
the
question
and
he
was
scarcely
more
willing
that
she
should
go
to
norman
though
he
liked
the
latter
very
well
and
was
glad
that
his
niece
would
have
her
to
go
to
in
any
emergency
he
knew
tony
and
knew
that
in
such
an
environment
as
norman
home
offered
the
girl
would
all
but
inevitably
drift
into
being
a
gay
little
social
butterfly
and
forget
she
ever
came
to
the
city
to
do
serious
work
life
with
norman
would
be
too
wonderful
indeed
so
tony
went
to
the
hostelry
with
the
understanding
that
if
after
a
few
months
trial
she
really
did
dislike
it
as
much
as
she
declared
she
knew
she
would
they
would
make
other
arrangements
but
rather
to
her
chagrin
she
found
herself
liking
the
place
very
much
and
enjoying
the
society
of
the
other
girls
who
were
all
in
the
city
as
she
and
jean
were
pursuing
some
art
or
other
the
dramatic
school
work
was
all
she
had
hoped
and
more
stimulating
engrossing
altogether
delightful
she
made
friends
easily
as
always
among
teachers
and
pupils
slipped
naturally
here
as
in
college
into
a
position
of
leadership
tony
holiday
was
a
born
queen
she
had
plenty
of
outside
diversion
too
cousin
félice
was
kind
and
delighted
to
pet
and
exhibit
her
pretty
little
kinswoman
there
were
fascinating
glimpses
into
high
society
delightful
private
dancing
parties
in
gorgeous
ball
rooms
motor
trips
gay
theater
parties
in
resplendent
boxes
followed
by
suppers
in
brilliant
restaurants
all
the
pomp
and
glitter
of
life
that
youth
loves
there
were
other
no
less
genuinely
happy
occasions
spent
with
dick
carson
way
up
near
the
roof
in
the
theaters
and
opera
house
or
in
queer
fascinating
foreign
restaurants
the
two
had
the
jolliest
kind
of
time
together
always
like
two
children
at
a
picnic
tony
was
very
nice
to
dick
these
days
he
kept
her
from
being
too
homesick
for
the
hill
and
anyway
she
felt
a
wee
bit
sorry
for
him
because
he
did
not
know
about
alan
and
those
long
letters
which
came
so
frequently
from
the
retreat
in
the
mountains
where
the
latter
was
sketching
she
knew
she
ought
to
tell
dick
how
far
things
had
gone
but
somehow
she
could
quite
drive
herself
to
do
it
she
did
want
to
hurt
him
and
she
did
not
want
to
banish
him
from
her
life
she
wanted
him
needed
him
just
where
he
was
at
her
feet
and
never
bothering
her
with
any
inconvenient
demands
or
it
was
selfish
but
it
was
true
and
in
any
case
it
would
be
soon
enough
to
worry
dick
when
alan
came
back
to
town
and
then
without
warning
he
was
back
very
much
back
and
with
his
return
the
pleasant
nicely
balanced
casual
scheme
of
things
which
she
had
been
following
so
contentedly
was
knocked
sky
high
she
had
to
adjust
herself
to
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
with
alan
massey
the
center
of
both
in
her
delight
and
intoxication
at
having
her
lover
near
her
again
more
fascinating
and
than
ever
tony
lost
her
head
a
little
neglected
her
work
snubbed
her
friends
refused
invitations
from
dick
and
cousin
félice
and
indeed
from
everybody
except
alan
she
went
everywhere
with
him
almost
nowhere
without
him
spent
her
days
and
more
of
her
nights
than
was
at
all
prudent
or
proper
in
his
absorbing
society
had
in
short
what
she
afterward
described
to
carlotta
as
a
perfect
orgy
of
alan
at
the
end
of
ten
days
she
called
a
halt
sat
down
and
took
honest
account
of
herself
and
her
proceedings
and
found
that
this
sort
of
thing
would
not
do
alan
was
too
expensive
every
way
she
could
not
afford
so
much
of
him
accordingly
with
her
usual
decision
and
frankness
she
explained
the
situation
to
him
as
she
saw
it
and
announced
that
henceforth
she
would
see
him
only
twice
a
week
and
not
as
often
if
she
were
especially
busy
to
this
ultimatum
she
kept
rigidly
in
spite
of
her
lover
protests
and
pleas
and
threats
she
was
inexorable
if
alan
wanted
to
see
her
at
all
he
must
do
it
on
her
terms
he
yielded
perforce
and
was
madder
over
her
than
ever
fêted
and
worshiped
and
adored
her
inordinately
when
he
was
with
her
deluged
her
with
flowers
and
poetry
and
letters
between
times
called
her
up
daily
and
nightly
by
telephone
just
to
hear
her
voice
if
he
might
not
see
her
face
so
superficially
tony
conquered
but
she
was
not
of
her
victory
she
knew
that
whether
she
saw
alan
or
not
he
was
always
in
the
of
her
thoughts
and
feelings
in
the
midst
of
other
occupations
she
caught
herself
wondering
whether
he
had
written
her
whether
she
would
find
his
flowers
when
she
got
home
where
he
was
what
he
was
doing
if
he
was
thinking
of
her
as
she
of
him
she
wanted
him
most
irrationally
when
she
forbade
his
coming
to
her
she
looked
forward
to
those
few
hours
spent
with
him
as
the
only
time
when
she
was
fully
alive
dreamed
them
over
afterward
knew
they
meant
a
hundredfold
more
to
her
than
those
she
spent
with
any
other
man
or
woman
she
wore
his
flowers
pored
over
his
long
beautiful
impassioned
letters
devoured
the
books
of
poetry
he
sent
her
danced
with
him
as
often
and
as
long
as
she
dared
gave
her
soul
more
and
more
into
his
keeping
the
more
so
perhaps
in
that
he
was
so
tenderly
reverential
of
her
body
never
even
touching
her
lips
with
his
though
his
eyes
often
told
a
less
moderate
story
the
orgy
over
she
was
again
doing
well
with
her
work
at
the
school
she
knew
that
her
teachers
praised
her
gifts
and
her
progress
without
any
vanity
she
could
not
help
seeing
that
she
was
forging
ahead
of
others
who
had
started
even
with
her
had
more
real
talent
perhaps
than
most
of
those
with
whom
she
worked
and
played
but
she
took
no
pride
in
these
things
for
equally
clearly
she
saw
that
she
was
not
doing
half
what
she
might
have
done
would
have
done
had
there
been
no
alan
massey
in
the
city
and
in
her
heart
she
had
a
divided
allegiance
and
a
divided
allegiance
is
a
hard
thing
to
live
with
as
a
daily
companion
but
she
would
not
have
had
it
otherwise
not
for
a
moment
did
she
ever
wish
to
go
back
to
those
free
days
when
love
was
but
a
name
and
the
flame
had
not
blown
so
dangerously
near
as
for
alan
massey
himself
he
alternated
between
moods
which
were
starry
pinnacles
of
ecstasy
and
others
which
were
bottomless
pits
of
despair
he
lived
for
two
things
only
his
hours
with
tony
and
his
work
for
he
had
begun
to
paint
again
magnificently
furiously
with
all
his
old
power
and
a
new
almost
godlike
one
added
to
it
as
an
artist
it
was
his
supreme
hour
he
painted
as
he
had
never
painted
before
his
love
for
tony
ran
the
whole
gamut
he
loved
her
passionately
found
it
exquisite
torture
to
have
her
in
his
arms
when
they
danced
and
to
have
still
to
bank
the
fires
which
consumed
him
and
of
which
she
only
dimly
guessed
he
loved
her
humbly
worshipfully
as
a
moth
might
look
to
a
star
he
loved
her
tenderly
protectingly
longed
to
shield
her
by
his
own
might
from
all
griefs
troubles
and
petty
annoyances
to
guard
her
day
and
night
lest
any
rough
unlovely
or
unseemly
thing
press
near
her
shining
sphere
he
desired
to
wrap
her
about
with
a
magic
mantle
of
beauty
and
luxury
and
the
quintessence
of
life
to
keep
her
in
a
place
apart
as
he
kept
his
priceless
collection
of
rubies
and
emeralds
he
loved
her
jealously
was
sick
at
the
thought
that
some
other
man
might
be
near
her
when
he
might
not
might
dance
with
her
covet
her
kiss
her
he
hated
all
men
because
of
her
and
particularly
he
hated
with
black
hate
the
man
whom
he
was
wronging
daily
by
his
silence
his
cousin
john
massey
beneath
all
this
strange
sad
welter
of
emotion
deeper
still
in
alan
massey
heart
lay
the
tragic
conviction
that
he
would
never
win
tony
that
his
own
sins
would
somehow
rise
to
strike
at
him
like
a
snake
out
of
the
grass
he
had
lost
faith
in
his
luck
had
lost
it
strangely
enough
when
luck
had
laid
at
his
feet
that
most
desirable
of
all
gifts
jim
roberts
timely
death
in
the
house
on
the
hill
things
were
very
quiet
missing
the
gay
presence
of
the
two
younger
holidays
and
with
those
at
home
cumbered
with
cares
and
perplexity
and
grief
things
were
easier
for
ruth
than
for
larry
it
was
less
difficult
for
her
to
play
the
part
of
quiet
friendship
than
for
him
partly
because
her
love
was
a
much
less
tempestuous
affair
and
partly
because
a
woman
nearly
always
plays
a
part
of
any
kind
with
more
facility
than
a
man
does
and
larry
holiday
was
temperamentally
unfit
to
play
any
part
whatsoever
he
was
a
and
person
the
simplicity
of
the
girl
role
was
also
very
largely
created
by
her
lover
rigid
self
control
she
took
her
cue
from
his
quietness
and
felt
that
things
could
not
be
so
bad
after
all
at
least
they
were
together
neither
had
driven
the
other
away
from
the
hill
by
any
unconsidered
act
or
word
ruth
had
no
idea
that
being
with
her
under
the
tormenting
circumstances
was
scarcely
undivided
happiness
for
poor
larry
or
that
her
peace
of
mind
was
more
or
less
purchased
at
cost
of
his
larry
kept
the
promise
he
had
made
to
his
uncle
more
literally
than
the
latter
had
had
any
idea
he
would
or
could
he
never
sought
out
society
was
never
alone
with
her
if
he
could
help
it
never
so
much
as
touched
her
hand
ruth
being
a
very
human
and
feminine
little
person
sometimes
wished
he
were
not
quite
so
consistently
holidayish
in
his
conduct
she
missed
the
ardent
gaze
of
those
wonderful
gray
eyes
which
he
now
kept
studiously
averted
from
hers
privately
she
thought
it
would
not
have
mattered
so
fearfully
if
just
once
in
a
while
he
had
forgotten
the
ring
life
was
very
very
drab
when
you
never
forgot
and
let
yourself
go
the
tiniest
little
bit
child
like
little
ruth
never
guessed
that
a
man
like
larry
holiday
does
not
dare
let
himself
go
the
tiniest
little
bit
lest
he
go
farther
far
enough
to
regret
doctor
holiday
watching
in
silence
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
understood
better
what
was
going
on
behind
his
nephew
quiet
exterior
demeanor
and
wondered
sometimes
if
it
had
not
been
a
mistake
to
keep
the
boy
bound
to
the
wheel
like
that
if
he
should
not
rather
have
packed
him
off
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
far
away
from
the
little
lady
with
the
wedding
ring
who
was
so
little
married
and
yet
there
was
granny
growing
perceptibly
weaker
day
by
day
clinging
pathetically
to
larry
young
strength
poor
granny
and
poor
larry
how
little
one
could
do
for
either
ruth
memory
did
not
return
she
remembered
or
at
least
found
familiar
books
she
had
read
songs
she
must
have
sung
drifted
into
doing
a
hundred
little
simple
everyday
things
she
must
have
done
before
since
they
came
to
her
with
no
effort
she
could
sew
and
knit
and
play
the
piano
exquisitely
but
all
this
seemed
rather
a
trick
of
the
fingers
than
of
the
mind
the
people
the
places
the
life
that
lay
behind
that
crash
on
the
overland
never
returned
to
her
consciousness
for
all
her
anxious
struggle
to
get
them
back
it
began
to
look
as
if
her
husband
if
she
had
one
were
not
going
to
claim
her
no
one
claimed
her
not
a
single
response
came
from
all
the
extensive
advertising
which
larry
still
kept
up
in
vain
hope
of
success
apparently
no
one
had
missed
the
little
goldilocks
precious
as
she
was
none
sought
her
in
the
meanwhile
she
was
an
undisguised
angel
visitant
to
the
house
on
the
hill
if
in
his
kindly
hospitality
doctor
holiday
had
stretched
a
point
or
two
in
the
first
place
to
make
the
little
stranger
feel
at
home
the
case
was
different
now
she
was
needed
badly
needed
and
she
played
the
part
of
house
daughter
so
sweetly
and
unselfishly
that
her
presence
among
them
was
a
double
blessing
to
them
all
except
perhaps
to
poor
larry
who
loved
her
best
of
all
chapter
xxiv
a
past
which
did
not
stay
buried
coming
in
from
a
lively
game
of
tennis
with
elsie
hathaway
his
newest
sweetheart
the
ancient
history
prof
pretty
daughter
ted
holiday
found
awaiting
him
a
letter
from
madeline
taylor
he
turned
it
over
in
his
hands
with
a
keen
distaste
for
opening
it
had
indeed
almost
a
mind
to
chuck
it
in
the
waste
paper
basket
unread
hang
it
all
why
had
she
written
he
did
want
to
hear
from
her
did
want
to
be
reminded
of
her
existence
he
wanted
instead
distinctly
to
forget
there
was
a
madeline
taylor
and
that
he
had
been
fool
enough
to
make
love
to
her
once
nevertheless
he
opened
the
letter
and
pulled
his
forelock
in
perturbation
as
he
read
it
she
had
quarrelled
with
her
grandfather
and
he
would
not
let
her
come
back
home
she
was
with
emma
just
now
but
she
could
stay
fred
was
behaving
very
nastily
and
he
might
tell
emma
any
day
that
she
madeline
had
to
go
they
were
all
against
her
everything
was
against
a
girl
anyway
they
never
had
a
chance
as
a
man
did
she
wished
she
had
been
killed
when
she
had
been
thrown
out
of
the
car
that
night
it
would
have
been
much
better
for
her
than
being
as
miserable
as
she
was
now
she
often
wished
she
was
dead
but
what
she
had
written
to
ted
holiday
for
was
because
she
thought
perhaps
he
could
help
her
to
find
a
job
in
the
college
town
she
had
to
earn
some
money
right
away
she
would
do
anything
she
did
care
what
and
would
be
very
grateful
to
ted
if
he
would
or
could
help
her
to
find
work
that
was
all
there
was
not
a
single
personal
note
in
the
whole
thing
no
reference
to
their
flirtation
of
the
early
summer
except
the
one
allusion
to
the
accident
no
attempt
to
revive
such
frail
ties
as
had
existed
between
them
no
reproaches
to
ted
for
having
broken
these
off
so
summarily
it
was
simply
and
exclusively
a
plea
for
help
from
one
human
being
to
another
ted
thrust
the
letter
soberly
in
his
pocket
and
went
off
for
a
shower
but
the
thing
went
with
him
he
wished
madeline
had
written
wished
she
had
besought
his
aid
wished
most
of
all
she
had
been
such
a
devilish
good
sport
in
it
all
if
she
had
whined
cast
things
up
against
him
as
she
might
have
done
thrown
herself
in
any
way
upon
him
he
could
perhaps
have
ignored
her
and
her
plea
but
she
had
done
nothing
of
the
sort
she
was
deucedly
game
now
just
as
she
had
been
the
night
of
the
smash
and
by
a
queer
trick
of
his
mind
her
very
gameness
made
ted
holiday
feel
more
quiet
and
responsible
a
frame
of
mind
he
heartily
resented
hanged
if
he
could
see
why
it
was
his
funeral
if
that
old
hottentot
of
a
grandfather
of
hers
chose
to
turn
her
out
without
a
cent
it
was
his
fault
for
that
matter
he
was
to
blame
for
what
madeline
herself
had
done
he
did
suppose
the
old
man
would
have
cut
so
rough
without
plenty
of
cause
why
did
she
have
to
bob
up
now
and
make
him
feel
so
darned
rotten
unfortunately
even
the
briefest
of
episodes
have
a
way
of
not
erasing
themselves
as
conveniently
as
most
of
us
would
like
to
have
them
the
thing
was
there
and
ted
holiday
had
to
look
at
it
whether
it
made
him
feel
darned
rotten
or
not
he
did
not
want
to
help
the
girl
did
not
even
want
to
renew
their
acquaintance
by
even
so
much
as
a
letter
the
whole
thing
was
an
infernal
nuisance
but
infernal
nuisance
or
not
he
had
to
deal
with
it
could
not
funk
it
he
was
a
holiday
and
no
holiday
ever
shirked
obligations
he
himself
had
incurred
he
was
a
holiday
and
no
holiday
ever
let
a
woman
ask
for
help
and
not
give
it
by
the
time
he
was
back
from
the
shower
ted
knew
precisely
where
he
stood
perhaps
he
had
known
all
along
the
next
day
he
bestirred
himself
went
to
berry
the
florist
who
he
happened
to
know
was
in
need
of
a
clerk
got
the
burly
irishman
consent
to
give
the
girl
a
job
at
excellent
wages
right
away
the
sooner
the
better
ted
opened
his
mouth
to
ask
for
an
advance
of
salary
but
thought
better
of
it
before
the
words
came
out
madeline
might
not
like
to
have
anybody
know
she
was
up
against
it
like
that
he
would
have
to
see
to
that
part
of
it
himself
somehow
you
a
good
customer
holiday
the
genial
florist
was
saying
i
tickled
to
be
obligin
ye
and
mesilf
at
the
same
time
anything
in
the
flower
line
holiday
some
roses
now
or
violets
got
some
jim
dandies
just
in
beauties
i
tellin
you
want
to
see
ted
hesitated
his
exchecquer
was
low
very
low
the
first
of
the
month
was
also
far
away
too
far
considering
all
things
his
bill
at
already
passed
the
bounds
of
wisdom
and
the
possibility
of
being
paid
in
full
out
of
the
next
month
allowance
without
horribly
crippling
the
debtor
it
was
exceedingly
annoying
to
have
to
forfeit
that
ten
dollars
to
uncle
phil
every
month
for
that
darned
automobile
business
which
it
seemed
as
if
he
never
would
get
free
of
one
way
or
another
he
certainly
ought
not
to
buy
any
more
flowers
this
month
still
there
was
the
hop
elsie
was
going
with
him
he
had
run
a
race
with
three
other
applicants
for
the
privilege
of
escorting
her
and
being
victor
it
behooved
him
to
prove
he
appreciated
his
gains
he
want
elsie
to
think
he
was
a
or
worse
still
suspect
him
of
being
broke
he
fell
let
berry
open
the
show
case
debated
seriously
the
respective
merits
of
roses
and
violets
having
reluctantly
relinquished
orchids
as
a
little
too
ruinous
even
for
a
ruined
young
man
if
they
are
for
miss
hathaway
murmured
a
pretty
sympathetic
clerk
in
his
ear
delany
sent
roses
this
morning
and
she
likes
violets
best
i
heard
her
say
so
that
settled
it
ted
holiday
was
going
to
be
beaten
by
a
poor
fish
like
ned
delany
the
violets
were
bought
and
duly
charged
along
with
those
other
too
numerous
items
on
ted
holiday
account
going
home
ted
wrote
a
cheerful
friendly
letter
to
madeline
taylor
reporting
his
success
in
getting
her
a
job
and
enclosing
a
check
for
twenty
live
dollars
just
to
tide
you
over
he
had
put
in
lightly
forbearing
to
mention
that
the
gift
made
his
bank
balance
even
lighter
so
light
in
fact
that
it
approached
complete
invisibility
he
added
that
he
was
sorry
things
were
in
a
mess
for
her
but
they
would
clear
up
soon
bound
to
you
know
and
nix
on
the
it
was
really
a
jolly
old
world
as
she
would
say
herself
when
her
luck
turned
he
remained
hers
sincerely
and
so
forth
this
business
off
his
mind
young
holiday
felt
highly
relieved
and
pleased
with
himself
and
the
world
which
was
such
a
jolly
old
affair
as
he
had
just
assured
madeline
later
he
went
to
the
hop
and
had
a
corking
time
stayed
till
the
last
violin
swooned
off
into
silence
then
sauntered
with
deliberate
leisureliness
toward
hathaway
house
with
elsie
on
his
arm
on
the
prof
porch
he
had
lingered
as
long
as
was
prudent
perhaps
a
little
longer
spooning
discreetly
the
while
as
one
may
even
with
an
ancient
history
prof
daughter
there
was
nothing
suggestive
of
ancient
history
about
elsie
she
was
slim
and
young
as
the
little
new
moon
they
had
both
nearly
broken
their
necks
to
see
over
their
right
shoulders
a
few
minutes
before
moreover
she
was
exceedingly
pretty
and
as
provocative
as
the
dickens
in
the
end
ted
stole
a
saucy
kiss
and
left
her
pretending
to
be
as
indignant
as
if
a
dozen
other
impudent
youths
had
not
done
precisely
the
same
thing
since
the
opening
of
the
college
year
it
was
the
lady
privilege
to
protest
ted
granted
that
but
neither
was
he
much
taken
in
by
injured
innocence
airs
elsie
was
quite
as
sophisticated
as
he
was
himself
as
he
knew
very
well
no
first
kiss
business
for
either
of
them
he
reflected
as
he
went
whistling
back
to
the
frat
house
it
was
all
in
the
game
and
both
knew
it
was
nothing
but
a
game
which
made
it
perfectly
pleasant
and
harmless
at
the
frat
house
he
found
a
quiet
little
game
of
another
sort
in
progress
slid
in
took
a
hand
got
interested
played
until
three
and
on
quitting
found
himself
in
possession
of
some
thirty
odd
dollars
he
had
not
had
when
he
sat
in
considering
his
recent
financial
depression
the
thirty
dollars
was
all
to
the
good
covered
madeline
check
and
elsie
violets
it
was
indeed
a
jolly
old
world
if
you
treated
it
right
and
did
not
take
it
or
yourself
too
seriously
inasmuch
as
playing
cards
for
money
was
strictly
against
college
rules
and
gambling
had
been
the
one
vice
of
all
vices
the
late
major
holiday
had
hated
with
unrelenting
hate
it
might
be
a
satisfaction
to
record
that
the
late
major
son
took
an
uneasy
conscience
to
bed
that
night
or
rather
that
morning
but
truth
is
truth
and
we
are
compelled
to
state
that
ted
holiday
did
not
suffer
the
faintest
twinge
of
remorse
and
went
to
sleep
the
moment
his
head
touched
the
pillow
as
peacefully
as
a
guileless
new
born
babe
might
have
done
moreover
when
he
woke
the
next
morning
at
an
unconscionably
late
hour
he
turned
over
looked
at
the
clock
grunted
and
grinned
sleepily
and
lapsed
off
again
into
blissful
oblivion
thereby
cutting
all
his
morning
classes
and
generally
submerging
himself
in
the
unregenerate
ways
of
his
graceless
sophomoric
year
he
had
never
contracted
to
be
conspicuously
virtuous
it
will
be
recalled
the
next
day
he
secured
a
suitable
lodging
place
for
madeline
in
an
inexpensive
but
respectable
neighborhood
and
the
day
after
that
betook
himself
to
the
station
to
meet
the
girl
herself
ted
never
did
things
by
halves
having
made
up
his
mind
to
stand
by
he
did
it
thoroughly
perhaps
the
more
punctiliously
because
in
his
heart
he
loathed
the
whole
business
and
wished
he
were
well
out
of
it
for
a
moment
as
madeline
came
toward
him
he
hardly
recognized
her
she
looked
years
older
the
brilliancy
of
her
beauty
was
curiously
dimmed
as
an
electric
light
might
be
dimmed
inside
a
dusty
globe
there
were
hard
lines
about
her
full
lips
and
a
sharp
driven
look
in
her
black
eyes
the
two
had
met
in
june
on
equal
terms
of
blithe
youth
now
only
a
few
months
later
ted
was
still
a
careless
boy
but
madeline
taylor
had
been
forced
into
premature
womanhood
and
wore
on
her
haggard
young
face
the
stamp
of
a
woman
hard
won
wisdom
to
the
girl
ted
holiday
appeared
more
the
bonny
prince
charming
than
ever
only
infinitely
farther
removed
from
her
than
he
had
seemed
in
those
happy
summer
days
which
were
a
million
years
ago
to
all
intents
and
purposes
now
how
good
looking
he
was
how
tall
and
clean
and
manly
looking
her
heart
gave
a
quick
jump
seeing
him
again
after
all
these
dreary
months
but
oh
she
must
be
very
careful
must
never
forget
for
a
moment
that
things
were
very
very
different
now
from
what
they
were
in
june
there
was
a
moment
slightly
embarrassed
silence
as
they
shook
hands
both
were
remembering
all
too
vividly
the
scene
in
cousin
emma
garden
upon
the
occasion
of
their
last
meeting
it
was
ted
who
first
found
tongue
and
announced
casually
that
he
was
going
to
take
her
straight
to
the
house
of
bascom
her
landlady
to
be
she
a
good
sort
he
added
mothery
like
you
know
you
like
her
madeline
did
not
answer
she
could
something
choked
in
her
throat
the
phrase
mothery
like
was
almost
too
much
for
the
girl
who
had
never
had
a
mother
to
remember
and
wanted
one
now
as
she
never
had
wanted
one
in
her
life
ted
kindness
the
first
she
had
received
from
any
one
these
many
days
touched
her
deeply
for
the
first
time
in
months
the
tears
brimmed
up
into
her
eyes
as
she
followed
her
companion
to
the
cab
and
let
him
help
her
in
as
the
door
closed
upon
them
ted
turned
and
faced
the
girl
and
seeing
the
tears
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
hers
gently
do
worry
madeline
he
said
things
are
going
to
look
up
and
please
do
cry
he
pleaded
earnestly
she
wiped
away
the
tears
and
summoned
a
wan
little
smile
to
meet
his
i
wo
she
said
crying
is
silly
and
wo
help
anything
it
is
just
that
i
was
awfully
tired
and
your
being
so
good
to
me
upset
me
always
been
good
even
when
i
thought
you
were
i
understand
better
now
and
oh
ted
you
do
know
how
ashamed
i
am
of
the
way
i
behaved
that
night
it
was
awful
my
striking
you
like
that
it
made
me
sick
to
think
of
it
afterward
it
need
have
if
anybody
has
any
call
to
be
ashamed
of
that
night
it
yours
truly
see
here
madeline
i
worried
a
lot
about
you
though
maybe
you
wo
believe
it
because
i
did
write
or
act
as
if
i
were
sorry
about
things
i
kept
still
because
it
seemed
the
straightest
thing
to
do
all
round
but
i
did
think
a
great
deal
about
you
honest
i
did
and
i
wondered
millions
of
times
if
my
set
things
going
wrong
for
you
did
it
madeline
he
demanded
no
she
answered
her
gaze
away
from
his
out
the
cab
window
you
must
worry
ted
or
blame
yourself
it
it
all
my
fault
everything
it
good
of
you
to
let
me
out
but
i
am
not
so
sure
i
ought
to
be
let
out
i
give
a
good
deal
this
minute
if
i
could
go
back
and
not
take
uncle
phil
car
that
night
ted
leaned
forward
suddenly
and
for
a
startled
instant
madeline
thought
he
meant
to
kiss
her
but
nothing
was
farther
from
his
wish
or
thought
it
was
the
scar
he
was
looking
for
he
had
almost
forgotten
it
just
as
he
had
almost
forgotten
the
episode
it
represented
but
there
it
was
on
her
forehead
even
in
the
gathering
darkness
it
showed
with
perfect
distinctness
i
hoped
it
had
gone
he
added
but
it
is
still
there
is
it
the
scar
yes
it
is
still
there
for
a
moment
the
ghost
of
a
smile
played
about
the
girl
lips
i
always
liked
it
i
miss
it
if
it
went
well
i
do
like
it
i
hate
it
groaned
the
boy
why
madeline
i
might
have
killed
you
i
know
sometimes
i
wish
it
had
come
out
so
it
it
would
have
been
better
do
madeline
that
is
an
awful
thing
to
say
things
ca
be
as
bad
as
all
that
you
know
they
ca
by
the
way
can
you
tell
me
the
whole
business
or
would
you
rather
not
the
girl
shivered
no
do
ask
me
ted
it
it
too
awful
do
bother
about
me
you
have
done
quite
enough
as
it
is
i
am
very
grateful
but
truly
i
would
rather
you
would
have
anything
more
to
do
with
me
just
forget
i
am
here
and
because
this
injunction
was
precisely
in
line
with
his
own
inclination
ted
suspected
its
propriety
and
swung
counterwise
in
true
ted
fashion
i
do
just
exactly
as
i
please
about
that
i
wo
pester
you
but
you
need
think
i
going
to
leave
you
all
soul
alone
in
a
strange
place
when
you
are
feeling
rotten
anyway
i
pretty
doggoned
selfish
but
not
quite
that
bad
chapter
xxv
all
the
world
a
stage
although
max
hempel
had
not
openly
sought
out
tony
holiday
he
was
entirely
aware
of
her
presence
in
the
city
and
in
the
dramatic
school
whenever
she
played
a
role
in
the
course
of
the
latter
program
he
had
his
trusted
aides
on
the
spot
to
watch
her
gauge
her
progress
report
their
finding
to
himself
once
or
twice
he
had
come
himself
sat
in
a
dark
corner
and
kept
his
eye
unblinking
from
first
to
last
upon
the
girl
in
november
it
had
seemed
good
to
the
school
to
revive
the
killarney
rose
a
play
which
ten
years
ago
had
had
a
phenomenal
run
and
ended
as
it
began
with
packed
houses
it
was
past
history
now
even
the
road
companies
had
lapsed
and
its
name
was
all
but
forgotten
by
the
fickle
public
which
must
and
will
have
ever
new
sensations
hempel
was
glad
the
school
had
made
this
particular
selection
doubly
glad
it
had
given
antoinette
holiday
the
title
role
the
play
would
show
whether
the
girl
was
ready
for
his
purposes
as
he
had
about
decided
she
was
he
would
send
carol
clay
to
see
her
do
the
thing
carol
would
know
who
better
it
was
she
who
created
the
original
rose
tony
holiday
behind
the
scene
on
that
momentous
evening
on
being
informed
that
carol
clay
the
famous
carol
clay
herself
the
real
rose
was
out
there
in
a
box
was
paralyzed
with
fear
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
victim
of
genuine
stage
fright
she
was
cold
she
was
hot
she
was
one
tremendous
shake
and
shiver
she
was
a
very
lump
of
stone
the
orchestra
was
already
playing
in
a
moment
her
call
would
come
and
she
was
going
to
fail
fail
miserably
and
with
carol
clay
there
to
see
some
flowers
and
a
card
were
brought
in
the
flowers
were
from
alan
of
course
great
crimson
roses
it
was
dear
of
him
to
send
them
later
she
would
appreciate
it
but
just
now
not
even
alan
mattered
she
glanced
at
the
card
which
had
come
separately
was
not
with
the
flowers
it
was
dick
hastily
she
read
the
scrawl
am
covering
the
rose
will
be
close
up
see
you
after
the
show
best
o
luck
and
love
tony
could
almost
have
cried
for
joy
over
the
message
somehow
the
knowledge
of
dick
nearness
gave
her
back
her
she
had
refused
to
let
alan
come
his
presence
in
the
audience
always
distracted
her
made
her
nervous
but
dick
was
different
it
was
almost
like
having
uncle
phil
himself
there
she
would
fail
now
she
could
it
was
for
the
honor
of
the
hill
a
moment
later
still
clutching
dick
comforting
card
she
ran
in
on
the
stage
swinging
her
from
its
green
ribbons
with
hoydenish
grace
chanting
a
gay
little
lilt
of
an
irish
melody
her
fear
had
gone
even
as
the
dew
might
have
disappeared
at
the
kiss
of
the
sun
upon
the
killarney
greensward
almost
at
once
she
discovered
dick
and
sang
a
part
of
her
song
straight
down
at
him
a
little
later
she
dared
to
let
her
eyes
stray
to
the
box
where
carol
clay
sat
the
actress
smiled
and
tony
smiled
back
and
then
forgot
she
was
tony
was
henceforth
only
rose
of
killarney
it
was
a
winsome
sort
of
play
with
an
almost
barriesque
charm
and
whimsicality
to
it
the
witching
little
rose
laughed
and
danced
and
sang
and
flirted
and
wept
and
loved
her
way
through
it
and
in
the
end
threw
herself
in
the
right
lover
arms
presumably
there
to
dwell
happy
forever
after
after
the
last
curtain
went
down
and
she
had
smiled
and
bowed
and
kissed
her
hand
to
the
kindly
audience
over
and
over
tony
fled
to
the
dressing
room
where
she
could
still
hear
the
intoxicating
delightful
thunder
of
applause
it
had
come
she
could
act
she
could
oh
she
could
live
and
be
any
happier
but
after
all
she
could
stand
a
little
more
joy
without
coming
to
an
untimely
end
for
there
suddenly
smiling
at
her
from
the
threshold
was
carol
clay
congratulating
her
and
telling
her
what
a
pleasure
rose
had
been
to
the
rose
of
yesterday
and
before
tony
could
get
her
breath
to
do
more
than
utter
a
rather
shy
and
gasping
word
of
gratitude
the
actress
had
invited
her
to
take
tea
with
her
on
the
next
day
and
she
had
accepted
and
carol
clay
was
gone
it
was
in
a
wonderful
world
of
dreams
that
tony
holiday
dwelt
as
she
removed
a
little
of
her
makeup
gave
orders
to
have
all
her
flowers
sent
to
a
hospital
except
alan
which
she
gathered
up
in
her
arms
and
drawing
her
velvet
cloak
around
her
stepped
out
into
the
but
it
was
a
world
of
rather
alarming
realities
that
she
went
into
there
was
dick
carson
waiting
as
she
had
bidden
him
to
wait
in
the
message
she
had
sent
him
and
there
was
alan
massey
unbidden
and
unexpected
and
both
these
males
with
whom
she
had
flirted
unconscionably
for
weeks
past
were
ominously
belligerent
of
manner
and
countenance
she
would
have
given
anything
to
have
had
a
wand
to
wave
the
two
away
keep
them
from
spoiling
her
perfect
evening
but
it
was
too
late
the
hour
of
reckoning
which
comes
even
to
queens
was
here
hello
you
two
she
greeted
putting
on
a
brave
front
for
all
her
sinking
heart
she
laid
down
the
roses
and
gave
a
hand
impartially
to
each
awfully
glad
to
see
you
dicky
alan
i
thought
i
told
you
not
to
come
were
you
here
all
the
same
i
was
i
told
you
so
in
my
note
did
you
get
it
i
sent
it
in
with
the
roses
he
nodded
at
the
flowers
she
had
just
surrendered
dick
eyes
shadowed
massey
had
scored
there
he
had
not
thought
of
flowers
indeed
there
had
been
no
time
to
get
any
he
had
gotten
the
assignment
so
late
there
had
been
quantities
of
other
flowers
he
knew
the
usher
had
carried
up
tons
of
them
it
seemed
to
the
popular
rose
but
she
carried
only
alan
massey
home
with
her
i
am
sorry
alan
i
did
see
it
maybe
it
was
there
i
did
half
look
at
the
flowers
your
message
did
me
so
much
good
dicky
i
was
scared
to
death
because
they
had
just
said
miss
clay
was
outside
and
somehow
when
i
knew
you
were
there
i
felt
all
right
again
i
carried
your
card
all
through
the
first
act
and
i
know
it
was
your
wishing
me
the
best
o
luck
that
brought
it
she
smiled
at
dick
and
it
was
alan
turn
to
glower
she
had
not
looked
at
his
roses
had
not
cared
to
look
for
his
message
but
she
carried
the
other
man
card
used
it
as
a
talisman
and
she
was
glad
the
other
was
there
but
she
had
forbidden
himself
alan
massey
to
come
had
even
reproached
him
for
coming
a
group
of
actors
passed
through
the
reception
room
calling
gay
goodnights
and
congratulations
to
tony
as
they
went
and
shooting
glances
of
friendly
curiosity
at
the
two
tall
frowning
men
between
whom
the
vivacious
rose
stood
tony
holiday
does
keep
all
her
lovers
on
the
stage
laughed
the
as
she
was
out
of
hearing
did
you
ever
see
two
gentlemen
that
hated
each
other
more
cordially
she
is
an
arrant
little
flirt
is
she
micky
the
speaker
challenged
the
irish
lover
of
the
play
who
had
had
the
luck
to
win
the
sweet
thorny
little
killarney
rose
in
the
end
and
to
get
a
real
albeit
a
play
kiss
from
the
pretty
little
heroine
who
as
tony
holiday
as
well
as
rose
was
prone
to
make
mischief
in
susceptible
male
hearts
she
can
have
me
any
minute
on
the
stage
or
off
answered
micky
promptly
she
a
winner
got
me
going
all
right
most
forgot
my
lines
she
was
so
darned
pretty
dick
took
advantage
of
the
confusion
of
the
interruption
to
get
in
his
word
will
you
come
out
with
me
for
a
bite
somewhere
tony
i
wo
keep
you
late
but
there
are
some
things
i
want
to
talk
over
with
you
tony
hesitated
she
had
caught
the
ominous
flash
of
alan
eyes
she
was
desperately
afraid
there
would
be
a
scene
if
she
said
yes
to
dick
now
in
alan
hearing
the
latter
strode
over
to
her
instantly
and
laid
his
hand
with
a
proprietorial
air
on
her
arm
from
this
point
of
vantage
he
faced
dick
insolently
miss
holiday
is
going
out
with
me
he
asserted
you
clear
out
the
tone
and
manner
even
more
than
the
words
were
deliberate
insult
dick
face
went
white
his
mouth
set
tight
there
was
almost
as
ugly
a
look
in
his
eyes
as
there
was
in
alan
tony
had
never
seen
him
look
like
that
and
was
frightened
i
clear
out
when
miss
holiday
asks
me
to
and
not
before
he
said
in
a
significantly
quiet
voice
do
go
too
far
massey
i
have
taken
a
good
deal
from
you
there
a
limit
tony
i
repeat
my
question
will
you
go
out
with
me
before
tony
could
speak
alan
massey
long
right
arm
shot
out
in
direction
dick
dodged
the
blow
coolly
hold
on
massey
he
said
i
perfectly
willing
to
smash
your
head
any
time
it
is
convenient
nothing
would
afford
me
greater
pleasure
in
fact
but
you
will
kindly
keep
from
making
trouble
here
you
ca
get
a
woman
name
mixed
up
with
a
cheap
brawl
such
as
you
are
trying
to
start
you
know
it
wo
do
alan
massey
white
face
turned
a
shade
whiter
his
arm
fell
he
turned
back
to
tony
real
anguish
in
his
eyes
i
beg
your
pardon
tony
dearest
he
bent
over
to
say
carson
is
right
we
fight
it
out
elsewhere
when
you
are
not
present
may
i
take
you
to
the
taxi
i
have
one
waiting
outside
another
group
of
people
passed
through
the
vestibule
said
goodnight
and
went
on
out
to
the
street
exit
it
made
tony
sick
to
think
of
what
they
would
have
seen
if
dick
had
lost
his
self
control
as
alan
had
she
thought
she
had
never
liked
dick
as
she
did
that
moment
never
despised
alan
massey
so
utterly
dick
was
a
man
alan
was
a
spoiled
child
a
weakling
the
slave
of
his
passions
it
was
no
thanks
to
him
that
her
name
was
not
already
bandied
about
on
people
lips
the
name
of
a
girl
about
whom
men
came
to
fist
blows
like
a
bowery
movie
scene
she
was
humiliated
all
over
enraged
with
alan
enraged
with
herself
for
stooping
to
care
for
a
man
like
that
she
waited
until
they
were
absolutely
alone
again
and
then
said
what
she
had
to
say
she
turned
to
face
alan
directly
you
may
take
me
nowhere
she
said
i
do
want
to
see
you
again
as
long
as
i
live
for
an
instant
alan
stared
at
her
dazed
unable
to
grasp
the
force
of
what
she
was
saying
the
significance
of
her
tone
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
artist
in
him
had
leaped
to
the
surface
banished
all
other
considerations
he
had
never
seen
tony
holiday
really
angry
before
she
was
magnificent
with
those
flashing
eyes
and
scarlet
cheeks
a
glorious
little
fury
a
valkyrie
he
would
paint
her
like
that
she
was
stupendous
the
most
vividly
alive
thing
he
had
ever
seen
like
flame
itself
in
her
flaming
anger
then
it
came
over
him
what
she
had
said
but
tony
he
pleaded
my
belovedest
he
put
out
both
hands
in
supplication
but
tony
whirled
away
from
them
she
snatched
the
great
bunch
of
red
roses
from
the
table
ran
to
the
window
flung
up
the
sash
hurled
them
out
into
the
night
then
she
turned
back
to
alan
now
go
she
commanded
pointing
with
a
small
inexorable
hand
to
the
door
alan
massey
went
tony
dropped
in
a
chair
spent
and
trembling
all
but
in
tears
the
disagreeable
scene
the
piled
up
complex
of
emotions
coming
on
top
of
the
stress
and
strain
of
the
play
were
almost
too
much
for
her
she
was
a
quivering
bundle
of
nerves
and
misery
at
the
moment
dick
came
to
her
forgive
me
tony
i
should
have
forced
the
issue
maybe
but
i
could
stand
any
more
from
that
cad
i
am
glad
you
did
exactly
what
you
did
do
dick
and
i
am
more
grateful
than
i
can
ever
tell
you
for
not
letting
alan
get
you
into
a
fight
here
in
this
place
with
all
these
people
coming
and
going
i
would
never
have
gotten
over
it
if
anything
like
that
had
happened
it
would
have
been
terrible
i
could
ever
have
looked
any
of
them
in
the
face
again
she
shivered
and
put
her
two
hands
over
her
eyes
ashamed
to
the
quick
at
the
thought
dick
sat
down
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
one
hand
resting
gently
on
the
girl
shoulder
do
cry
tony
he
begged
i
ca
stand
it
you
need
have
worried
there
was
any
danger
of
anything
like
that
happening
i
care
too
much
to
let
you
in
for
anything
of
that
sort
so
does
he
for
that
matter
he
saw
it
in
a
minute
he
really
would
want
to
do
you
any
harm
anyway
tony
even
i
know
that
and
you
must
know
it
better
than
i
tony
put
down
her
hands
looked
at
dick
i
suppose
that
is
true
she
sighed
he
does
love
me
dick
he
does
tony
i
wish
he
did
and
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
i
were
sure
you
did
love
him
tony
sighed
again
and
her
eyes
fell
i
wish
i
were
sure
too
she
faltered
dick
winced
at
that
he
had
no
answer
what
was
there
to
say
i
do
see
why
i
should
care
i
do
see
how
i
can
care
after
he
is
horrid
in
lots
of
ways
a
cad
just
as
you
called
him
i
know
larry
would
feel
just
as
you
do
and
hate
to
have
him
come
near
me
larry
and
i
have
almost
quarreled
about
it
now
he
thinks
uncle
phil
is
all
wrong
not
to
forbid
my
seeing
alan
at
all
but
uncle
phil
is
too
wise
he
does
want
to
have
me
marry
alan
any
more
than
the
rest
of
you
do
but
he
knows
if
he
fights
it
it
would
put
me
on
the
other
side
in
a
minute
and
i
do
it
maybe
in
spite
of
everybody
tony
you
are
engaged
to
him
she
shook
her
head
not
exactly
i
am
afraid
i
might
as
well
be
though
i
said
i
ever
want
to
see
him
again
but
i
did
mean
it
i
shall
want
to
see
him
again
by
i
always
do
no
matter
what
he
does
i
always
shall
i
am
afraid
it
is
like
that
with
me
i
sorry
dicky
i
ought
to
have
told
you
that
before
i
been
horrid
not
to
i
know
take
me
home
now
please
i
tired
awfully
tired
going
home
in
the
cab
neither
spoke
until
just
as
they
were
within
a
few
blocks
of
the
hostelry
when
dick
broke
the
silence
i
am
sorry
all
this
had
to
happen
he
said
because
well
i
am
going
away
tomorrow
going
away
dick
where
it
was
horribly
selfish
of
her
tony
knew
but
it
did
seem
as
if
she
could
bear
to
have
dick
go
it
seemed
as
if
the
only
thing
that
was
stable
in
her
reeling
life
would
be
gone
if
he
went
if
he
went
she
would
belong
to
alan
more
and
more
there
would
be
nothing
to
hold
her
back
she
was
afraid
she
clung
to
dick
he
alone
of
the
whole
city
full
of
human
beings
was
a
symbol
of
holiday
hill
with
him
gone
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
would
be
hopelessly
adrift
on
perilous
seas
to
mexico
vera
cruz
i
believe
he
answered
her
question
vera
cruz
dick
you
must
it
is
awful
down
there
now
everybody
says
so
he
smiled
a
little
at
that
it
is
because
it
is
more
or
less
awful
that
they
are
sending
me
he
said
journalism
is
much
interested
in
placidity
a
newspaper
man
has
to
be
where
things
are
happening
fast
and
plenty
if
things
are
hot
down
there
so
much
the
better
they
will
sizzle
more
in
the
copy
dick
i
ca
have
you
go
i
ca
bear
it
tony
hand
crept
into
his
something
dreadful
might
happen
to
you
she
wailed
he
pressed
her
hand
grateful
for
her
real
trouble
about
him
and
for
her
caring
oh
no
dear
nothing
dreadful
will
happen
to
me
you
must
worry
he
soothed
but
i
do
i
shall
how
can
i
help
it
it
is
just
as
if
larry
or
ted
were
going
it
scares
me
dick
drew
away
his
hand
suddenly
for
heaven
sake
tony
please
do
tell
me
again
that
i
just
like
larry
and
ted
to
you
it
is
bad
enough
to
know
it
without
your
rubbing
it
in
all
the
time
i
ca
stand
it
not
dick
tony
was
startled
taken
aback
by
his
tone
dick
rarely
let
himself
go
like
that
in
a
moment
he
was
all
contrition
forgive
me
tony
i
sorry
i
said
that
i
ought
to
be
thankful
you
care
that
much
and
i
am
it
is
dear
of
you
and
i
do
appreciate
it
oh
me
sighed
tony
everything
i
do
or
say
is
wrong
i
wish
i
did
care
the
other
way
for
you
dicky
dear
truly
i
do
it
would
be
so
much
nicer
and
simpler
than
caring
for
alan
she
added
naïvely
life
is
fixed
nice
and
simple
tony
at
least
it
never
has
been
for
me
oh
dick
everything
has
been
horribly
hard
for
you
always
and
making
it
harder
i
do
want
to
dicky
dear
you
know
i
do
it
is
just
that
i
ca
help
it
i
know
tony
you
must
bother
about
me
i
all
right
will
you
tell
me
just
one
thing
though
if
you
had
cared
for
massey
no
i
wo
put
it
like
that
if
you
had
cared
for
me
would
my
not
having
any
name
have
made
any
difference
of
course
it
would
have
made
any
difference
dicky
what
does
a
name
matter
you
are
you
and
that
is
what
i
would
care
for
do
care
for
the
rest
does
matter
besides
you
are
making
a
name
for
yourself
i
am
doing
it
under
your
name
the
one
you
gave
me
i
am
proud
to
have
it
used
that
way
why
would
i
be
it
is
honored
you
have
not
only
lived
up
to
it
as
you
promised
uncle
phil
you
have
made
it
stand
for
something
fine
your
stories
are
splendid
you
are
going
to
be
famous
and
i
why
dicky
just
think
it
will
be
my
name
you
will
take
on
up
to
the
stars
oh
we
here
as
the
cab
jolted
to
a
halt
in
front
of
the
hostelry
the
cabby
flung
open
the
door
tony
and
dick
stepped
out
went
up
the
steps
in
a
moment
they
were
alone
in
the
dimly
lit
hall
tony
would
you
mind
letting
me
kiss
you
just
once
as
you
would
larry
or
ted
if
one
of
them
were
going
off
on
a
long
journey
away
from
you
dick
voice
was
humble
pleading
it
touched
tony
deeply
and
sent
the
quick
tears
welling
up
into
her
eyes
as
she
raised
her
face
to
his
for
a
moment
he
held
her
close
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
then
released
her
tony
thank
you
and
god
bless
you
he
said
a
little
huskily
as
he
let
her
go
dick
and
then
impulsively
tony
put
up
her
lips
and
kissed
him
the
first
time
he
ever
remembered
a
woman
lips
touching
his
a
second
later
the
door
closed
upon
him
shutting
him
out
in
the
night
he
dismissed
the
cab
driver
and
walked
blindly
off
not
knowing
or
caring
in
what
direction
he
went
it
was
hours
before
he
let
himself
into
his
lodging
house
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
have
girdled
the
earth
on
the
strength
of
tony
holiday
kiss
the
next
morning
he
was
off
for
mexico
chapter
xxvi
the
kaleidoscope
revolves
tony
slept
late
next
morning
and
when
she
did
open
her
eyes
they
fell
upon
a
huge
florist
box
by
the
door
and
a
special
delivery
letter
on
top
of
it
the
maid
had
set
the
two
in
an
hour
ago
and
tiptoed
away
lest
she
waken
the
weary
little
sleeper
tony
got
up
and
opened
the
box
roses
dozens
of
them
worth
the
price
of
a
month
wages
to
many
a
worker
in
the
city
frail
exquisite
beauties
with
gold
at
their
hearts
tony
adored
roses
but
she
almost
hated
these
because
it
seemed
to
her
alan
was
bribing
her
forgiveness
by
playing
upon
her
worship
of
their
beauty
and
fragrance
still
kneeling
by
the
flowers
she
glanced
at
the
clock
dick
was
already
miles
away
on
his
hateful
journey
had
gone
sad
and
hopeless
because
she
loved
alan
massey
why
did
it
have
to
be
so
why
was
love
so
perverse
and
unreasonable
a
thing
alan
was
not
worthy
to
touch
hand
though
in
his
arrogance
he
affected
to
despise
the
other
but
it
was
alan
she
loved
not
dick
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
her
dreadfully
wrong
that
it
should
be
so
after
last
night
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
that
she
sat
down
on
the
floor
opened
alan
letter
despised
herself
for
letting
its
author
spell
creep
over
her
anew
with
every
word
it
was
an
abject
plea
for
mercy
for
forgiveness
for
restoration
to
favor
it
had
been
a
devil
of
jealousy
that
had
possessed
him
he
had
not
known
what
he
was
doing
surely
she
must
know
that
he
would
not
willingly
harm
or
hurt
or
anger
her
in
any
way
he
loved
her
too
much
carson
had
behaved
like
a
man
alan
would
apologize
to
him
if
the
other
man
would
accept
the
apology
it
was
tony
really
who
had
driven
him
mad
by
being
so
much
kinder
to
the
other
than
to
himself
she
must
realize
what
he
was
not
drive
him
too
far
i
am
sending
you
roses
he
ended
please
do
throw
them
away
as
you
did
the
others
keep
them
and
let
them
plead
for
me
and
do
ah
tony
do
ever
ever
say
again
what
you
said
last
night
that
you
never
wanted
to
see
me
again
you
do
mean
it
i
know
but
do
say
it
it
kills
me
to
hear
you
if
you
throw
me
over
i
blow
my
brains
out
as
sure
as
i
am
a
living
man
this
moment
but
you
wo
you
can
not
tony
dearest
you
will
forgive
me
stand
by
me
rotten
as
i
am
you
are
mine
you
love
me
you
wo
push
me
down
to
hell
it
was
a
cowardly
letter
tony
thought
a
letter
calculated
to
frighten
her
bring
her
to
subjection
again
as
well
as
to
gratify
the
writer
own
byronic
instinct
for
pose
he
had
behaved
badly
he
acknowledged
it
but
claimed
forgiveness
on
the
grounds
of
love
his
love
for
her
which
had
been
goaded
to
mad
jealousy
by
her
thoughtless
unkindness
her
love
for
him
which
would
not
desert
him
no
matter
what
he
did
but
pose
or
not
tony
was
obliged
to
admit
there
was
some
truth
in
it
all
perhaps
it
was
all
true
even
if
he
did
not
resort
to
the
pistol
as
he
threatened
he
would
find
other
means
of
slaying
his
soul
if
not
his
body
if
she
forsook
him
now
she
could
not
do
it
as
he
said
she
loved
him
too
well
she
had
gone
too
far
in
the
path
to
turn
back
now
ah
why
why
had
she
let
it
go
so
far
why
had
she
not
listened
to
dick
to
uncle
phil
to
carlotta
even
to
miss
lottie
they
had
all
told
her
there
was
no
happiness
for
her
in
loving
alan
massey
she
knew
it
herself
better
than
any
of
them
could
possibly
know
it
and
yet
she
had
to
go
on
for
his
sake
for
her
own
because
she
loved
him
by
this
time
she
was
no
longer
angry
or
resentful
she
was
just
sorry
sorry
for
alan
sorry
for
herself
she
knew
just
as
she
had
known
all
along
that
last
night
incident
would
not
really
make
any
difference
it
would
be
put
away
in
time
with
all
the
other
things
she
had
to
forgive
she
had
eaten
her
pomegranate
seeds
she
could
not
escape
the
dark
kingdom
she
did
not
wish
to
later
came
violets
from
dick
which
she
put
in
a
vase
on
her
desk
beside
uncle
phil
picture
but
it
was
the
fragrance
and
color
of
alan
roses
that
filled
the
room
and
presently
she
sat
down
and
wrote
her
lover
a
sweet
forgiving
little
note
she
was
sorry
if
she
had
been
unkind
she
had
not
meant
to
be
as
for
what
happened
it
was
too
late
to
worry
about
it
now
they
had
best
forget
it
if
they
could
he
could
very
well
apologize
to
dick
in
person
because
he
was
already
on
his
way
to
mexico
there
was
no
need
of
any
penance
of
course
she
forgave
him
knew
he
had
not
meant
to
hurt
her
though
he
had
horribly
if
he
cared
to
do
so
he
might
take
her
to
dinner
tomorrow
night
somewhere
where
they
could
dance
and
in
conclusion
she
was
always
his
tony
holiday
both
dick
and
alan
were
driven
out
of
her
mind
later
that
day
by
the
delightful
and
exciting
interview
over
the
tea
table
with
carol
clay
miss
clay
was
a
charming
hostess
drew
the
girl
out
without
appearing
to
do
so
got
her
to
talk
naturally
about
many
things
her
life
with
her
father
at
army
barracks
and
with
her
uncle
on
her
beloved
hill
of
her
friends
and
brothers
her
college
life
of
books
and
plays
plays
took
them
to
the
killarney
rose
and
once
more
miss
clay
expressed
her
pleasure
in
the
girl
rendering
of
one
of
her
own
favorite
roles
you
acted
as
if
you
had
been
playing
rose
all
your
life
she
added
with
a
smile
maybe
i
have
said
tony
rose
is
a
good
deal
like
me
maybe
that
is
why
i
loved
playing
her
so
i
should
wonder
you
are
a
real
little
actress
my
dear
i
wonder
if
you
are
ready
to
pay
the
price
of
it
it
is
bitterly
hard
work
and
it
means
giving
up
half
the
things
women
care
for
the
speaker
lovely
eyes
shadowed
a
little
tony
wondered
what
carol
clay
had
given
up
was
giving
up
for
her
art
to
bring
that
look
into
them
i
am
not
afraid
i
am
willing
to
work
i
love
it
and
i
i
am
willing
to
give
up
a
good
deal
lovers
smiled
miss
clay
must
i
i
thought
actresses
always
had
lovers
at
least
worshipers
ca
i
keep
the
lovers
miss
clay
there
was
a
flash
of
mischief
in
tony
eyes
as
she
asked
the
important
question
better
stick
to
worshipers
lovers
are
risky
husbands
fatal
tony
laughed
outright
at
that
i
am
willing
to
postpone
the
fatality
she
murmured
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
for
i
lured
you
here
to
take
you
into
a
plot
i
suppose
you
did
not
suspect
that
it
was
max
hempel
who
sent
me
to
see
you
play
rose
hempel
i
thought
he
had
forgotten
me
he
never
forgets
any
one
in
whom
he
is
interested
he
has
had
his
eye
on
you
ever
since
he
saw
you
play
rosalind
he
told
me
when
he
came
back
from
that
trip
that
i
had
a
rival
coming
on
oh
no
tony
objected
even
in
jest
to
such
desecration
oh
yes
smiled
her
hostess
max
hempel
is
a
brutally
frank
person
he
never
spares
one
the
truth
even
the
disagreeable
truth
he
has
had
his
eye
out
for
a
new
ingénue
for
a
long
time
ingénues
do
get
old
at
least
older
you
know
not
you
denied
tony
even
i
in
time
i
grant
you
not
yet
it
takes
a
degree
of
age
and
sophistication
to
play
youth
and
innocence
we
do
it
better
as
a
rule
at
thirty
than
at
twenty
we
are
far
enough
away
from
it
to
stand
off
and
observe
how
it
behaves
and
can
imitate
it
better
than
if
we
still
had
it
that
is
one
reason
i
was
interested
in
your
rose
last
night
you
played
like
a
little
girl
as
rose
should
you
looked
like
a
little
girl
but
you
could
have
given
it
that
delightfully
sure
touch
if
you
had
been
a
little
bit
grown
up
do
you
understand
tony
nodded
i
think
so
you
see
i
am
a
little
bit
grown
up
do
grow
up
any
more
you
are
adorable
as
you
are
but
to
business
have
you
seen
my
madge
in
the
of
the
rainbow
yes
indeed
i
love
it
you
like
the
part
too
do
you
you
play
it
as
if
you
did
i
do
i
like
it
better
than
any
i
have
had
since
rose
did
it
occur
to
you
that
you
would
like
to
play
madge
yourself
tony
blushed
ingenuously
well
yes
it
did
she
admitted
half
shyly
of
course
i
knew
i
could
play
it
as
you
did
it
takes
years
of
experience
and
a
real
art
like
yours
to
do
it
like
that
but
i
did
think
i
like
to
try
it
and
see
what
i
could
do
miss
clay
nodded
well
pleased
of
course
you
did
why
not
it
is
your
kind
of
a
role
just
as
rose
is
you
and
i
are
the
same
types
hempel
has
said
that
all
along
ever
since
he
saw
your
rosalind
but
i
wo
keep
you
in
suspense
the
long
and
short
of
all
this
preliminary
is
how
would
you
like
to
be
my
understudy
for
madge
oh
miss
clay
tony
gasped
do
you
think
i
could
i
know
you
could
my
dear
i
knew
it
all
the
time
while
i
was
watching
you
play
rose
hempel
has
known
it
even
longer
i
went
to
see
rose
to
find
out
if
there
was
a
madge
in
you
there
is
i
told
hempel
so
this
morning
he
is
brewing
his
contracts
now
so
be
prepared
will
you
try
it
i
love
to
if
you
and
hempel
think
i
can
i
promised
uncle
phil
i
would
take
a
year
of
the
school
work
though
will
i
have
to
drop
that
i
think
so
most
of
it
at
least
you
would
have
to
be
at
the
rehearsals
usually
which
are
in
the
morning
you
might
have
to
play
madge
quite
often
then
there
are
reasons
why
i
have
to
be
away
a
great
deal
just
now
again
the
shadow
darkened
the
star
eyes
and
a
droop
came
to
her
mouth
it
is
even
so
impossible
that
you
would
be
called
upon
to
play
before
the
real
broadway
audience
in
fact
understudies
sometimes
do
you
know
miss
clay
was
smiling
now
but
the
shadow
in
her
eyes
had
not
lifted
tony
saw
i
am
particularly
anxious
to
get
a
good
understudy
started
in
immediately
the
actress
continued
the
one
i
had
was
impossible
did
not
get
the
spirit
of
the
thing
at
all
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
have
some
one
ready
and
at
once
my
little
daughter
is
in
a
sanitarium
dying
with
an
incurable
heart
leakage
there
will
be
a
time
probably
within
the
next
two
months
when
i
shall
have
to
be
away
tony
put
out
her
hand
and
let
it
rest
upon
the
other
woman
there
was
compassion
in
her
young
eyes
i
am
so
sorry
she
said
simply
i
did
know
you
had
a
daughter
of
course
i
did
know
you
were
really
miss
clay
that
you
were
somebody
but
i
did
think
of
your
having
children
somehow
we
remember
actresses
may
be
mothers
too
the
actresses
remember
it
sometimes
said
miss
clay
with
a
tremulous
little
smile
it
is
easy
to
laugh
when
your
heart
is
heavy
miss
antoinette
it
is
all
i
can
do
to
go
on
with
sometimes
i
just
have
to
forget
make
myself
forget
i
am
a
mother
and
a
wife
captain
carey
my
husband
is
in
the
british
army
he
is
in
flanders
now
or
was
when
i
last
heard
oh
i
do
see
how
you
can
do
it
play
i
mean
sighed
tony
aghast
at
this
new
picture
the
actress
words
brought
up
one
learns
my
dear
one
has
to
an
actress
is
two
distinct
persons
one
of
her
belongs
to
the
public
the
other
is
just
a
plain
woman
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
i
were
far
more
the
first
than
i
am
the
second
there
would
be
any
more
contracts
if
i
were
not
but
never
mind
that
to
come
back
to
you
hempel
will
send
you
a
contract
will
you
sign
it
yes
if
uncle
phil
is
willing
i
wire
him
i
am
almost
positive
he
will
say
yes
he
is
very
reasonable
and
he
will
see
what
a
wonderful
wonderful
chance
this
is
for
me
i
ca
thank
you
enough
miss
clay
it
all
takes
my
breath
away
but
i
am
grateful
and
so
happy
you
ca
imagine
it
miss
clay
smiled
and
drew
on
her
gloves
the
interview
was
over
there
is
really
nothing
to
thank
me
for
she
said
the
favor
is
on
the
other
side
it
is
i
who
am
lucky
the
perfect
understudy
like
a
becoming
hat
is
hard
to
find
but
when
found
is
absolutely
beyond
price
may
i
send
you
a
pass
for
night
to
the
of
the
rainbow
perhaps
you
would
like
to
see
it
again
and
play
with
me
from
a
box
the
pass
will
admit
two
bring
one
of
the
lovers
if
you
like
tony
wired
her
uncle
that
night
in
the
morning
mail
arrived
max
contract
as
miss
clay
had
promised
tony
regarded
it
with
superstitious
awe
it
was
the
first
contract
she
had
ever
seen
in
her
life
much
less
had
offered
for
her
signature
the
terms
were
generous
appallingly
so
it
seemed
to
the
girl
who
knew
little
of
such
things
and
was
not
inclined
to
her
powers
financially
speaking
she
wisely
took
the
contract
over
to
the
school
and
got
the
manager
advice
to
go
ahead
we
nothing
comparable
to
offer
you
miss
tony
with
hempel
and
miss
clay
both
behind
you
you
are
practically
made
you
are
a
lucky
little
lady
i
know
a
dozen
experienced
actresses
in
this
city
who
would
give
their
best
cigarette
cases
to
be
in
your
shoes
arrived
home
at
the
hostelry
armed
with
this
approval
tony
found
her
uncle
answering
wire
bidding
her
do
as
she
thought
best
and
sending
heartiest
love
and
congratulations
dear
uncle
phil
and
then
she
sat
down
and
signed
the
impressive
document
that
made
her
carol
clay
understudy
and
a
real
person
all
the
afternoon
she
spent
in
long
delicious
dreamless
slumber
at
five
she
was
wakened
by
the
maid
bringing
a
letter
from
alan
a
wonderful
extravagant
such
as
only
he
could
pen
later
she
bathed
and
dressed
donning
the
white
and
silver
gown
she
had
worn
the
night
when
she
had
first
admitted
to
alan
in
carlotta
garden
that
she
loved
him
first
took
his
kisses
it
was
rather
a
sacred
little
gown
to
tony
sacred
to
alan
and
her
own
surrender
to
love
he
called
it
her
starlight
dress
and
loved
it
especially
because
it
brought
out
the
springlike
virginal
quality
of
her
youth
and
loveliness
as
her
other
more
sophisticated
gowns
did
not
tony
wore
it
for
alan
wanted
him
to
think
her
lovely
to
love
her
immensely
she
wanted
to
taste
all
life
joy
at
once
have
a
perfect
deluge
of
happiness
youth
must
be
served
alan
graceful
for
being
forgiven
so
easily
fell
in
with
her
mood
and
was
at
his
best
courtly
considerate
adoring
he
exerted
all
the
magic
of
his
not
inconsiderable
charm
to
make
tony
forget
that
other
unfortunate
night
when
he
had
appeared
in
other
less
attractive
colors
and
tony
was
ready
enough
to
forget
beneath
his
worshiping
green
eyes
and
under
the
spell
of
his
wonderful
voice
she
meant
to
shut
out
the
unwelcome
guests
of
fear
and
doubt
from
her
heart
let
love
alone
have
sway
they
dined
at
a
gorgeous
restaurant
in
a
great
hotel
tony
reveled
in
the
splendor
and
richness
of
the
setting
delighted
in
the
flawless
service
the
perfection
of
the
strange
and
delectable
viands
which
alan
ordered
for
their
consumption
particularly
she
delighted
in
alan
himself
and
the
way
he
fitted
into
the
richness
and
luxury
it
was
his
rightful
setting
she
could
not
imagine
him
in
any
of
the
shabby
restaurants
where
she
and
dick
had
often
dined
so
contentedly
alan
was
a
born
aristocrat
patrician
of
the
patricians
his
looks
his
manner
everything
about
him
betrayed
it
most
of
all
it
was
revealed
in
the
way
the
waiters
scurried
to
do
his
bidding
bowed
obsequiously
before
him
recognized
him
as
the
authentic
master
lord
of
the
purple
so
carson
really
has
gone
to
mexico
alan
murmured
as
they
dallied
over
their
salads
looking
mostly
into
each
other
eyes
yes
he
went
yesterday
i
hated
to
have
him
go
it
is
awfully
disagreeable
and
dangerous
down
there
they
say
he
might
get
a
fever
or
get
killed
or
something
tony
nibbling
a
piece
of
roll
already
saw
dick
in
her
mind
eye
the
victim
of
an
assassin
blade
no
such
luck
thought
alan
massey
bitterly
the
thought
brought
a
flash
of
venom
into
his
eyes
which
tony
unluckily
caught
alan
why
do
you
hate
dick
so
he
never
did
you
any
harm
tony
holiday
did
not
know
what
outrageous
injury
dick
had
done
his
cousin
alan
massey
alan
was
already
suavely
master
of
himself
the
venom
expunged
from
his
eyes
why
would
i
hate
him
you
are
half
in
love
with
him
i
am
not
denied
tony
indignantly
he
is
just
like
lar
she
broke
off
abruptly
remembering
dick
flare
of
resentment
at
that
familiar
formula
remembering
too
the
kiss
she
had
given
him
in
the
hall
in
the
hostelry
the
kiss
which
had
not
been
precisely
such
a
one
as
she
would
have
given
larry
alan
face
darkened
again
oh
yes
you
are
you
are
blushing
i
am
not
then
putting
her
hands
up
to
her
face
and
feeling
it
warm
she
changed
her
tactics
well
what
if
i
am
i
do
care
a
lot
about
dick
i
found
out
the
other
night
that
i
cared
a
whole
lot
more
than
i
knew
it
is
like
caring
for
larry
and
ted
it
different
for
after
all
he
is
my
brother
never
was
never
will
be
i
a
wretched
flirt
alan
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
i
let
dick
keep
on
loving
me
knowing
all
the
time
i
did
mean
to
marry
him
and
i
not
a
bit
sure
i
am
going
to
marry
you
either
tony
well
anyway
not
for
a
long
long
time
i
want
to
go
on
the
stage
i
ca
put
all
of
myself
into
my
work
and
give
it
to
you
at
the
same
time
i
do
want
to
get
married
i
do
dare
to
i
do
dare
even
let
myself
care
too
much
i
want
to
be
free
you
want
to
be
loved
of
course
every
woman
does
alan
made
an
impatient
gesture
i
do
mean
you
are
a
woman
not
a
piece
of
statuary
come
on
now
let
dance
they
danced
in
her
lover
arms
their
feet
keeping
time
to
the
syncopated
stirring
rhythms
of
the
violins
their
hearts
beating
to
a
mightier
harmony
of
nature
own
brewing
tony
holiday
was
far
from
being
a
piece
of
statuary
she
was
all
woman
a
woman
very
much
alive
and
very
much
in
love
alan
bent
over
her
tony
belovedest
there
are
more
things
than
art
in
the
world
he
said
softly
do
you
know
it
feel
it
there
is
life
and
life
is
bigger
than
your
work
or
mine
we
both
artists
but
we
be
bigger
artists
together
marry
me
now
do
make
me
wait
do
make
yourself
wait
you
want
it
as
much
as
i
do
say
yes
sweetheart
he
implored
tony
shook
her
head
vehemently
she
was
afraid
she
knew
that
just
now
all
her
dreams
of
success
in
her
chosen
art
all
her
love
for
the
dear
ones
at
home
were
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
this
greater
thing
which
alan
called
life
and
which
she
felt
surging
mightily
within
her
but
she
also
knew
that
this
way
lay
madness
disloyalty
regret
she
must
be
strong
strong
for
alan
as
well
as
for
herself
not
yet
she
whispered
back
be
patient
alan
i
love
you
dear
wait
the
music
came
to
an
end
many
eyes
followed
the
two
as
they
went
back
to
their
places
at
the
table
they
were
incomparable
artists
it
was
worth
missing
one
own
dance
to
see
them
have
theirs
aside
from
his
wonderful
dancing
and
striking
personality
alan
was
at
all
times
a
marked
figure
attracting
attention
wherever
he
went
and
whatever
he
did
the
public
knew
he
had
a
superlative
fortune
which
he
spent
magnificently
as
a
prince
and
that
he
had
a
superlative
gift
which
for
all
they
were
aware
he
had
flung
wantonly
away
as
soon
as
the
money
came
into
his
hands
moreover
he
was
even
more
interesting
because
of
his
superlatively
bad
reputation
which
still
followed
him
the
public
would
have
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
at
last
alan
massey
was
leading
the
most
temperate
and
arduous
of
lives
and
devoting
himself
exclusively
to
one
woman
whom
he
treated
as
reverently
as
if
she
were
a
goddess
the
gazes
focussed
upon
alan
now
inevitably
included
the
girl
with
him
as
lovely
and
young
as
spring
itself
who
was
she
they
asked
each
other
what
was
a
girl
like
that
doing
in
alan
massey
society
to
most
of
the
observers
it
meant
but
one
thing
eventually
if
not
now
even
the
most
cynical
and
thought
it
a
pity
and
these
would
have
been
confounded
if
they
could
have
heard
just
now
his
passionate
plea
for
marriage
one
did
not
associate
marriage
with
alan
massey
one
had
not
associated
it
too
much
with
his
mother
one
recalled
chapter
xxvii
troubled
waters
ted
holiday
drifted
into
berry
to
buy
floral
offerings
for
the
reigning
goddess
who
chanced
still
to
be
pretty
elsie
hathaway
things
had
gone
on
gayly
since
that
night
a
month
ago
when
he
had
stolen
that
impudent
kiss
beneath
the
crescent
moon
not
that
there
was
anything
at
all
serious
about
the
affair
college
coquettes
must
have
lovers
and
ted
holiday
would
not
have
been
himself
if
there
had
not
been
a
pretty
sweetheart
on
hand
by
this
time
ted
had
far
outdistanced
the
other
claimants
for
favor
but
the
victory
had
come
high
his
bank
account
was
again
sadly
humble
in
porportions
and
his
bills
at
berry
and
at
the
candy
shops
were
things
not
to
be
looked
into
too
closely
nevertheless
he
was
in
a
gala
humor
that
november
morning
aside
from
chronic
financial
complications
things
were
going
very
well
with
him
he
was
working
just
hard
enough
to
satisfy
his
common
sense
or
conscience
or
whatever
it
was
that
was
operating
he
was
having
a
jolly
good
time
with
elsie
and
basket
ball
and
other
things
and
college
life
did
seem
quite
such
a
bore
and
burden
as
it
had
hitherto
moreover
uncle
phil
had
just
written
that
he
would
waive
the
ten
dollar
automobile
tax
for
december
in
consideration
of
the
approach
of
christmas
possibly
also
in
consideration
of
his
nephew
fairly
creditable
showing
on
the
new
leaf
of
the
ledger
though
he
did
not
say
so
in
any
case
it
was
a
jolly
old
world
if
anybody
asked
ted
holiday
that
morning
as
he
entered
berry
he
made
straight
for
madeline
as
he
invariably
did
he
was
always
friendly
and
gay
and
casual
with
her
always
careful
to
let
no
one
suspect
he
had
ever
known
her
any
more
intimately
than
at
present
not
because
he
cared
on
his
own
account
ted
holiday
was
no
snob
but
because
he
had
sense
to
see
it
was
better
for
madeline
herself
he
was
genuinely
sorry
for
the
girl
he
could
not
help
seeing
how
her
despondency
grew
upon
her
from
week
to
week
and
that
she
appeared
miserably
sick
as
well
as
unhappy
she
looked
worse
than
usual
he
thought
white
and
and
unmistakably
it
troubled
him
to
see
her
so
ted
had
the
kindest
heart
in
the
world
and
always
wanted
every
one
else
to
be
as
blithely
content
with
life
as
he
was
himself
accordingly
now
under
cover
of
his
purchase
of
chrysanthemums
for
elsie
he
managed
to
get
in
a
word
in
her
ear
you
look
as
if
you
needed
cheering
up
a
bit
how
about
the
movies
charlie
on
he
fix
you
no
thank
you
i
could
the
girl
voice
was
also
prudently
low
and
she
busied
herself
with
the
flowers
instead
of
looking
at
ted
as
she
spoke
why
not
he
challenged
always
impelled
to
insistence
by
denial
because
i
and
then
to
ted
consternation
the
flowers
flew
out
of
her
hands
scattering
in
all
directions
her
face
went
chalky
white
and
she
fell
forward
in
a
heavy
faint
in
ted
holiday
arms
ted
got
her
to
a
chair
ordered
another
clerk
to
get
water
and
spirits
of
ammonia
quick
his
arm
was
still
around
her
when
patrick
berry
strayed
in
from
the
back
room
berry
eyes
narrowed
he
looked
the
girl
over
from
head
to
foot
surveyed
ted
holiday
also
with
sharp
scrutiny
and
knitted
brows
the
clerk
returned
with
water
and
dashed
off
for
the
ammonia
as
ordered
madeline
eyes
opened
slowly
meeting
ted
anxious
blue
ones
as
he
bent
over
her
ted
she
gasped
oh
ted
her
eyes
closed
again
wearily
berry
frown
deepened
his
best
customer
had
hitherto
in
his
hearing
been
invariably
addressed
by
the
girl
as
holiday
in
a
moment
madeline
eyes
opened
again
and
she
almost
pushed
ted
away
from
her
shooting
a
frightened
deprecating
glance
at
her
employer
as
she
did
so
i
i
am
all
right
now
she
said
rising
unsteadily
you
are
nothing
of
the
sort
madeline
protested
ted
also
forgetting
caution
in
his
concern
you
are
sick
i
get
a
taxi
and
take
you
home
berry
wo
mind
will
you
berry
appealed
the
best
customer
completely
unaware
of
the
queer
sharp
look
the
florist
was
bending
upon
him
no
she
better
go
agreed
berry
shortly
i
call
a
cab
he
walked
over
to
the
telephone
but
paused
his
hand
on
the
receiver
and
looked
back
at
ted
where
does
she
live
he
asked
do
you
know
cherry
returned
ted
still
unconsciously
revelatory
the
big
irishman
got
his
number
and
called
the
cab
the
clerk
came
back
with
the
ammonia
and
vanished
with
it
into
the
back
room
berry
walked
over
to
where
ted
stood
see
here
holiday
he
said
i
do
often
go
out
of
my
way
to
give
college
boys
advice
advice
is
about
the
one
thing
in
the
world
nobody
wants
but
i
going
to
give
you
a
bit
i
like
you
and
i
liked
your
brother
before
you
here
the
advice
stick
to
the
campus
do
get
mixed
up
with
cherry
street
you
wanted
the
chrysanthemums
sent
to
miss
hathaway
did
you
i
did
there
was
a
flash
in
ted
blue
eyes
send
and
send
a
dozen
of
your
best
roses
to
miss
madeline
taylor
cherry
and
mind
your
business
there
is
the
cab
ready
madeline
as
the
girl
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
her
coat
and
hat
on
i
take
you
home
oh
no
indeed
it
is
at
all
necessary
protested
madeline
you
have
done
quite
enough
as
it
is
holiday
you
must
bother
the
speaker
tone
was
cool
almost
cold
and
very
formal
she
did
not
know
that
patrick
berry
had
heard
that
very
different
fervid
ted
oh
ted
if
indeed
she
knew
it
had
ever
passed
her
lips
as
she
came
reluctantly
back
to
the
world
of
realities
ted
held
the
door
open
for
her
they
passed
out
but
a
moment
later
when
berry
peered
out
the
window
he
saw
the
cab
going
in
one
direction
and
his
best
customer
strolling
off
in
the
other
and
nodded
his
satisfaction
sauntering
along
his
nonchalant
course
madeline
taylor
already
half
forgotten
ted
holiday
came
face
to
face
with
old
doctor
hendricks
a
rosy
cheeked
white
bearded
twinkling
eyed
santa
claus
sort
of
person
who
had
known
his
father
and
uncle
and
brother
and
had
pulled
himself
through
various
minor
itises
and
sprains
seeing
the
doctor
reminded
him
of
madeline
hello
doc
just
the
man
i
wanted
to
see
want
a
job
got
more
jobs
than
i
can
tend
to
now
young
man
anything
the
matter
with
you
you
look
as
tough
as
a
two
year
old
rooster
the
old
man
small
kindly
shrewd
eyes
scanned
the
lad
face
as
he
spoke
smoking
less
sleeping
more
nerves
steadier
working
harder
playing
the
devil
lighter
he
gummed
up
silently
with
satisfaction
good
come
out
a
holiday
yet
if
we
give
him
time
i
am
tough
ted
grinned
back
all
unconscious
that
he
had
been
diagnosed
in
that
flitting
instant
of
time
never
felt
better
in
my
life
always
agrees
with
me
to
be
in
training
the
old
doctor
nodded
i
know
you
young
idiots
will
mind
your
coaches
when
you
wo
your
fathers
and
your
doctors
what
about
the
job
there
a
girl
i
know
who
works
at
berry
flower
shop
i
am
afraid
she
is
sick
though
she
wo
see
a
doctor
she
fainted
away
just
now
while
i
was
in
the
store
keeled
over
into
my
arms
scared
me
half
out
of
my
wits
i
worried
about
her
i
wish
you
would
go
and
see
her
she
lives
down
on
cherry
street
the
doctor
eyes
studied
the
boy
face
again
but
with
less
complacency
this
time
like
patrick
berry
he
thought
a
young
holiday
would
better
stick
to
the
campus
not
run
loose
on
cherry
street
know
the
girl
well
he
queried
ted
hesitated
flushed
looked
unmistakably
embarrassed
yes
rather
he
admitted
i
ran
round
with
her
quite
a
little
the
first
of
the
summer
i
got
her
the
job
at
berry
her
grandfather
a
pious
old
stick
in
the
mud
turned
her
out
of
his
house
she
had
to
do
something
to
earn
her
living
i
hope
she
is
going
to
be
sick
it
would
be
an
awful
mess
she
ca
have
much
saved
up
go
and
see
her
will
you
doc
cherry
taylor
is
the
name
the
doctor
made
a
note
of
these
facts
all
right
i
go
but
you
had
better
keep
away
from
cherry
street
young
man
it
is
not
the
environment
you
belong
in
environment
be
blessed
said
ted
do
you
begin
on
that
sort
of
rot
please
doc
old
pat
berry
just
been
giving
me
a
lecture
on
the
same
subject
you
make
me
tired
both
of
you
as
if
the
girls
on
cherry
street
were
as
good
any
day
as
the
ones
on
the
campus
just
because
they
work
in
shops
and
stores
and
the
girls
on
the
campus
work
us
he
concluded
with
a
grin
i
not
an
infant
that
has
to
be
kept
in
a
kiddie
coop
you
know
look
out
you
do
land
in
a
chicken
coop
sniffed
the
doctor
very
well
you
young
sinner
do
listen
to
me
if
you
do
want
to
i
know
i
might
as
well
talk
to
the
wind
you
always
were
open
to
all
the
fool
germs
going
ted
holiday
some
day
you
own
the
old
doc
knew
best
i
would
admit
to
being
so
hanged
well
up
on
the
proposition
myself
if
i
were
you
retorted
ted
impudently
so
long
much
obliged
for
your
kind
favors
all
but
the
moral
sentiments
you
can
have
those
back
you
may
need
to
use
over
again
so
ted
went
on
his
way
dropped
in
to
see
elsie
had
a
cup
of
tea
and
innumerable
small
cakes
enjoyed
a
foxtrot
to
phonograph
music
with
the
rug
rolled
up
out
of
the
way
conversed
amicably
with
the
ancient
history
prof
himself
who
was
such
a
bad
sort
as
profs
go
and
had
the
merit
of
being
one
of
the
few
instructors
who
had
not
flunked
ted
holiday
in
his
course
the
previous
year
the
next
morning
ted
found
a
letter
from
doctor
hendricks
in
his
mail
which
he
opened
with
some
curiosity
wondering
what
the
old
doc
could
have
to
say
he
read
the
communication
through
in
silence
and
tucking
it
in
his
pocket
walked
out
of
the
room
as
if
he
were
in
a
dream
paying
no
attention
to
the
question
somebody
called
after
him
as
he
went
he
went
on
to
his
classes
but
he
hardly
knew
what
was
going
on
about
him
his
mind
seemed
to
have
stopped
dead
like
a
stop
watch
with
the
reading
of
the
old
doctor
letter
he
understood
at
last
the
full
force
of
the
trouble
which
engulfed
madeline
taylor
and
why
she
had
said
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
her
if
that
mad
joy
ride
with
him
had
ended
life
for
her
the
doctor
had
gone
to
her
as
he
had
promised
and
had
extracted
the
whole
miserable
story
it
seemed
madeline
had
married
or
thought
she
had
married
willis
hubbard
against
her
grandfather
express
command
a
few
weeks
after
ted
had
parted
from
her
in
holyoke
in
less
than
two
months
hubbard
had
disappeared
leaving
behind
him
the
ugly
fact
that
he
already
had
one
wife
living
in
kansas
city
in
spite
of
the
pretense
of
a
wedding
ceremony
which
he
had
gone
through
with
madeline
long
since
disillusioned
but
still
having
power
and
pride
to
suffer
intensely
the
latter
found
herself
in
the
tragic
position
of
wife
and
yet
no
wife
in
her
desperate
plight
she
besought
her
grandfather
clemency
and
forgiveness
but
that
rigid
old
covenanter
had
declared
that
even
as
she
had
made
her
bed
in
willful
disobedience
to
his
command
so
she
should
lie
on
it
for
all
of
him
it
was
then
that
she
had
turned
as
a
last
resort
to
ted
holiday
though
always
hoping
against
hope
that
she
could
keep
the
real
truth
of
her
unhappy
situation
from
him
it
is
a
bad
affair
from
beginning
to
end
wrote
the
doctor
i
like
to
break
every
rotten
bone
in
that
scoundrel
body
but
he
has
taken
mighty
good
care
to
effect
a
complete
disappearance
that
kind
is
never
willing
to
foot
the
bills
for
their
own
villainy
i
am
telling
you
the
story
in
order
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
you
are
to
keep
out
of
the
business
from
now
on
you
have
burned
your
fingers
quite
enough
as
it
is
i
gather
do
see
the
girl
do
write
her
do
telephone
her
let
her
alone
absolutely
mind
these
are
polite
requests
they
are
orders
and
if
you
do
obey
them
i
turn
the
whole
thing
over
to
your
uncle
double
quick
and
i
do
think
you
want
me
to
do
that
do
worry
about
the
girl
i
look
after
her
now
and
later
when
she
is
likely
to
need
me
more
but
you
keep
hands
off
that
is
flat
the
girl
wish
as
well
as
my
orders
and
this
was
what
ted
holiday
had
to
carry
about
with
him
all
that
bleak
day
and
a
half
sleepless
uneasy
night
and
in
the
morning
he
was
summoned
home
to
the
house
on
the
hill
granny
was
dying
chapter
xxviii
in
dark
places
the
house
on
the
hill
was
a
strange
place
to
tony
and
ted
those
november
days
stranger
than
to
the
others
who
had
walked
day
by
day
with
the
sense
of
the
approaching
shadow
always
with
them
death
itself
was
an
awesome
and
unaccustomed
thing
to
them
they
did
not
see
how
the
others
bore
it
so
well
took
it
all
so
calmly
to
make
matters
worse
uncle
phil
who
never
failed
any
one
was
stricken
down
with
a
bad
case
of
influenza
and
was
unable
to
leave
his
bed
this
of
course
made
margery
also
practically
de
the
little
folks
spent
most
of
their
time
across
the
street
in
motherly
lambert
care
upon
ned
children
rested
the
chief
burden
of
the
hour
granny
was
rarely
conscious
and
all
three
of
her
grandchildren
coveted
the
sad
privilege
of
being
near
her
when
these
brief
moments
of
lucidity
came
though
tony
and
ted
could
not
stand
long
periods
of
watching
beside
the
still
form
as
larry
could
and
did
it
was
larry
that
she
most
often
recognized
sometimes
though
he
was
his
father
to
her
and
she
called
him
ned
in
such
tones
of
yearning
tenderness
that
it
nearly
broke
down
his
self
control
sometimes
too
he
was
philip
to
her
and
this
also
was
bitterly
hard
for
larry
missed
his
uncle
support
woefully
in
this
dark
hour
ruth
granny
seemed
to
know
oftener
indeed
than
she
did
tony
to
the
latter
keen
grief
though
she
acknowledged
the
justice
of
the
stab
for
she
had
gone
her
selfish
way
leaving
the
stranger
to
play
the
loving
granddaughter
part
one
night
when
the
nurse
was
resting
and
larry
too
had
flung
himself
upon
the
couch
in
the
living
room
to
snatch
a
little
much
needed
relaxation
leaving
ruth
in
charge
of
the
sickroom
ted
drifted
in
and
demanded
to
take
his
turn
at
the
watch
giving
ruth
a
chance
to
sleep
she
demurred
at
first
knowing
how
hard
these
vigils
were
for
the
restless
unhappy
lad
but
seeing
he
was
really
in
earnest
she
yielded
as
she
passed
out
of
the
room
her
hand
rested
for
a
moment
on
the
boy
bowed
head
she
had
come
to
care
a
great
deal
for
sunny
teddy
loved
him
for
himself
and
because
she
knew
he
loved
larry
with
deep
devotion
he
looked
up
with
a
faint
smile
and
gave
her
hand
a
squeeze
you
are
a
darling
ruthie
he
murmured
do
know
what
we
would
ever
do
without
you
and
then
he
was
alone
with
death
and
his
own
somber
thoughts
he
could
not
get
away
from
the
memory
of
madeline
could
not
help
feeling
with
a
terrible
weight
of
responsibility
that
he
was
more
than
a
little
to
blame
for
her
plight
whether
he
liked
to
think
it
or
not
he
could
help
knowing
that
the
whole
thing
had
started
with
that
foolish
joy
ride
with
himself
madeline
had
never
risked
her
grandfather
displeasure
till
she
risked
it
for
him
she
had
never
gone
anywhere
with
hubbard
till
she
went
because
she
was
bitterly
angry
with
himself
because
he
had
not
kept
his
promise
a
promise
which
never
should
have
been
made
in
the
first
place
and
if
he
had
not
gone
to
holyoke
had
behaved
like
an
idiot
that
last
night
had
deserted
her
like
a
selfish
cad
to
save
his
own
precious
self
if
none
of
these
things
had
happened
would
madeline
still
have
gone
to
hubbard
perhaps
but
in
his
heart
ted
holiday
had
a
hateful
conviction
that
she
would
not
that
her
wretchedness
now
was
indirectly
if
not
directly
chargeable
to
his
own
folly
it
was
terrible
that
such
little
things
should
have
such
tremendous
consequences
but
there
it
was
all
his
life
ted
holiday
had
evaded
responsibility
and
had
found
self
extenuation
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
but
somehow
all
at
once
he
seemed
to
have
lost
the
power
of
letting
himself
off
he
had
no
plea
to
offer
even
to
himself
except
guilty
was
he
going
to
do
as
doctor
hendricks
commanded
and
let
madeline
pay
the
price
of
her
own
folly
alone
or
was
he
going
to
pay
with
her
the
night
was
full
of
the
question
the
quiet
figure
on
the
bed
stirred
instantly
the
boy
had
forgotten
himself
remembered
only
granny
he
bent
over
her
granny
do
you
know
me
it
teddy
he
pleaded
the
white
lips
quivered
into
a
faint
smile
the
frail
hand
on
the
cover
lid
groped
vaguely
for
his
i
know
teddy
the
lips
formed
slowly
with
an
effort
ted
kissed
her
tears
in
his
eyes
be
a
man
dear
the
lips
breathed
softly
be
and
granny
was
off
again
to
a
world
of
unconsciousness
from
which
she
had
returned
a
moment
to
give
her
message
to
the
grief
stricken
lad
by
her
side
to
ted
in
his
overwrought
condition
the
words
were
almost
like
a
voice
from
heaven
a
sacred
command
to
be
a
man
meant
to
face
the
hardest
thing
he
had
ever
had
to
face
in
his
life
it
meant
marrying
madeline
taylor
not
leaving
her
like
a
coward
to
pay
by
herself
for
something
which
he
himself
had
helped
to
start
he
rose
softly
and
went
to
the
window
staring
out
into
the
night
a
few
moments
later
he
turned
back
wearing
a
strange
uplifted
sort
of
look
a
look
perhaps
such
as
percival
bore
when
he
beheld
the
grail
strange
forces
were
at
work
in
the
house
on
the
hill
that
night
ruth
had
gone
to
her
room
to
rest
as
ted
bade
her
but
she
had
not
slept
in
spite
of
her
intense
weariness
she
had
almost
lost
the
way
of
sleep
latterly
she
was
always
so
afraid
of
not
being
near
when
larry
needed
her
the
night
watches
they
had
shared
so
often
now
had
brought
them
very
very
close
to
each
other
made
their
love
a
very
sacred
as
well
as
very
strong
thing
ruth
knew
that
the
time
was
near
now
when
she
would
have
to
go
away
from
the
hill
after
granny
went
there
would
be
no
excuse
for
staying
on
if
she
did
not
go
larry
would
ruth
knew
that
very
well
and
did
not
intend
the
latter
should
happen
she
had
laid
her
plans
well
she
would
go
and
take
a
secretarial
course
somewhere
she
had
made
inquiries
and
found
that
there
was
always
demand
for
secretaries
and
that
the
training
did
not
take
so
long
as
other
professional
education
did
she
could
sell
her
rings
and
live
on
the
money
they
brought
her
until
she
was
self
supporting
she
did
not
want
to
dispose
of
her
pearls
if
she
could
help
it
she
wanted
to
hold
on
to
them
as
the
link
to
her
lost
past
yes
she
would
leave
the
hill
it
was
quite
the
right
thing
to
do
but
oh
what
a
hard
thing
it
was
she
did
not
see
how
she
was
ever
going
to
face
life
alone
under
such
hard
queer
conditions
without
doctor
philip
without
dear
margery
and
the
children
without
larry
especially
without
larry
for
that
matter
what
would
larry
do
without
her
he
needed
her
so
loved
her
so
much
poor
larry
and
suddenly
ruth
sat
up
in
bed
as
clearly
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
room
with
her
she
heard
larry
voice
calling
to
her
she
sprang
up
and
threw
a
dark
blue
satin
negligee
around
her
went
out
of
the
room
down
the
stairs
seeming
to
know
by
an
infallible
instinct
where
her
lover
was
on
the
threshold
of
the
living
room
she
paused
larry
was
pacing
the
floor
nervously
his
face
drawn
and
gray
in
the
dim
light
of
the
flickering
gas
seeing
her
he
made
a
swift
stride
in
her
direction
took
both
her
hands
in
his
ruth
why
did
you
come
there
was
an
odd
tension
in
his
voice
you
called
me
did
you
i
thought
you
did
her
eyes
were
wondering
i
heard
you
say
as
plain
as
anything
he
shook
his
head
no
i
did
call
you
out
loud
maybe
i
did
with
my
heart
though
i
wanted
you
so
he
dropped
her
hands
as
abruptly
as
he
had
taken
them
ruth
i
got
to
marry
you
i
ca
go
on
like
this
i
tried
to
fight
it
to
be
patient
and
hang
on
to
myself
as
uncle
phil
wanted
me
to
but
i
ca
go
on
i
done
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
his
head
went
down
on
the
table
the
clock
ticked
quietly
on
the
mantel
what
was
death
upstairs
to
time
what
were
youth
and
love
and
grief
down
here
these
things
were
merely
eddies
in
the
great
tide
of
eternity
for
a
moment
ruth
stood
very
still
then
she
went
over
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
bowed
head
the
hand
that
wore
the
wedding
ring
larry
larry
dear
she
said
softly
do
give
up
like
that
it
breaks
my
heart
there
was
a
faint
tremor
in
her
voice
a
hint
of
tears
not
far
off
he
lifted
his
head
the
strain
of
his
long
self
mastering
wearing
thin
almost
to
the
breaking
point
at
last
for
once
all
but
at
the
mercy
of
the
dominant
emotion
which
possessed
him
his
love
for
the
girl
at
his
side
who
stood
so
close
he
could
feel
her
breathing
got
the
faint
violet
fragrance
of
her
and
yet
he
must
not
so
much
as
touch
her
hand
the
clock
struck
three
solemn
inexorable
strokes
ruth
and
larry
and
the
clock
seemed
the
only
living
things
in
the
quiet
house
larry
brushed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
got
to
his
feet
ruth
will
you
marry
me
yes
larry
the
shock
of
her
quiet
consent
brought
larry
back
a
little
to
realities
wait
ruth
do
agree
too
soon
do
you
realize
what
it
means
to
marry
me
you
may
be
married
already
your
husband
may
return
and
find
you
living
illegally
with
me
i
know
said
ruth
steadily
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
me
larry
i
ca
seem
to
care
i
ca
seem
to
make
myself
feel
as
if
i
belonged
to
any
one
else
except
to
you
i
do
think
i
do
belong
to
any
one
else
i
was
born
over
in
the
wreck
i
was
born
yours
you
saved
me
i
would
have
died
if
you
had
gotten
me
out
from
under
the
beams
and
worked
over
and
brought
me
back
to
life
when
everybody
else
gave
me
up
as
dead
i
would
have
been
alive
for
my
husband
if
you
had
saved
me
i
am
yours
larry
if
you
want
me
to
marry
you
i
will
if
you
want
me
any
way
i
am
yours
i
love
you
ruth
larry
drew
her
into
his
arms
and
kissed
her
the
first
time
he
had
ever
kissed
any
girl
in
his
life
except
his
sister
she
lay
in
his
arms
her
fragrant
pale
gold
hair
brushing
his
cheek
he
kissed
her
over
and
over
passionately
almostly
roughly
in
the
storm
of
his
emotion
suddenly
unpent
then
he
was
larry
holiday
again
he
pushed
her
gently
from
him
remorse
in
his
gray
eyes
forgive
me
ruth
it
all
wrong
i
all
wrong
we
ca
do
it
i
should
have
kissed
you
i
should
have
touched
you
should
have
let
you
come
to
me
like
this
you
must
go
now
dear
i
am
sorry
ruth
faced
him
in
silence
a
moment
then
bowed
her
head
turned
and
walked
away
to
the
door
meekly
like
a
chidden
child
her
loosened
hair
fell
like
a
golden
shower
over
her
shoulders
it
was
all
larry
could
do
to
keep
from
going
after
her
taking
her
in
his
arms
again
but
he
stood
grimly
planted
by
the
table
gripping
its
edge
as
if
to
keep
himself
anchored
he
dared
not
stir
one
inch
toward
that
childish
figure
in
the
dark
robe
on
the
threshold
ruth
turned
flung
back
her
hair
and
looked
back
at
him
there
was
a
kind
of
fearless
exaltation
and
pride
on
her
lovely
young
face
and
in
her
shining
eyes
i
do
know
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
larry
or
rather
when
you
are
right
and
when
you
are
wrong
it
is
all
mixed
up
it
seems
as
if
it
must
be
right
to
care
or
we
would
be
doing
it
so
hard
as
if
god
could
let
us
love
like
this
if
he
did
mean
we
should
be
happy
together
belong
to
each
other
why
should
he
make
love
if
he
did
want
lovers
to
be
happy
it
was
an
argument
as
old
as
the
garden
of
eden
but
to
ruth
and
larry
it
was
as
if
it
were
being
pronounced
for
the
first
time
for
themselves
here
in
the
dead
of
night
in
the
old
house
on
the
hill
as
they
felt
themselves
drawn
to
each
other
by
the
all
but
irresistible
impulse
of
their
mutual
love
maybe
went
on
ruth
i
forgot
my
morals
along
with
the
rest
i
forgot
i
do
seem
to
care
very
much
about
right
and
wrong
you
called
me
i
heard
you
and
i
came
i
am
here
her
lovely
proud
little
head
was
thrown
back
her
eyes
still
shining
with
that
fearless
elation
ruth
do
dear
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
i
got
to
care
about
right
and
wrong
for
both
of
us
please
go
i
i
ca
stand
it
he
left
his
post
by
the
table
then
came
forward
and
held
open
the
door
for
her
she
passed
out
went
up
the
stairs
her
hair
falling
in
a
wave
of
gold
down
to
her
waist
she
did
not
turn
back
larry
waited
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
until
he
heard
the
door
of
her
room
close
upon
her
and
then
he
too
went
up
to
granny
room
ted
met
him
at
the
threshold
in
a
panic
of
fear
and
grief
larry
i
think
oh
and
ted
bolted
unable
to
finish
what
he
had
begun
to
say
or
to
linger
on
that
threshold
of
death
the
nurse
was
bending
over
madame
holiday
forcing
some
brandy
between
the
blue
lips
larry
was
by
the
bedside
in
an
instant
the
nurse
stepped
back
with
a
sad
little
shake
of
the
head
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
and
she
knew
it
knew
also
there
was
nothing
the
young
doctor
could
do
professionally
he
knelt
chafed
the
cold
hands
the
pale
lips
quivered
a
little
the
glazed
eyes
opened
for
a
second
ned
larry
give
philip
love
that
was
all
the
eyes
closed
there
was
a
little
flutter
of
passing
breath
granny
was
gone
it
was
two
days
after
granny
funeral
ted
had
gone
back
to
college
tony
would
leave
for
new
york
on
the
morrow
life
can
not
wait
on
death
it
must
go
on
its
course
as
inevitably
as
a
river
must
go
its
way
to
the
sea
yet
to
tony
it
seemed
sad
and
heartless
that
it
should
be
so
she
was
troubled
by
her
selfishness
first
to
granny
living
and
now
to
granny
dead
she
said
as
much
to
her
uncle
sorrowfully
it
is
really
heartless
or
unkind
he
comforted
her
we
have
to
go
on
with
our
work
we
ca
lay
it
down
or
scamp
it
just
because
dear
granny
work
is
done
it
is
no
more
wrong
for
you
to
go
back
to
your
play
than
it
is
for
me
to
go
back
to
my
doctoring
i
know
sighed
tony
but
i
ca
help
feeling
remorseful
i
had
so
much
time
and
granny
had
so
little
and
yet
i
was
willing
to
give
her
even
a
little
of
mine
i
would
have
if
i
had
known
though
i
knew
i
was
selfish
but
i
did
know
how
selfish
i
wish
you
had
told
me
uncle
phil
why
did
you
you
told
ruth
you
let
her
help
why
would
you
let
me
she
half
reproached
i
tried
to
do
what
was
best
for
us
all
i
wanted
to
find
a
reason
for
keeping
ruth
with
us
and
i
did
not
think
then
and
i
do
think
now
that
it
was
right
or
necessary
to
keep
you
back
for
the
little
comfort
it
could
have
brought
to
granny
you
must
not
worry
dear
child
the
blame
if
there
is
any
is
mine
i
know
you
would
have
stayed
if
i
had
let
you
back
in
college
ted
sorted
out
his
personal
letters
from
the
sheaf
of
bills
among
them
was
one
from
madeline
taylor
presumably
the
answer
to
the
one
ted
had
written
her
from
the
house
on
the
hill
he
stared
at
the
envelope
dreading
to
open
it
he
was
too
horribly
afraid
of
what
it
might
contain
suddenly
he
threw
the
letter
down
on
the
table
and
his
head
went
down
on
top
of
it
i
ca
do
it
he
groaned
i
ca
i
wo
it
too
hard
but
in
a
moment
his
head
popped
up
again
fiercely
confound
you
he
muttered
you
can
and
you
will
you
got
to
you
made
your
bed
now
lie
on
it
and
he
opened
the
letter
i
ca
tell
you
wrote
the
girl
how
your
letter
touched
me
think
i
do
understand
that
it
is
because
you
love
me
or
really
want
to
marry
me
that
you
are
asking
me
to
do
it
it
is
all
the
finer
and
more
wonderful
because
you
do
and
could
ever
you
had
nothing
to
gain
everything
to
lose
yet
you
offered
it
all
as
if
it
were
the
most
ordinary
gift
in
the
world
instead
of
the
biggest
of
course
i
ca
let
you
sacrifice
yourself
like
that
for
me
did
you
really
think
i
would
i
would
let
you
be
dragged
down
into
my
life
even
if
you
loved
me
which
you
do
some
day
you
will
want
to
marry
a
girl
not
somebody
like
me
but
your
own
kind
and
you
can
go
to
her
clean
because
you
never
hurt
me
never
did
me
anything
but
good
ever
you
lifted
me
up
always
but
there
must
have
been
something
still
stronger
that
pulled
me
down
i
could
stay
up
i
was
never
your
kind
though
i
loved
you
just
as
much
as
if
i
were
forgive
my
saying
it
just
this
once
it
will
be
the
last
time
this
is
really
thank
you
over
and
over
for
everything
madeline
a
mist
blurred
ted
holiday
eyes
as
he
finished
the
letter
he
was
free
the
black
winged
vulture
thing
which
had
hovered
over
him
for
days
was
gone
by
and
by
he
would
be
thankful
for
his
deliverance
but
just
now
there
was
room
only
in
his
chivalrous
boy
heart
for
one
overmastering
emotion
pity
for
the
girl
and
her
needlessly
wrecked
life
what
a
hopeless
mess
the
whole
thing
was
and
what
could
he
do
to
help
her
since
she
would
not
take
what
he
had
offered
in
all
sincerity
he
must
think
out
a
way
somehow
chapter
xxix
the
pedigree
of
pearls
where
is
larry
asked
doctor
holiday
a
few
days
later
coming
into
the
dining
room
at
supper
time
i
have
seen
him
all
the
afternoon
margery
dropped
into
her
chair
with
a
tired
little
sigh
there
is
a
note
from
him
at
your
place
i
think
he
has
gone
out
of
town
john
told
me
he
took
him
to
the
three
ten
train
h
m
mused
the
doctor
where
is
ruth
he
looked
up
to
ask
ruth
went
to
boston
at
noon
at
least
so
bertha
tells
me
bertha
was
the
maid
she
did
not
say
to
me
i
thought
possibly
she
had
to
you
her
husband
shook
his
head
perplexed
and
troubled
dear
uncle
phil
ran
larry
message
ruth
has
gone
to
boston
she
left
a
letter
for
me
saying
and
asking
me
to
say
to
the
rest
of
you
for
her
said
she
would
write
as
soon
as
she
had
an
address
and
that
no
one
was
to
worry
about
her
she
would
be
quite
all
right
and
thought
it
was
best
not
to
bother
us
by
telling
us
about
her
plans
until
she
was
settled
of
course
i
am
going
after
her
i
do
know
where
she
is
but
i
find
her
i
got
to
especially
as
i
was
the
one
who
drove
her
away
i
broke
my
promise
to
you
i
did
make
love
to
her
and
asked
her
to
marry
me
the
night
granny
died
she
said
she
would
and
then
of
course
i
said
she
could
and
we
not
seen
each
other
alone
since
so
i
do
know
what
she
thinks
now
i
do
know
anything
except
that
i
half
crazy
i
know
it
is
horribly
selfish
to
go
off
and
leave
you
like
this
when
you
need
me
especially
please
forgive
me
i
be
back
as
soon
as
i
can
or
send
ruth
or
we
both
come
and
do
worry
i
not
going
to
do
anything
rash
or
wrong
or
anything
that
will
hurt
you
or
ruth
i
am
sorry
about
the
other
night
i
did
mean
to
smash
up
like
that
the
doctor
handed
the
letter
over
to
his
wife
why
did
he
wait
until
he
had
her
address
how
can
he
possibly
find
her
in
a
city
like
boston
with
not
the
slightest
thing
to
go
on
doctor
holiday
smiled
wearily
wait
do
you
see
larry
waiting
when
ruth
is
out
of
his
sight
my
dear
do
you
know
larry
is
the
maddest
of
the
three
when
he
gets
under
way
the
maddest
and
the
finest
do
worry
phil
he
is
all
right
he
do
anything
rash
just
as
he
tells
you
you
ca
trust
a
man
in
love
especially
a
young
idiot
who
waited
a
full
quarter
century
to
get
the
disease
for
the
first
time
but
you
are
right
i
trust
him
anywhere
more
rather
than
less
because
of
that
confession
of
his
i
wondered
that
he
did
break
his
promise
long
before
this
he
is
only
human
and
his
restraint
has
been
pretty
nearly
i
do
believe
he
would
have
smashed
up
now
as
he
calls
it
if
his
nerves
had
been
strained
about
to
the
limit
by
taking
all
the
responsibility
for
granny
at
the
end
it
was
terrible
for
the
poor
lad
it
was
terrible
for
you
too
phil
larry
is
the
only
one
who
has
suffered
i
do
wish
those
foolish
youngsters
could
have
waited
a
little
and
not
thrown
a
new
anxiety
on
you
just
now
but
i
suppose
we
blame
them
under
the
circumstances
is
it
strange
dear
except
for
the
children
sleeping
up
in
the
nursery
you
and
i
are
absolutely
alone
for
the
first
time
since
i
came
to
the
house
on
the
hill
he
nodded
a
little
sadly
his
father
was
gone
long
since
and
now
granny
too
and
ned
children
were
all
grown
up
would
perhaps
none
of
them
ever
come
again
in
the
old
way
their
wings
were
strong
enough
now
to
make
strange
flights
we
filled
your
life
rather
full
margery
mine
he
said
i
hope
there
are
easier
days
ahead
i
do
want
any
happier
ones
said
margery
as
she
slipped
her
hand
into
his
the
next
few
days
were
a
perfect
nightmare
to
larry
naturally
he
found
no
trace
of
ruth
did
not
know
indeed
under
what
name
she
had
chosen
to
go
the
city
had
swallowed
her
up
and
the
saddest
part
of
it
was
she
had
wanted
to
be
swallowed
to
get
away
from
himself
she
had
gone
for
his
sake
he
knew
because
he
had
told
her
he
could
endure
things
no
longer
she
had
taken
him
at
his
word
and
vanished
utterly
for
all
her
gentleness
and
docility
ruth
had
tremendous
fortitude
she
had
taken
this
hard
rash
step
alone
in
the
dark
for
love
sake
just
as
she
was
ready
that
unforgettable
night
to
take
that
rasher
step
with
him
to
marriage
or
something
less
than
marriage
had
he
permitted
it
she
would
have
preferred
to
marry
him
not
to
bother
with
abstractions
of
right
and
wrong
to
take
happiness
as
it
offered
but
since
he
would
not
have
it
so
she
had
lost
herself
despair
remorse
anxiety
loneliness
held
thrall
while
he
roamed
the
streets
of
the
old
city
almost
hopeless
now
of
finding
her
but
still
doggedly
persistent
in
his
search
another
man
under
such
a
strain
of
mind
and
body
would
have
gone
on
a
stupendous
thought
drowning
carouse
larry
holiday
had
no
such
refuge
in
his
misery
he
took
it
straight
without
recourse
to
anaesthetic
of
any
sort
and
on
the
fourth
day
when
he
had
been
about
to
give
up
in
defeat
and
go
home
to
the
hill
to
wait
for
word
of
ruth
a
crack
of
light
dawned
chancing
to
be
strolling
absent
mindedly
across
the
gardens
he
ran
into
a
college
classmate
of
his
one
gary
eldridge
who
shook
his
hand
with
crushing
grip
and
announced
that
it
was
a
funny
thing
larry
bobbing
up
like
that
because
he
had
been
hearing
the
latter
name
pretty
consecutively
all
the
previous
afternoon
on
the
lips
of
the
daintiest
little
blonde
beauty
it
had
been
his
luck
to
behold
in
many
a
moon
a
regular
greuze
girl
in
fact
eyes
and
all
naturally
there
was
no
escape
for
eldridge
after
that
larry
holiday
grabbed
him
firmly
and
demanded
to
know
if
he
had
seen
ruth
annersley
and
if
he
had
and
knew
where
she
was
to
tell
him
everything
quick
it
was
important
considering
larry
holiday
haggard
face
and
tense
voice
eldridge
admitted
the
importance
and
spun
his
yarn
no
he
did
not
know
where
ruth
annersley
was
nor
if
the
greuze
girl
was
ruth
annersley
at
all
he
did
know
the
person
he
meant
was
in
the
possession
of
the
famous
farringdon
pearls
a
fact
immensely
interesting
to
fitch
and
larrabee
the
jewelers
in
whose
employ
he
was
your
ruth
annersley
or
farringdon
or
whoever
she
is
brought
the
pearls
in
to
our
place
yesterday
to
have
them
appraised
you
can
bet
we
sat
up
and
took
notice
we
did
know
they
had
left
australia
but
here
they
were
right
under
our
noses
absolutely
unmistakable
one
of
the
finest
sets
of
matched
pearls
in
the
world
you
holidays
are
so
hanged
smart
i
wonder
it
did
occur
to
you
to
bring
to
us
anyway
we
the
boys
that
can
tell
you
who
who
in
the
lapidary
world
pearls
have
pedigrees
my
dear
fellow
quite
as
faithfully
recorded
as
those
of
prize
pigs
larry
thumped
his
cranium
disgustedly
it
did
seem
ridiculous
now
that
the
very
simple
expedient
of
going
to
the
master
jewelers
for
information
had
not
struck
any
of
them
but
it
had
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
he
made
eldridge
sit
down
in
the
gardens
then
and
there
however
to
tell
him
all
he
knew
about
the
pearls
but
first
and
most
important
did
the
other
have
any
idea
where
the
owner
of
the
pearls
was
he
had
none
the
girl
was
coming
in
again
in
a
few
days
to
hear
the
result
of
a
cable
they
had
sent
to
australia
where
the
pearls
had
been
the
last
larrabee
and
fitch
knew
she
had
left
no
address
eldridge
rather
thought
she
had
cared
to
be
found
larry
bit
his
lip
at
that
and
groaned
inwardly
he
too
was
afraid
it
was
only
too
true
and
it
was
all
his
fault
this
was
the
story
of
the
pearls
as
his
friend
briefly
outlined
it
for
larry
holiday
benefit
the
farringdon
pearls
had
originally
belonged
to
a
lady
jane
farringdon
of
farringdon
court
england
they
had
been
the
gift
of
a
rejected
lover
who
had
gone
to
africa
to
drown
his
disappointment
and
had
died
there
after
having
sent
the
pearls
home
to
the
woman
he
had
loved
fruitlessly
and
who
was
by
this
time
the
wife
of
another
man
her
distant
cousin
sir
james
farringdon
at
her
death
lady
jane
had
given
the
pearls
to
her
oldest
son
for
his
bride
when
he
should
have
one
he
too
had
died
however
before
he
had
attained
to
the
bride
the
pearls
went
to
his
younger
brother
roderick
a
sheep
raiser
in
australia
who
had
amassed
a
fortune
and
discarded
the
title
the
sheep
raiser
married
an
australian
girl
and
gave
her
the
pearls
they
had
two
children
a
girl
and
a
boy
roderick
was
since
deceased
possibly
his
wife
also
was
dead
they
had
cabled
to
find
out
details
but
it
looked
as
if
the
little
blonde
lady
who
possessed
the
pearls
although
she
did
not
know
where
she
got
them
was
in
all
probability
the
daughter
of
roderick
farringdon
the
granddaughter
of
the
famous
beauty
lady
jane
she
was
probably
also
a
great
heiress
the
sheep
raiser
and
his
had
both
been
reported
to
be
wallowing
in
money
oh
boy
eldridge
had
ended
significantly
but
if
ruth
is
a
person
of
so
much
importance
why
did
they
let
her
travel
so
far
alone
with
those
valuable
pearls
in
her
possession
why
have
they
looked
her
up
i
suppose
she
told
you
about
the
wreck
and
the
rest
of
it
she
did
sang
the
praises
of
the
family
of
holiday
in
a
thousand
keys
your
advertisements
were
all
on
the
annersley
track
you
see
and
they
would
all
be
out
on
the
farringdon
one
the
paths
did
happen
to
cross
i
suppose
you
do
know
anything
about
geoffrey
annersley
do
you
larry
asked
anxiously
not
a
thing
we
are
jewelers
not
detectives
or
clairvoyants
it
is
only
the
pearls
we
are
up
on
and
we
evidently
slipped
a
cog
on
them
we
should
have
known
when
they
came
to
the
states
but
we
did
i
cable
the
american
consul
at
australia
myself
it
the
first
real
clue
we
have
had
the
rest
has
been
working
in
the
dark
the
first
thing
though
is
to
find
ruth
and
larry
holiday
looked
so
very
determined
and
capable
of
doing
anything
he
set
out
to
do
that
gary
eldridge
grinned
a
little
wonderful
what
falling
in
love
will
do
for
a
chap
he
reflected
used
to
think
old
larry
was
rather
a
slow
poke
but
he
seems
to
have
developed
into
some
whirlwind
do
wonder
considering
what
a
little
peach
the
girl
is
hope
the
good
lord
has
seen
fit
to
recall
geoffrey
annersley
to
his
heaven
if
he
really
did
marry
her
aloud
he
promised
to
telephone
larry
the
moment
the
owner
of
the
pearls
crossed
the
threshold
of
larrabee
and
fitch
and
to
hold
her
by
main
force
if
necessary
until
larry
could
get
there
in
the
meantime
he
suggested
that
she
had
seemed
awfully
interested
in
the
australia
part
of
the
story
and
it
was
very
possible
she
had
gone
to
the
library
larry
took
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
and
bolted
without
any
formality
of
farewell
into
the
nearest
subway
entrance
his
friend
gazed
after
him
and
this
is
larry
holiday
who
used
to
flee
if
a
skirt
fluttered
in
his
direction
he
murmured
ah
well
it
takes
us
differently
but
it
gets
us
all
sooner
or
later
larry
luck
had
turned
at
last
in
the
reading
room
of
the
public
library
he
discovered
a
familiar
blonde
head
bent
over
a
book
he
strode
to
the
secluded
corner
where
she
sat
reading
up
on
australia
ruth
larry
tried
to
speak
quietly
though
he
felt
like
raising
the
echoes
of
the
sacred
scholarly
precincts
the
reader
looked
up
startled
wondering
her
face
lit
with
quick
delight
larry
oh
larry
i
finding
myself
she
whispered
breathlessly
i
glad
but
i
gladder
that
i
finding
yourself
come
on
outside
sweetheart
i
want
to
shout
i
ca
whisper
and
i
wo
i
get
us
both
put
out
if
you
wo
come
peaceably
i
come
said
ruth
meekly
outside
in
the
corridor
she
raised
blue
eyes
to
gray
ones
i
did
mean
you
to
find
me
yet
she
sighed
so
i
should
judge
i
did
think
a
mite
of
a
fairy
girl
like
you
could
be
so
cruel
some
day
i
exact
full
penance
for
all
you
made
me
suffer
but
just
now
we
waive
that
and
go
over
to
the
plaza
and
have
a
high
tea
and
talk
but
first
i
going
to
kiss
you
i
do
care
if
people
are
looking
all
boston
can
look
if
it
likes
i
going
to
do
it
but
it
was
only
a
scrub
woman
and
not
all
boston
who
witnessed
that
kiss
and
she
paid
no
attention
to
the
performance
even
had
she
seen
it
is
hardly
probable
that
she
would
have
been
vastly
startled
at
the
sight
she
was
a
very
old
woman
and
more
than
likely
she
had
seen
such
sights
before
perhaps
she
had
even
been
kissed
by
a
man
herself
once
upon
a
time
we
hope
so
the
next
day
larry
and
ruth
came
home
to
the
hill
radiantly
happy
and
full
of
their
strange
adventures
ruth
was
wearing
an
immensely
becoming
new
dark
blue
velvet
suit
squirrel
furs
and
a
new
hat
which
to
shrewd
feminine
eyes
betrayed
a
cost
all
out
of
proportion
to
its
minuteness
she
was
looking
exquisitely
lovely
in
her
new
finery
scant
wonder
larry
could
not
keep
his
eyes
off
of
her
margery
and
philip
were
something
in
the
same
state
on
the
strength
of
my
being
an
heiress
maybe
larry
thought
i
might
afford
some
new
clothes
ruth
confessed
of
course
he
paid
for
them
temporarily
she
had
added
with
a
charming
blush
and
a
side
long
deprecating
glance
at
doctor
holiday
senior
she
did
not
want
him
to
disapprove
of
her
for
letting
larry
buy
her
pretty
clothes
nor
blame
larry
for
doing
it
but
he
only
laughed
and
remarked
that
he
would
have
gone
shopping
with
her
himself
if
he
had
any
idea
the
results
would
be
so
satisfactory
it
was
only
when
he
was
alone
with
margery
that
he
shook
his
head
those
crazy
children
behave
as
if
everything
were
quite
all
right
and
as
if
they
could
run
right
out
any
minute
and
get
married
she
does
even
wear
her
ring
any
more
and
they
both
appear
to
think
the
fact
it
presumably
represents
can
be
disposed
of
as
summarily
let
them
alone
advised
his
wife
they
are
all
right
it
wo
do
them
a
bit
of
harm
to
let
themselves
go
a
bit
larry
does
his
worshiping
with
his
eyes
and
maybe
with
his
tongue
when
they
are
alone
i
do
blame
him
she
is
a
perfect
darling
and
it
is
much
better
for
him
not
to
pretend
he
does
care
when
we
all
know
he
does
tremendously
it
was
crushing
it
all
back
that
made
him
so
miserable
and
smash
up
as
he
wrote
you
i
do
believe
he
smashed
very
irretrievably
anyway
he
is
too
much
of
a
holiday
the
doctor
smiled
a
little
grimly
you
honor
us
my
dear
even
holidays
are
men
thank
heaven

chapter
xxx
the
fiery
furnace
a
few
days
after
the
return
of
larry
and
ruth
to
the
hill
doctor
holiday
found
among
his
mail
an
official
looking
document
bearing
the
seal
of
the
college
which
ted
attended
and
which
was
also
his
own
and
larry
alma
mater
he
opened
it
carelessly
supposing
it
to
be
an
alumni
appeal
of
some
sort
but
as
ran
down
the
typed
sheet
his
face
grew
grave
and
his
lips
set
in
a
tight
line
the
communication
was
from
the
president
and
informed
its
recipient
that
his
nephew
edward
holiday
was
expelled
from
the
college
on
the
confessed
charge
of
gambling
we
are
particularly
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
take
this
action
wrote
the
president
inasmuch
as
edward
has
shown
recently
a
marked
improvement
both
in
work
and
general
conduct
which
has
gone
far
to
eradicate
the
unfortunate
impression
made
by
the
lawlessness
of
his
earlier
career
but
we
can
not
overlook
so
flagrant
an
offense
and
are
regretfully
forced
to
make
an
example
of
the
offender
as
you
know
gambling
is
strictly
against
the
rules
of
the
institution
and
your
nephew
played
deliberately
for
high
stakes
as
he
admits
and
made
a
considerable
sum
of
money
three
hundred
dollars
to
be
precise
which
he
disposed
of
immediately
for
what
purpose
he
refuses
to
tell
again
regretting
et
cetera
et

the
letter
closed
but
there
was
also
a
hand
written
postscript
and
an
enclosure
the
postscript
ran
as
follows
as
a
personal
friend
and
not
as
the
president
of
the
college
i
am
sending
on
the
enclosed
which
may
or
may
not
be
of
importance
a
young
girl
madeline
taylor
by
name
of
florence
massachusetts
who
has
until
recently
been
employed
in
berry
flower
shop
was
found
dead
this
morning
with
the
gas
jet
fully
turned
on
the
inference
being
clearly
suicide
a
short
time
ago
a
servant
from
the
lodging
house
where
the
dead
girl
resided
came
to
me
with
a
letter
addressed
to
your
nephew
it
seems
miss
taylor
had
given
the
girl
the
letter
to
mail
the
previous
evening
and
had
indeed
made
a
considerable
point
of
its
being
mailed
nevertheless
the
girl
had
forgotten
to
do
so
and
the
next
day
was
too
frightened
to
do
it
fearing
the
thing
might
have
some
connection
with
the
suicide
she
meant
to
give
it
to
ted
in
person
but
finding
him
out
decided
at
the
last
moment
to
deliver
it
to
me
instead
i
am
sending
the
letter
to
you
as
i
received
it
unopened
and
have
not
and
shall
not
mention
the
incident
to
any
one
else
i
should
prefer
and
am
sure
that
you
will
also
wish
that
your
nephew
name
shall
not
be
associated
in
any
way
with
the
dead
girl
frankly
i
do
believe
the
thing
contains
any
dynamite
whatever
but
i
would
rather
you
handled
the
thing
instead
of
myself
believe
me
my
dear
holiday
i
am
heartily
sick
and
sorry
over
the
whole
matter
of
ted
expulsion
if
we
had
not
had
his
own
word
for
it
i
should
not
have
believed
him
guilty
even
now
i
have
a
feeling
that
there
was
more
behind
the
thing
than
we
got
something
perhaps
more
to
his
credit
than
he
was
willing
to
tell
philip
holiday
picked
up
the
enclosed
letter
addressed
to
ted
and
looked
at
it
as
dubiously
as
if
indeed
it
might
have
contained
dynamite
the
scrawling
handwriting
was
painfully
familiar
and
the
mention
of
florence
as
the
dead
girl
home
was
disagreeably
corroborating
evidence
what
indeed
was
behind
it
all
steeling
his
will
he
tore
open
the
sealed
envelope
save
for
a
folded
slip
of
paper
it
was
quite
empty
the
folded
slip
was
a
check
for
three
hundred
dollars
made
payable
to
madeline
taylor
and
signed
with
ted
holiday
name
here
was
dynamite
and
to
spare
for
doctor
holiday
beside
the
uneasy
questions
this
development
conjured
the
catastrophe
of
the
expulsion
took
second
place
and
yet
he
forced
himself
not
to
judge
until
he
had
heard
ted
own
story
what
was
love
for
if
it
could
not
find
faith
in
time
of
need
he
said
nothing
to
any
one
even
his
wife
of
the
president
letter
and
that
disconcerting
check
which
evidently
represented
the
results
of
the
boy
law
breaking
all
day
he
looked
for
a
letter
from
ted
himself
and
hoped
against
hope
that
he
would
appear
in
person
his
anxiety
grew
as
he
heard
nothing
what
had
become
of
the
boy
where
had
he
betaken
himself
with
his
shame
and
trouble
how
grave
was
his
trouble
it
was
a
bad
day
for
philip
holiday
and
a
worse
night
but
the
morning
brought
a
letter
from
his
nephew
mailed
ominously
enough
from
a
railway
post
office
in
northern
vermont
the
doctor
tore
it
open
with
hands
that
trembled
a
little
one
thing
at
least
he
was
certain
of
however
bad
the
story
the
lad
had
to
tell
it
would
be
the
truth
he
could
count
on
that
dear
uncle
phil
it
ran
by
the
time
you
get
this
i
shall
be
over
the
border
and
enlisted
i
hope
with
the
canadians
i
am
horribly
sorry
to
knife
you
like
this
and
go
off
without
saying
and
leaving
such
a
mess
behind
but
truly
it
is
the
best
thing
i
could
do
for
the
rest
of
you
as
well
as
myself
they
will
write
you
from
college
and
tell
you
i
am
fired
for
gambling
but
they
wo
tell
you
the
whole
story
because
they
do
know
it
i
could
tell
them
it
concerned
somebody
else
besides
myself
but
you
have
a
right
to
know
everything
and
i
am
going
to
tell
it
to
you
and
there
wo
be
anything
shaved
off
or
tacked
on
to
save
my
face
either
it
will
be
straight
stuff
on
my
honor
as
a
holiday
which
means
as
much
to
me
as
it
does
to
you
and
larry
whether
you
believe
it
or
not
then
followed
a
straightforward
account
of
events
from
the
first
on
the
train
and
the
all
but
fatal
joy
ride
to
the
equally
kisses
in
cousin
emma
garden
i
hate
like
the
mischief
to
put
such
things
down
on
paper
wrote
the
boy
but
i
said
i
tell
the
whole
thing
and
i
will
even
if
it
does
come
out
hard
so
you
will
know
it
is
any
worse
than
it
is
it
is
bad
enough
i
admit
i
had
any
business
to
make
fool
love
to
her
when
i
really
did
care
a
picayune
and
i
had
any
business
to
be
there
in
holyoke
at
all
when
you
thought
i
was
at
hal
i
did
go
to
hal
but
i
only
stayed
two
days
the
rest
of
the
time
i
was
with
madeline
and
knew
i
was
going
to
be
when
i
left
the
hill
that
part
ca
look
any
worse
to
you
than
it
does
to
me
it
was
a
trick
to
play
on
you
when
you
had
been
so
white
about
the
car
and
everything
but
i
did
it
and
i
undo
it
i
can
only
say
i
am
sorry
i
did
try
afterward
to
make
up
a
little
bit
by
keeping
my
word
about
the
studying
maybe
you
let
that
count
a
little
on
the
other
side
of
the
ledger
lord
knows
i
need
anything
i
can
get
there
it
is
little
enough
more
shame
to
me
then
followed
the
events
of
the
immediately
preceding
months
from
madeline
taylor
arrival
in
the
college
town
on
to
the
stunning
revelation
of
old
doctor
hendricks
letter
you
do
know
how
the
thing
made
me
feel
i
could
help
feeling
more
or
less
responsible
for
after
all
i
did
start
the
thing
and
though
madeline
was
always
too
good
a
sport
to
blame
me
i
knew
and
i
am
sure
she
knew
that
she
would
have
taken
up
with
hubbard
if
i
had
left
her
in
the
lurch
just
when
she
had
gotten
to
care
a
whole
lot
too
much
for
me
besides
i
could
help
thinking
what
it
would
have
been
like
if
tony
had
been
caught
in
a
trap
like
that
it
did
seem
to
me
i
could
stand
off
and
let
her
go
to
smash
alone
though
i
could
see
doc
hendricks
had
common
sense
on
his
side
when
he
ordered
me
to
keep
out
of
the
whole
business
i
had
all
this
on
my
mind
when
i
came
home
that
last
time
when
granny
was
dying
i
had
it
lodged
in
my
head
that
it
was
up
to
me
to
straighten
things
out
by
marrying
madeline
myself
though
i
hated
the
idea
like
death
and
destruction
and
i
knew
it
would
about
kill
the
rest
of
you
i
wrote
and
asked
her
to
marry
me
that
night
after
granny
went
she
would
do
it
it
was
because
she
did
love
me
either
i
guess
it
was
rather
because
she
did
that
she
would
she
would
pull
me
down
in
the
quick
sands
with
her
whatever
you
may
think
of
what
she
was
and
did
you
will
have
to
admit
that
she
was
magnificent
about
this
she
might
have
saved
herself
at
my
expense
and
she
would
remember
that
uncle
phil
and
do
judge
her
about
the
rest
doctor
holiday
ceased
reading
a
moment
and
gazed
into
the
fire
by
the
measure
of
his
full
realization
of
what
such
a
marriage
would
have
meant
to
his
young
nephew
he
paid
homage
to
the
girl
in
her
fine
courage
in
refusing
to
take
advantage
of
a
chivalrous
boy
impulsive
generosity
even
though
it
left
her
the
terrible
alternative
which
later
she
had
taken
and
he
thought
with
a
tender
little
smile
that
there
was
something
also
rather
magnificent
about
a
lad
who
would
offer
himself
thus
voluntarily
and
knowingly
a
living
sacrifice
for
dear
honor
sake
he
went
back
to
the
letter
but
i
still
felt
i
had
to
do
something
to
help
though
she
accept
the
way
i
first
offered
i
knew
she
needed
money
badly
as
she
was
able
to
work
and
i
wanted
to
give
her
some
of
mine
i
knew
i
had
plenty
or
would
have
next
spring
when
i
came
of
age
but
i
was
sure
you
would
let
me
have
any
of
it
now
without
knowing
why
and
larry
lend
me
any
either
sight
unseen
i
would
have
blamed
either
of
you
for
refusing
i
have
deserved
to
be
taken
on
trust
the
only
other
way
i
knew
of
to
get
money
quick
was
to
play
for
it
i
have
fool
luck
always
at
cards
last
year
i
played
a
lot
for
money
larry
knew
and
rowed
me
like
the
devil
for
it
last
spring
no
wonder
he
knew
how
dad
hated
it
so
did
i
heard
him
rave
on
the
subject
often
enough
but
i
did
it
just
the
same
as
i
did
a
good
many
other
things
i
am
not
very
proud
to
remember
now
but
i
have
done
it
this
year
at
least
only
a
few
times
once
i
played
when
i
sent
madeline
all
the
money
i
had
for
her
traveling
expenses
and
once
or
twice
beside
i
did
it
on
my
own
account
because
i
was
so
darned
sick
of
toeing
a
chalk
mark
i
had
to
go
on
a
tangent
or
bust
i
am
not
excusing
it
i
am
not
excusing
anything
i
am
just
telling
the
truth
anyhow
the
other
night
i
played
again
in
good
earnest
there
were
quite
a
number
of
fellows
in
the
game
and
we
all
got
a
bit
excited
and
plunged
more
than
we
meant
to
especially
myself
and
ned
delany
who
was
out
to
get
me
if
he
could
he
hates
me
like
the
seven
year
itch
anyway
because
i
caught
him
cheating
at
cards
once
and
said
so
right
out
in
meeting
i
had
absolutely
incredible
luck
i
guess
the
devil
or
the
angels
were
on
my
side
i
swept
everything
made
about
three
hundred
dollars
in
all
the
fellows
paid
up
and
i
banked
the
stuff
and
mailed
madeline
a
check
for
the
whole
amount
the
first
thing
i
do
know
what
would
have
happened
if
i
had
lost
instead
of
winning
i
did
think
about
that
a
true
gambler
never
does
i
reckon
but
i
want
to
say
right
here
and
now
uncle
phil
that
i
am
through
with
the
business
the
other
night
sickened
me
of
gambling
for
good
and
all
even
dad
could
have
hated
it
any
more
than
i
do
this
minute
it
is
rotten
for
a
man
kills
his
nerves
and
his
morals
and
his
common
sense
i
done
i
never
make
another
penny
that
way
as
long
as
i
live
but
i
not
sorry
i
did
it
this
once
no
matter
how
hard
i
paying
for
it
if
i
had
it
to
do
over
again
i
do
precisely
the
same
thing
i
wonder
if
you
can
understand
that
uncle
phil
or
whether
you
think
i
just
plain
unregenerate
i
thought
then
i
was
finished
with
the
business
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
just
starting
on
it
somebody
turned
state
evidence
i
imagine
it
was
delany
though
i
do
know
anyhow
somebody
wrote
the
president
an
anonymous
letter
telling
him
there
was
a
lot
of
gambling
going
on
and
i
was
one
of
the
worst
offenders
and
thoughtfully
suggested
the
old
boy
should
ask
me
how
much
i
made
the
other
night
and
what
i
did
with
it
of
course
that
finished
me
off
i
was
called
before
the
board
and
put
through
a
holy
inquisition
gee
they
piled
up
not
only
the
gambling
business
but
all
the
other
things
i
done
and
left
undone
for
two
years
and
a
half
and
dumped
the
whole
avalanche
on
my
head
at
once
whew
it
was
fierce
i
am
not
saying
i
did
deserve
it
i
did
if
not
for
this
particular
thing
for
a
million
other
times
when
i
gone
they
tried
to
squeeze
out
of
me
who
the
other
men
involved
were
but
i
would
tell
i
could
have
had
a
neat
little
come
back
on
delany
if
i
had
chosen
but
i
do
play
the
game
that
way
and
i
reckon
he
knew
it
and
banked
on
my
holding
my
tongue
i
rather
stand
alone
and
take
what
was
coming
to
me
and
i
got
it
too
good
and
plenty
they
tried
to
make
me
tell
what
i
did
with
the
money
that
riled
me
it
was
none
of
their
business
and
i
told
so
anyway
i
could
have
told
even
if
it
would
have
done
me
any
good
on
madeline
account
i
would
drag
her
into
it
finally
they
dismissed
me
and
said
they
would
let
me
know
later
what
they
would
do
about
my
case
but
there
was
any
doubt
in
my
mind
what
they
were
going
to
do
nor
in
theirs
either
i
bet
i
was
damned
they
had
to
fire
me
could
help
it
when
i
was
caught
with
the
goods
under
their
very
noses
i
think
a
good
many
of
them
wished
i
had
been
caught
that
they
could
have
let
me
off
some
way
particularly
hathaway
he
put
out
his
hand
and
patted
my
shoulder
when
i
went
out
and
i
knew
he
was
mighty
sorry
he
has
been
awfully
decent
to
me
always
especially
since
i
have
been
playing
round
with
his
daughter
elsie
this
fall
and
i
guess
it
made
him
feel
bad
to
have
me
turn
out
such
a
black
sheep
i
wished
i
could
tell
him
the
whole
story
but
i
could
i
just
had
to
let
him
think
it
was
as
bad
as
it
looked
i
had
hardly
gotten
back
into
the
frat
house
when
i
was
called
to
the
telephone
it
was
madeline
she
thanked
me
for
sending
her
the
money
but
said
she
was
sending
the
check
back
as
she
did
need
it
had
found
a
way
out
of
her
difficulties
she
was
going
on
a
long
long
journey
in
fact
and
would
see
me
again
said
she
wanted
to
say
and
wish
me
all
kinds
of
luck
and
thank
me
for
what
she
was
pleased
to
call
my
goodness
to
her
and
then
she
hung
up
before
i
could
ask
any
questions
or
get
it
through
my
head
what
she
meant
by
her
long
long
journey
my
brain
was
working
very
lively
after
what
i
been
through
over
there
at
the
board
meeting
anyway
and
i
was
too
wrapped
up
in
my
own
troubles
to
bother
much
about
hers
at
the
moment
selfish
brute
that
i
am
but
the
next
morning
i
understood
all
right
she
had
found
her
way
out
and
no
mistake
just
turned
on
the
gas
and
let
herself
go
she
was
dead
when
they
found
her
i
do
blame
her
uncle
phil
it
was
too
hard
for
her
she
could
go
through
with
it
life
had
been
too
hard
for
her
from
the
beginning
she
never
had
half
a
chance
and
in
the
end
we
killed
her
between
us
her
pious
old
psalm
singing
hypocrite
of
a
grandfather
the
rotter
who
ruined
her
and
myself
the
prince
of
fools
i
went
to
see
her
with
the
old
doc
and
uncle
phil
she
was
beautiful
not
even
granny
looked
more
peaceful
and
happy
than
she
did
lying
there
dead
with
the
little
smile
on
her
lips
as
if
she
were
having
a
pleasant
dream
but
the
scar
was
there
on
her
forehead
the
scar
i
put
there
got
a
scar
of
my
own
too
it
does
show
on
the
surface
but
it
is
there
for
all
that
and
always
will
be
i
sha
talk
about
it
but
i
never
forget
as
long
as
i
live
that
part
of
the
debt
she
paid
was
mine
it
is
for
me
always
so
far
as
she
is
concerned
her
grandfather
arrived
while
i
was
there
if
ever
there
was
a
man
broken
mind
and
body
and
spirit
he
was
i
could
help
feeling
sorry
for
him
of
the
two
i
would
much
rather
have
been
madeline
lying
there
dead
than
that
poor
old
chap
living
with
her
death
on
his
conscience
later
i
got
my
official
notice
from
the
board
i
was
fired
i
wanted
to
get
out
of
college
i
out
for
better
or
worse
uncle
phil
do
think
i
do
care
i
know
how
terribly
you
are
going
to
be
hurt
and
that
it
will
be
just
about
the
finish
of
poor
old
larry
i
am
not
very
proud
of
it
myself
being
catapulted
out
in
disgrace
where
the
rest
of
you
left
trailing
clouds
of
glory
it
is
only
what
i
have
done
just
now
it
is
all
the
things
i
have
done
and
have
done
before
that
has
smashed
me
in
the
end
my
fool
attitude
of
have
a
good
time
and
damn
the
expense
i
did
pay
at
the
time
i
am
paying
now
compound
interest
accumulated
worst
of
it
is
the
rest
of
you
will
have
to
pay
with
me
you
told
me
once
we
could
live
to
ourselves
alone
i
did
understand
then
i
do
now
i
am
guilty
but
you
have
to
suffer
with
me
for
my
mistakes
it
is
that
that
hurts
worst
of
all
you
have
been
wonderful
to
me
always
had
oceans
of
patience
when
i
disappointed
you
and
hurt
you
and
worried
you
over
and

chapter

the
moving
finger
continues
to
write
having
read
and
reread
the
boy
letter
doctor
holiday
sat
long
with
it
in
his
hand
staring
into
the
fire
poor
teddy
for
whom
life
had
hitherto
been
one
grand
and
glorious
festival
he
was
getting
the
other
the
seamy
side
of
things
at
last
with
a
vengeance
knowing
with
the
sure
intuition
of
love
how
deeply
the
boy
was
suffering
and
how
sincerely
he
repented
his
blunders
the
doctor
felt
far
more
compassion
than
condemnation
for
his
nephew
the
fineness
and
the
folly
of
the
thing
were
so
inextricably
confused
that
there
was
little
use
trying
to
separate
the
two
even
if
he
had
cared
to
judge
the
lad
which
he
did
not
being
content
with
the
own
judgment
of
himself
bad
as
the
gambling
business
was
and
deeply
as
he
regretted
the
expulsion
from
college
the
doctor
could
not
help
seeing
that
there
was
some
extenuation
for
ted
conduct
that
he
had
in
the
main
kept
faith
with
himself
paid
generously
far
more
than
he
owed
and
traveling
through
the
fiery
furnace
had
somehow
managed
to
come
out
unscathed
his
soul
intact
after
all
could
one
ask
much
more
it
was
considerably
harder
for
larry
to
accept
the
situation
philosophically
than
it
was
for
the
senior
doctor
more
tolerant
and
mature
mind
larry
loved
ted
as
he
loved
no
one
else
in
the
world
not
perhaps
even
excepting
ruth
but
he
loved
the
holiday
name
too
with
a
fine
high
pride
and
it
was
a
bitter
dose
to
swallow
to
have
his
younger
brother
catapulted
in
disgrace
as
ted
himself
put
it
out
of
the
college
which
he
himself
so
loved
and
honored
he
was
inclined
to
resent
what
looked
in
retrospect
as
entirely
unnecessary
and
uncalled
for
generosity
on
ted
part
nobody
but
ted
would
ever
have
thought
of
doing
such
a
fool
thing
he
groaned
why
did
he
pull
out
in
the
first
place
as
hendricks
wanted
him
to
he
would
have
been
entirely
justified
but
the
older
man
smiled
and
shook
his
head
some
people
could
have
done
it
not
ted
he
said
ted
is
built
that
way
he
never
deserted
anybody
in
trouble
in
his
life
i
do
believe
he
ever
will
we
ca
expect
him
to
have
behaved
differently
in
this
one
affair
just
because
we
would
have
liked
it
better
so
i
am
not
sure
but
we
would
be
wrong
and
he
right
in
any
case
maybe
but
it
is
a
horrible
mess
i
ca
get
over
the
injustice
of
the
poor
kid
paying
so
hard
when
he
was
just
trying
to
do
the
decent
hard
right
thing
you
have
it
less
straight
than
ted
has
larry
he
knows
he
is
paying
not
for
what
he
did
and
thought
right
but
for
what
he
did
and
knew
was
wrong
you
ca
feel
worse
than
i
do
about
it
i
would
give
anything
i
have
to
save
ted
from
the
torture
he
is
going
through
has
been
going
through
alone
for
days
but
i
would
rather
he
learned
his
lesson
thoroughly
now
suffering
more
than
he
deserves
than
have
him
suffer
too
little
and
fall
worse
next
time
no
matter
how
badly
we
feel
for
him
i
think
it
is
up
to
us
not
to
try
to
dilute
his
penitence
and
to
leave
a
generous
share
of
the
blame
where
he
puts
it
himself
on
his
own
shoulders
i
suppose
you
are
right
uncle
phil
sighed
larry
you
usually
are
but
it
like
having
a
piece
taken
right
out
of
me
to
have
him
go
off
like
that
and
the
canadians
are
the
very
devil
of
fighters
always
in
the
thick
of
things
that
is
where
ted
would
want
to
be
larry
let
us
not
cross
that
bridge
until
we
have
to
as
he
says
himself
there
are
worse
things
than
death
anyway
i
know
marrying
the
girl
would
have
been
worse
she
was
rather
magnificent
was
she
just
as
he
says
not
saving
herself
when
she
might
have
at
his
expense
i
think
she
was
i
am
almost
glad
the
poor
child
is
where
she
can
suffer
no
more
at
the
hands
of
men
the
next
day
came
a
wire
from
ted
announcing
his
acceptance
in
the
canadian
army
and
giving
his
address
in
the
training
camp
the
doctor
answered
at
once
writing
a
long
cheerful
letter
full
of
home
news
especially
the
interesting
developments
in
ruth
romantic
story
it
was
only
at
the
end
that
he
referred
to
the
big
thing
that
had
to
be
faced
between
them
i
am
not
going
to
say
a
word
that
will
add
in
any
way
to
the
burden
you
are
already
carrying
teddy
my
lad
you
know
how
sadly
disappointed
we
all
are
in
your
having
to
leave
college
this
way
but
i
understand
and
sympathize
fully
with
your
reasons
for
doing
what
you
did
even
though
i
ca
approve
of
the
thing
itself
i
have
a
single
reproach
to
offer
you
have
had
a
harsh
lesson
learn
it
so
well
that
you
will
never
bring
yourself
or
the
rest
of
us
to
such
pain
and
shame
again
keep
your
scar
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
you
were
so
callous
that
you
could
pass
through
an
experience
like
that
without
carrying
off
an
indelible
mark
from
it
but
it
is
going
to
ruin
your
life
on
the
contrary
it
is
going
to
make
a
man
of
you
is
doing
that
already
if
i
may
judge
from
the
spirit
of
your
letter
which
goes
far
to
atone
for
the
rest
the
forgiveness
is
yours
always
son
seventy
times
seven
if
need
be
never
doubt
it
we
shall
miss
you
very
much
i
wonder
if
you
know
how
dear
to
us
you
are
teddy
lad
but
we
are
going
to
borrow
trouble
of
the
future
we
shall
say
instead
god
speed
may
he
watch
over
you
wherever
you
are
and
bring
you
safe
back
to
us
in
his
good
time
and
ted
reading
the
letter
later
in
the
canadian
training
camp
was
not
ashamed
of
the
tears
that
came
stinging
up
in
his
eyes
he
was
woefully
homesick
wanted
the
home
people
especially
uncle
phil
desperately
but
the
message
from
the
hill
brought
strength
and
comfort
as
well
as
heart
ache
dear
uncle
phil
he
thought
i
will
make
it
up
to
him
somehow
i
will
he
sha
ever
have
to
be
ashamed
of
me
again
and
so
ted
holiday
girded
on
manhood
along
with
his
khaki
and
his
sam
browne
belt
and
started
bravely
up
out
of
the
pit
which
his
own
willful
folly
had
dug
for
him
tony
was
not
told
the
full
story
of
her
brother
fiasco
she
only
knew
that
he
had
left
college
for
some
reason
or
other
and
had
taken
french
leave
for
the
canadian
training
camp
she
was
relieved
to
discover
that
even
in
larry
stern
eyes
the
escapade
whatever
it
was
had
not
apparently
been
a
very
damaging
one
and
accepted
thankfully
her
uncle
assurance
that
there
was
nothing
at
all
to
worry
about
and
that
ted
was
no
doubt
very
much
better
off
where
he
was
than
if
he
had
stayed
in
college
as
for
the
going
to
war
part
small
blame
had
she
for
ted
in
that
she
knew
well
it
was
precisely
what
she
would
have
done
herself
in
his
case
and
teemed
with
pride
in
her
bonny
reckless
beloved
soldier
brother
she
had
small
time
to
think
much
about
anybody
affairs
beside
her
own
just
now
any
day
now
might
come
the
word
that
little
cecilia
had
gone
and
that
tony
holiday
would
take
her
place
on
the
broadway
stage
as
a
real
star
if
only
for
a
brief
space
of
twinkling
she
saw
very
little
even
of
alan
he
was
tremendously
busy
and
seemed
oddly
enough
to
be
drawing
a
little
away
from
her
to
be
less
jealously
exacting
of
her
time
and
attention
it
was
not
that
he
cared
less
rather
more
tony
thought
his
strange
tragic
eyes
rested
hungrily
upon
her
whenever
they
were
together
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
drink
deep
of
her
youth
and
loveliness
and
joy
a
draught
deep
enough
to
last
a
long
long
time
through
days
of
parching
thirst
to
follow
he
was
very
gentle
very
quiet
very
loveable
very
tender
his
stormy
mood
seemed
to
have
passed
over
leaving
a
great
weariness
in
its
wake
a
very
passion
of
creation
was
upon
him
seeing
the
canvases
that
flowered
into
beauty
beneath
his
hand
tony
felt
very
small
and
humble
knew
that
by
comparison
with
her
lover
genius
her
own
facile
gifts
were
but
as
a
firefly
glow
to
the
light
of
a
flaming
torch
he
was
of
the
masters
she
saw
that
and
was
proud
and
glad
and
awed
by
the
fact
but
she
saw
also
that
the
artist
was
consuming
himself
by
the
very
fire
of
his
own
genius
and
the
knowledge
troubled
her
though
she
saw
no
way
to
check
or
prevent
the
holocaust
if
such
it
was
sometimes
she
was
afraid
she
knew
that
she
would
never
be
happy
in
the
every
day
way
with
alan
happiness
did
not
grow
in
his
sunless
garden
married
to
him
she
would
enter
dark
forests
which
were
not
her
natural
environment
but
it
did
not
matter
she
loved
him
she
came
always
back
to
that
she
was
his
would
always
be
his
no
matter
what
happened
she
was
bound
by
the
past
caught
in
its
meshes
forever
and
then
suddenly
a
new
turn
of
the
wheel
took
place
word
came
just
before
christmas
that
dick
carson
was
very
ill
dying
perhaps
down
in
mexico
stricken
with
a
malarial
fever
a
few
moments
after
tony
received
this
stunning
news
alan
massey
card
was
brought
to
her
she
went
down
to
the
reception
room
gave
him
a
limp
cold
little
hand
in
greeting
and
asked
if
he
minded
going
out
with
her
she
had
to
talk
with
him
she
could
talk
here
alan
did
not
mind
a
little
later
they
were
walking
riverward
toward
a
brilliant
orange
sky
against
which
the
soldiers
and
sailors
monument
loomed
gray
and
majestic
it
was
bitter
cold
a
stinging
wind
lashed
the
girl
skirts
around
her
and
bit
into
her
cheeks
but
somehow
she
welcomed
the
physical
discomfort
it
matched
her
mood
then
the
story
came
out
dick
was
sick
very
sick
going
to
die
maybe
and
she
tony
holiday
could
stand
it
alan
listened
in
tense
silence
so
dick
carson
might
be
going
to
be
so
unexpectedly
obliging
as
to
die
after
all
if
he
had
known
how
to
pray
he
would
have
done
it
beseeched
whatever
gods
there
were
to
let
the
thing
come
to
an
end
at
last
offered
any
bribe
within
his
power
if
they
would
set
him
free
from
his
bondage
by
disposing
of
his
cousin
but
there
beside
him
clinging
to
his
arm
was
tony
holiday
aquiver
with
grief
for
this
same
cousin
he
saw
that
there
were
tears
on
her
cheeks
tears
that
the
icy
wind
turned
instantly
to
frosted
silver
and
suddenly
a
new
power
was
invoked
the
power
of
love
tony
darling
do
cry
he
beseeched
i
ca
stand
it
he
he
wo
die
and
then
and
there
a
miracle
took
place
alan
massey
who
had
never
prayed
in
his
life
was
praying
to
some
god
somewhere
to
save
john
massey
for
tony
because
she
loved
him
and
his
dying
would
hurt
her
tony
must
not
be
hurt
any
god
could
see
that
it
must
not
be
permitted
tony
put
up
her
hand
and
brushed
away
the
frosted
silver
drops
no
he
is
going
to
die
i
not
going
to
let

to
mexico

love
you

but
there
are
some
things
that
go
even
deeper
things
that
have
their
very
roots
in
me
the
things
that
belong
to
the
hill
and
dick
is
a
very
big
part
of
them
sometimes
i
think
he
is
the
biggest
part
of
all
i
have
to
go
to
him
please
do
try
to
stop
me
it
will
only
make
us
both
unhappy
if
you
try
a
bitter
blast
struck
their
faces
with
the
force
of
a
blow
tony
shivered
let
go
back
i
cold
so
dreadfully
cold
she
moaned
clinging
to
his
arm
they
turned
in
silence
there
was
nothing
to
say
the
sunset
glory
had
faded
now
only
a
pale
cold
mauve
tint
was
left
where
the
flame
had
blazed
a
star
or
two
had
come
out
the
river
flowed
sinister
black
showing
white
humps
of
foam

and
there
at

play

chapter
xxxii
dwellers
in
dreams
the
last
curtain
had
gone
down
on
the
end
of
the
rainbow
and
tony
holiday
had
made
an
undeniable
hit
caught
the
popular
fancy
by
her
young
charm
and
vivid
personality
and
fresh
talents
to
such
a
degree
that
for
the
moment
at
least
even
its
idol
of
many
seasons
carol
clay
was
forgotten
the
new
arriving
star
filled
the
whole
firmament
broadway
was
ready
to
worship
at
a
new
shrine
but
broadway
did
not
know
that
there
were
two
tony
holidays
that
night
the
happy
tony
who
had
taken
its
fickle
composite
heart
by
storm
and
the
other
tony
half
distracted
by
grief
and
trapped
bewilderment
tony
had
willed
to
exile
that
second
self
before
she
stepped
out
behind
the
foot
lights
she
knew
if
she
did
not
she
never
could
play
madge
as
madge
had
the
right
to
be
played
for
her
own
sake
for
max
hempel
sake
because
he
believed
in
her
for
carol
clay
sake
because
tony
loved
her
she
meant
to
forget
everything
but
madge
for
those
few
hours
later
she
would
remember
that
dick
was
dying
in
mexico
that
she
had
hurt
alan
cruelly
that
afternoon
that
she
had
a
sad
and
vexed
problem
to
solve
to
which
there
seemed
no
solution
these
things
must
wait
and
they
had
waited
but
they
came
crowding
back
upon
her
the
moment
the
play
was
over
and
she
saw
alan
waiting
for
her
in
the
little
room
off
the
wings
he
rose
to
meet
her
and
oblivious
of
curious
eyes
about
them
drew
her
into
his
arms
and
kissed
her
and
tony
utterly
miserable
in
a
daze
of
conflicting
emotions
nestled
in
his
embrace
unresisting
for
a
second
not
caring
any
more
than
alan
himself
what
any
one
saw
or
thought
upon
seeing
you
were
wonderful
belovedest
he
whispered
i
never
saw
them
go
madder
over
anybody
not
even
carol
herself
tony
glowed
all
over
at
his
praise
and
begged
that
they
might
drive
a
little
in
the
park
before
they
went
home
she
had
to
think
she
think
in
the
hostelry
it
stifled
her
nothing
loath
alan
acquiesced
hailed
a
cab
and
gave
the
necessary
orders
for
a
moment
they
rode
in
silence
tony
relaxing
for
the
first
time
in
many
hours
in
the
comfort
of
her
lover
presence
his
arm
around
her
things
were
hard
terribly
hard
but
you
could
not
feel
utterly
disconsolate
when
the
man
you
loved
best
in
all
the
world
was
there
right
beside
you
looking
at
you
with
eyes
that
told
you
how
much
you
were
beloved
in
return
tony
dear
i
am
going
to
surprise
you
he
said
suddenly
breaking
the
silence
i
have
decided
to
go
to
mexico
to
go
to
mexico
alan
why
tony
drew
away
from
her
companion
to
study
his
face
with
amazement
on
her
own
to
find
carson
and
look
after
him
why
else
but
your
exhibition
you
ca
go
away
now
alan
even
if
i
would
let
you
go
to
dick
that
way
oh
yes
i
can
the
arrangements
are
all
made
van
slyke
can
handle
the
last
stages
of
the
thing
far
better
than
i
can
i
loathe
hanging
round
and
hearing
the
fools
rant
about
my
stuff
and
wonder
what
the
devil
i
meant
by
this
or
that
or
if
i
did
mean
anything
i
am
infinitely
better
off
three
thousand
miles
away
but
even
so
i
do
want
to
hurt
you
or
act
as
if
i
did
appreciate
what
you
are
offering
to
do
but
you
hate
dick
i
do
see
how
you
could
help
him
i
do
hate
him
any
more
tony
at
least
i
do
think
i
do
at
any
rate
whether
i
do
or
do
wo
make
the
slightest
bit
of
difference
i
shall
look
after
him
as
well
as
your
uncle
or
your
brothers
would
better
perhaps
because
i
know
mexico
well
and
how
to
get
things
done
down
there
i
know
how
to
get
things
done
in
most
places
oh
i
know
i
have
often
thought
you
must
have
magic
at
your
command
the
way
people
fly
to
do
your
bidding
it
is
startling
but
it
is
awfully
convenient
money
magic
mostly
he
retorted
grimly
partly
not
mostly
you
are
a
born
potentate
you
must
have
been
a
sultan
or
a
pashaw
or
something
in
some
previous
incarnation
i
care
what
you
are
if
you
will
find
dick
and
see
that
he
gets
well
alan
do
you
think
could
i
would
it
be
better
if
i
went
too
there
was
a
sudden
gleam
in
alan
eyes
the
hour
was
his
he
could
take
advantage
of
the
situation
of
the
girl
anxiety
for
his
cousin
her
love
for
himself
while
it
was
at
high
tide
as
it
was
at
this
over
stimulated
hour
of
excitement
he
could
marry
her
and
once
the
rite
was
spoken
not
john
massey
not
all
holiday
hill
combined
could
take
her
from
him
she
would
be
his
and
his
alone
to
the
end
tony
was
ripe
for
madness
overwrought
ready
to
take
any
wild
leap
in
the
dark
with
him
he
could
make
her
his
he
felt
the
intoxicating
truth
quiver
in
the
touch
of
her
hand
read
it
in
her
eager
dark
eyes
lifted
to
his
for
his
answer
alan
massey
was
unused
to
putting
away
temptation
but
this
perhaps
the
biggest
and
blackest
that
had
ever
assailed
him
he
put
by
no
dear
i
go
alone
he
said
you
will
just
have
to
trust
me
tony
i
swear
i
do
everything
in
the
world
that
can
be
done
for
carson
let
us
have
just
one
dance
though
i
should
like
it
to
remember
in
mexico
tony
hesitated
it
was
very
late
the
hostelry
would
ill
approve
of
her
going
anywhere
to
dance
at
such
an
hour
it
ill
approved
of
alan
massey
any
way
still
i
am
going
it
is
our
last
chance
he
pleaded
just
one
dance
it
may
have
to
last
a
long
long
time
and
tony
yielded
after
all
they
could
not
treat
this
night
as
if
it
were
like
all
the
other
nights
in
the
calendar
they
had
the
right
to
their
one
more
hour
of
happiness
before
alan
went
away
they
had
the
right
to
this
one
last
dance
the
one
dance
turned
into
many
before
they
were
through
it
seemed
to
both
as
if
they
dared
not
stop
lest
somehow
love
and
happiness
should
stop
too
with
the
end
of
the
music
they
danced
on
and
on
divinely
as
alan
had
once
called
it
tony
thought
the
rest
of
his
prophecy
was
fulfilled
at
last
that
they
also
loved
each
other
divinely
as
no
man
or
woman
had
ever
loved
since
time
began
but
at
last
this
too
had
to
come
to
an
end
as
perfect
moments
must
in
this
finite
world
and
alan
and
tony
went
out
of
the
brilliantly
lighted
restaurant
into
white
whirls
of
snow
for
a
storm
had
started
while
they
had
been
inside
and
was
now
well
in
progress
all
too
soon
the
cab
deposited
them
at
the
hostelry
in
the
dimly
lit
hall
alan
drew
the
girl
into
his
arms
and
kissed
her
passionately
then
suddenly
almost
flung
her
from
him
muttered
a
curt
and
before
tony
hardly
realized
he
was
going
was
gone
swallowed
up
in
the
night
and
storm
alone
tony
put
her
hands
over
her
hot
cheeks
so
this
was
love
it
was
terrible
but
oh
it
was
wonderful
too
soberly
after
a
moment
she
went
to
change
the
damning
out
opposite
her
name
in
the
hall
bulletin
just
as
the
clock
struck
the
shocking
hour
of
three
but
lo
there
was
no
damning
out
visible
only
a
meek
and
proper
in
after
her
name
for
all
the
bulletin
proclaimed
antoinette
holiday
might
have
been
for
hours
wrapt
in
innocent
slumber
instead
of
speeding
away
the
wee
sma
hours
in
a
public
restaurant
in
the
arms
of
a
lover
at
whom
madame
grundy
and
her
allies
looked
awry
somebody
had
tampered
with
the
thing
to
save
tony
a
reprimand
or
worse
but
who
jean
no
certainly
not
jean
jean
conscience
was
as
inelastic
as
a
yard
stick
whoever
had
committed
the
charitable
act
of
mendacity
it
could
have
been
jean
but
when
tony
opened
her
own
door
and
switched
on
the
light
there
was
jean
curled
up
asleep
in
the
big
arm
chair
the
sudden
flare
of
light
roused
the
sleeper
and
she
sat
up
blinking
wherever
have
you
been
tony
i
have
been
worried
to
death
about
you
i
been
home
from
the
theater
for
hours
i
could
think
what
had
happened
to
you
i
am
sorry
you
worried
you
need
have
i
was
with
alan
of
course
tony
people
say
dreadful
things
about
massey
are
you
ever
afraid
of
him
yourself
jean
surveyed
the
younger
girl
with
troubled
eyes
tony
flung
off
her
cloak
impatiently
of
course
i
am
not
afraid
people
do
know
him
when
they
say
such
things
about
him
you
need
ever
worry
jean
i
am
safer
with
alan
than
with
any
one
else
in
the
world
i
know
that
if
i
never
knew
it
before
we
were
dancing
i
knew
it
was
late
but
i
did
care
i
would
have
missed
those
dances
if
they
had
told
me
i
had
to
pack
my
trunk
and
leave
thus
spoke
the
rebel
always
ready
to
fly
out
like
a
box
from
under
the
lid
in
tony
holiday
they
wo
said
jean
in
a
queer
compressed
little
voice
jean
was
it
you
that
fixed
that
bulletin
yes
it
was
i
know
it
was
a
nice
thing
to
do
but
i
did
want
them
to
scold
you
just
now
when
you
were
so
worried
about
dick
and
everything
i
thought
you
would
be
in
most
any
minute
any
way
and
i
waited
up
myself
to
tell
you
how
i
loved
the
play
and
how
proud
i
was
of
you
then
when
you
did
come
for
so
long
i
got
really
scared
and
then
i
fell
asleep
and
tony
came
over
and
stopped
the
older
girl
words
with
a
kiss
you
are
a
sweet
peach
jean
lambert
and
i
am
awfully
grateful
to
you
for
straining
your
conscience
like
that
for
my
sake
and
awfully
sorry
i
worried
you
i
am
afraid
i
always
do
worry
good
sensible
proper
people
i
made
that
way
mad
north
north
west
like
hamlet
she
added
whimsically
maybe
we
holidays
are
all
mad
that
much
excepting
uncle
phil
of
course
he
all
that
keeps
the
rest
of
us
on
the
track
of
sanity
at
all
but
alan
is
madder
still
jean
he
is
going
to
mexico
to
take
care
of
dick
massey
is
going
to
mexico
to
take
care
of
dick
jean
stared
why
tony
i
thought
naturally
so
did
i
who
would
think
him
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
do
a
thing
like
that
but
he
is
going
and
it
is
his
idea
not
mine
i
wanted
to
go
too
but
he
would
let
me
she
added
jean
gasped
tony
you
would
have
married
him
when
your
uncle
when
everybody
does
want
you
to
to
jean
lambert
well
ordered
carefully
fenced
in
mind
such
wild
mental
leaps
as
tony
holiday
were
almost
too
much
to
contemplate
but
worse
was
to
come
married
him
oh
i
do
know
i
did
think
about
that
i
would
just
have
gone
with
him
there
would
have
been
time
to
get
a
license
of
course
i
could
though
on
account
of
the
play
jean
gasped
again
if
it
had
been
for
the
play
this
astounding
young
person
before
her
would
have
gone
gallivanting
off
with
one
man
to
whom
she
was
not
married
to
the
bedside
thousands
of
miles
away
of
another
man
to
whom
she
was
also
not
married
such
simplicity
of
mental
processes
surpassed
any
complexity
jean
lambert
could
possibly
conceive
alan
would
let
me
repeated
the
astounding
tony
i
suppose
it
is
better
so
by
i
will
probably
agree
with
him
when
the
wind
is
southerly
i
know
a
hawk
from
a
handsaw
too
but
the
wind
is
southerly
it
was
when
i
was
dancing
nor
afterward
she
added
with
a
flaming
color
in
her
cheeks
remembering
that
moment
in
the
hostelry
hall
when
wisdom
had
mattered
very
little
to
her
in
comparison
with
love
oh
jean
what
if
something
dreadful
should
happen
to
him
down
there
i
let
him
go
i
ca
but
dick
must
die
alone
either
oh
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
and
suddenly
tony
threw
herself
face
down
on
the
bed
sobbing
great
heart
rending
sobs
but
whether
she
was
crying
for
dick
or
alan
or
herself
or
all
three
jean
was
unable
to
decipher
perhaps
tony
did
not
know
herself
the
next
morning
when
tony
awoke
alan
had
already
left
for
his
long
journey
but
a
great
box
full
of
roses
told
her
she
had
been
his
last
thought
one
by
one
she
lifted
them
out
of
the
box
great
gorgeous
blood
red
beauties
royal
tony
thought
like
the
royal
lover
who
had
sent
them
the
only
message
with
the
flowers
was
a
bit
of
verse
a
poem
of
tagore
whom
alan
loved
and
had
taught
tony
to
love
too
you
are
the
evening
cloud
floating
in
the
sky
of
my
dreams
i
paint
you
and
fashion
you
with
my
love
longings
you
are
my
own
my
own
dweller
in
my
endless
dreams
your
feet
are
with
the
glow
of
my
desire
gleaner
of
my
sunset
songs
your
lips
are
with
the
taste
of
my
wine
of
pain
you
are
my
own
my
own
dweller
in
my
lonesome
dreams
with
the
shadow
of
my
passion
have
i
darkened
your
eyes
haunter
of
the
depth
of
my
gaze
i
have
caught
you
and
wrapt
you
my
love
in
the
net
of
my
music
you
are
my
own
my
own
dweller
in
my
deathless
dreams
as
she
read
the
exquisite
lines
antoinette
holiday
knew
it
was
all
true
the
poet
might
have
written
his
poem
for
her
and
alan
her
lips
were
indeed
with
the
taste
of
his
wine
of
pain
her
eyes
were
darkened
by
his
shadows
he
had
caught
her
and
wrapt
her
in
the
net
of
his
love
which
was
a
kind
of
music
in
itself
a
music
one
danced
to
she
was
his
dweller
in
his
dreams
as
he
was
always
to
dwell
in
hers
it
was
fate
chapter
xxxiii
waiting
for
the
end
of
the
story
at
home
on
the
hill
ruth
affairs
developed
slowly
it
was
in
time
ascertained
from
australia
that
the
farringdon
pearls
had
come
to
america
in
the
possession
of
miss
farringdon
who
was
named
elinor
ruth
daughter
of
roderick
and
esther
farringdon
both
deceased
what
had
become
of
her
and
her
pearls
no
one
knew
grave
fears
had
been
entertained
as
to
the
girl
safety
because
of
her
prolonged
silence
and
the
utter
failure
of
all
the
advertising
for
her
which
had
gone
on
in
english
and
american
papers
she
had
come
to
america
to
join
an
aunt
one
robert
wright
widow
of
a
new
york
broker
but
it
had
been
later
ascertained
that
wright
had
left
for
england
before
her
niece
could
have
reached
her
and
had
subsequently
died
having
caught
a
fever
while
engaged
in
nursing
in
a
military
hospital
roderick
farringdon
the
brother
of
elinor
ruth
an
aviator
in
his
majesty
service
was
reported
missing
believed
to
be
dead
or
in
a
german
prison
somewhere
the
lawyers
in
charge
of
the
huge
business
interests
of
the
two
young
farringdons
were
in
grave
distress
because
of
their
inability
to
locate
either
of
the
owners
and
begged
that
if
doctor
laurence
holiday
knew
anything
of
the
whereabouts
of
miss
farringdon
that
he
would
communicate
without
delay
with
them
so
far
so
good
granted
that
ruth
was
presumably
elinor
ruth
farringdon
of
australia
was
she
or
was
she
not
married
there
had
been
no
opportunity
in
the
cables
to
make
inquiry
about
one
geoffrey
annersley
though
larry
had
put
that
important
question
first
in
his
letter
to
the
consul
which
as
yet
had
received
no
answer
the
lawyers
stated
that
when
miss
farringdon
had
left
australia
she
was
not
married
but
unsubstantiated
rumors
had
reached
them
from
san
francisco
hinting
at
her
possible
marriage
there
all
this
failed
to
stir
ruth
dormant
memory
in
any
degree
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
until
further
information
should
be
forthcoming
not
unnaturally
these
facts
had
a
somewhat
different
effect
upon
the
two
individuals
most
concerned
ruth
was
frankly
elated
over
the
whole
thing
and
found
it
by
no
means
impossible
to
believe
that
she
was
a
princess
in
disguise
though
she
had
played
cinderella
contentedly
enough
on
the
strength
of
her
presumable
princessship
she
had
gone
on
another
excursion
to
boston
carrying
the
lambert
twins
with
her
this
time
and
had
returned
laden
with
all
manner
of
feminine
fripperies
she
had
an
exquisite
taste
and
made
unerringly
for
the
softest
and
finest
of
fabrics
the
hats
with
an
air
the
dresses
that
were
the
simplest
the
most
ravishing
and
it
must
be
admitted
also
the
most
extravagant
if
she
remembered
nothing
else
ruth
remembered
how
to
spend
royally
she
had
consulted
the
senior
doctor
before
making
the
splendid
plunge
she
did
not
want
to
have
larry
buy
her
anything
more
and
she
did
want
doctor
philip
and
margery
to
think
her
stark
mad
to
go
behaving
like
a
princess
before
the
princess
purse
was
actually
in
her
hands
but
she
had
to
have
pretty
things
a
lot
of
them
had
to
have
them
quick
did
the
doctor
mind
very
much
advancing
her
some
money
he
could
keep
her
rings
as
security
he
had
laughed
indulgently
and
declared
as
the
rings
and
the
pearls
too
for
that
matter
were
in
his
possession
in
the
safe
deposit
box
he
should
worry
he
also
told
her
to
go
ahead
and
be
as
princessy
as
she
liked
he
would
take
the
risk
whereupon
he
placed
a
generous
sum
of
money
at
her
account
in
a
boston
bank
and
sent
her
away
with
his
blessing
and
an
amused
smile
at
the
femininity
of
females
and
ruth
had
gone
and
played
princess
to
her
heart
content
but
there
was
little
enough
of
content
in
any
of
it
for
poor
larry
day
by
day
it
seemed
to
him
he
could
see
his
fairy
girl
slipping
away
from
him
ruth
was
a
great
lady
and
heiress
who
was
larry
holiday
to
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
circumstances
had
almost
thrown
her
into
his
willing
arms
moreover
the
information
afforded
as
to
roderick
farringdon
had
put
a
new
idea
into
his
head
roderick
was
reported
missing
was
it
not
possible
that
geoffrey
annersley
might
be
in
the
same
category
missing
men
sometimes
stayed
missing
in
war
time
but
sometimes
also
they
returned
as
from
the
dead
from
enemy
prisons
or
long
illnesses
what
if
this
should
be
the
case
with
the
man
who
was
presumably
ruth
husband
certainly
it
put
out
of
the
question
if
there
ever
had
been
a
question
in
mind
his
own
right
to
marry
the
girl
he
loved
until
they
knew
absolutely
that
the
way
was
clear
considering
these
things
it
was
not
strange
that
the
new
year
found
larry
holiday
in
heavy
mood
morose
silent
curt
and
unresponsive
even
to
his
uncle
inclined
at
times
to
snap
even
at
his
beloved
little
goldilocks
whose
shining
new
happiness
exasperated
him
because
he
could
not
share
it
of
course
he
repented
in
sack
cloth
and
ashes
afterward
but
repentance
did
not
prevent
other
offenses
and
altogether
the
young
doctor
was
ill
to
live
with
during
those
harrassed
january
days
it
was
not
only
ruth
larry
could
not
take
ted
going
with
the
quiet
fortitude
with
which
his
uncle
met
it
those
early
weeks
of
nineteen
hundred
and
seventeen
were
black
ones
for
many
the
grim
moloch
war
demanded
more
and
ever
more
victims
thousands
of
gay
brave
high
spirited
lads
like
ted
were
mown
down
daily
by
shrapnel
and
machine
gun
or
sent
twisted
and
writhing
to
still
more
hideous
death
in
the
unspeakable
horror
of
noxious
gases
it
was
all
so
unnecessary
so
senseless
larry
holiday
whose
life
was
dedicated
to
the
healing
and
saving
of
men
bodies
hated
with
bitter
hate
this
opposing
force
which
was
all
for
destruction
and
which
held
the
groaning
world
in
its
relentless
grip
it
would
not
have
been
so
bad
he
thought
if
the
moloch
would
have
been
content
to
take
merely
the
old
the
life
weary
the
diseased
the
vile
not
so
it
demanded
the
young
the
strong
the
clean
and
gallant
hearted
took
their
bodies
maimed
and
tortured
them
killed
them
sooner
or
later
hurled
them
undiscriminatingly
into
the
bottomless
pit
of
death
to
larry
it
all
came
back
to
ted
ted
was
the
embodiment
the
symbol
of
the
rest
he
was
the
young
the
strong
the
clean
and
gallant
hearted
the
youth
of
the
world
a
vain
sacrifice
to
the
cruel
blindness
of
a
so
called
civilization
which
would
not
learn
the
futility
of
war
and
all
the
ways
of
war
so
while
ruth
bought
pretty
clothes
and
basked
in
happy
anticipations
which
for
her
took
the
place
of
memories
poor
larry
walked
in
dark
places
and
saw
no
single
ray
of
light
one
afternoon
he
was
summoned
to
the
telephone
to
receive
the
word
that
there
was
a
telegram
for
him
at
the
office
it
was
dunbury
informal
habit
to
telephone
messages
of
this
sort
to
the
recipient
instead
of
delivering
them
in
person
larry
took
the
repeated
word
in
silence
a
question
evidently
followed
from
the
other
end
yes
i
got
it
larry
snapped
back
and
threw
the
receiver
back
in
place
with
vicious
energy
his
uncle
who
had
happened
to
be
near
looked
up
to
ask
a
question
but
the
young
doctor
was
already
out
of
the
room
leaving
only
the
slam
of
the
door
in
his
wake
a
few
moments
later
the
older
man
saw
the
younger
start
off
down
the
hill
in
the
car
at
a
speed
which
was
not
unlike
ted
at
his
worst
before
the
smash
on
the
florence
road
evidently
larry
was
on
the
war
path
why
the
afternoon
wore
on
larry
did
not
return
his
uncle
began
to
be
seriously
disturbed
a
patient
with
whom
the
junior
doctor
had
had
an
appointment
came
and
waited
and
finally
went
away
somewhat
indignant
in
spite
of
all
efforts
to
soothe
her
not
unnatural
wrath
worse
and
worse
larry
never
failed
his
appointments
met
every
obligation
invariably
as
punctiliously
as
if
for
professional
purposes
he
was
operated
by
clock
work
at
supper
time
phil
lambert
dropped
in
with
the
wire
which
had
already
been
reported
to
larry
and
which
the
company
with
the
same
informality
already
mentioned
had
asked
him
to
deliver
doctor
holiday
was
tempted
to
read
it
but
refrained
surely
the
boy
would
be
home
soon
the
evening
meal
was
rather
a
silent
one
ruth
was
wearing
a
charming
dark
blue
velvet
gown
which
larry
especially
liked
the
doctor
guessed
that
she
had
dressed
particularly
for
her
lover
and
was
sadly
disappointed
when
he
failed
to
put
in
his
appearance
she
drooped
perceptibly
and
her
blue
eyes
were
wistful
an
hour
later
when
the
three
margery
her
husband
and
ruth
were
sitting
quietly
engaged
in
reading
in
the
living
room
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
returning
car
all
three
were
distinctly
conscious
of
an
involuntary
breath
of
relief
which
permeated
the
room
nobody
had
said
a
word
but
every
one
of
them
had
been
filled
with
foreboding
presently
larry
entered
with
the
yellow
envelope
in
his
hand
he
was
pale
and
very
tired
looking
but
obviously
entirely
in
command
of
himself
whatever
had
been
the
case
earlier
in
the
day
he
crossed
the
room
to
where
his
uncle
sat
and
handed
him
the
telegram
please
read
it
aloud
he
said
it
it
concerns
all
of
us
the
older
doctor
complied
with
the
request
dunbury
january
nine
so
ran
the
brief
though
pregnant
message
it
was
signed
geoffrey
the
color
went
out
of
ruth
face
as
she
heard
the
name
she
put
her
hands
over
her
eyes
and
uttered
a
little
moan
then
abruptly
she
dropped
her
hands
the
color
came
surging
back
into
her
cheeks
and
she
ran
to
larry
fairly
throwing
herself
into
his
arms
i
do
want
to
see
him
do
let
him
come
i
hate
him
i
do
want
to
be
elinor
farringdon
i
want
to
be
just
ruth
ruth
holiday
she
whispered
the
last
in
larry
ear
her
head
on
his
shoulder
larry
kissed
her
for
the
first
time
before
the
others
then
meeting
his
uncle
grave
eyes
he
put
her
gently
from
him
and
walked
over
to
the
door
on
the
threshold
he
turned
and
faced
them
all
uncle
phil
aunt
margery
help
ruth
i
ca
and
the
door
closed
upon
him
philip
and
margery
did
their
best
to
obey
his
parting
injunction
but
it
was
not
an
easy
task
ruth
was
possessed
by
a
very
panic
of
dread
of
geoffrey
annersley
and
an
even
more
difficult
to
deal
with
flood
of
love
for
larry
holiday
i
do
want
anybody
but
larry
she
wailed
over
and
over
it
is
larry
i
love
i
do
love
geoffrey
annersley
i
wo
let
him
be
my
husband
i
do
want
anybody
but
larry
in
vain
they
tried
to
comfort
her
entreat
her
to
wait
until
before
she
gave
up
perhaps
geoffrey
annersley
was
her
husband
perhaps
everything
was
quite
all
right
she
must
try
to
have
patience
and
not
let
herself
get
sick
worrying
in
advance
he
my
husband
she
suddenly
announced
with
startling
conviction
i
remember
his
putting
the
ring
on
my
finger
i
remember
his
saying
got
to
wear
it
it
is
the
only
thing
to
do
you
must
i
remember
what
he
looks
like
almost
he
is
tall
and
he
has
a
scar
on
his
cheek
here
she
patted
her
own
face
feverishly
to
show
the
spot
he
made
me
wear
the
ring
and
i
did
want
to
i
did
want
to
oh
do
let
me
remember
do
let
me
she
implored
at
this
point
the
doctor
took
things
in
his
own
hands
the
child
was
obviously
beginning
to
remember
the
shock
of
the
man
coming
had
snapped
something
in
her
brain
they
must
not
let
things
come
back
too
disastrously
fast
he
packed
her
off
to
bed
with
a
stiff
dose
of
nerve
quieting
medicine
margery
sat
with
her
arms
tight
around
the
forlorn
little
sufferer
and
presently
the
dreary
sobbing
ceased
and
the
girl
drifted
off
to
exhausted
sleep
nature
kindest
panacea
for
all
human
ills
meanwhile
the
doctor
sought
out
larry
he
found
him
in
the
office
apparently
completely
absorbed
in
the
perusal
of
a
medical
magazine
he
looked
up
quickly
as
the
older
man
entered
and
answered
the
question
in
his
eyes
giving
assurance
that
ruth
was
quite
all
right
would
soon
be
asleep
if
she
was
not
already
he
made
no
mention
of
that
disconcerting
flash
of
memory
sufficient
unto
the
day
was
the
trouble
thereof
he
came
over
and
laid
a
kindly
encouraging
hand
on
the
boy
shoulder
keep
up
heart
a
little
longer
he
said
by
tomorrow
you
will
know
where
you
stand
and
that
will
be
something
no
matter
which
way
it
turns
i
should
say
it
would
groaned
larry
i
sick
of
being
in
a
labyrinth
even
the
worst
ca
be
much
worse
than
not
knowing
you
know
how
tough
it
has
been
uncle
phil
i
can
make
a
fairly
good
guess
at
it
my
boy
i
seen
and
understood
more
than
you
realize
perhaps
you
have
put
up
a
magnificent
fight
son
and
you
are
the
boy
who
once
told
me
he
was
a
coward
i
am
afraid
i
still
am
uncle
phil
sometimes
we
all
are
larry
cowards
in
our
hearts
but
that
does
not
matter
so
long
as
the
yellow
streak
does
get
into
our
acts
you
have
not
let
that
happen
i
think
larry
was
silent
he
was
remembering
that
night
when
ruth
had
come
to
him
he
was
very
proud
of
the
memory
he
wondered
if
his
uncle
guessed
how
near
the
yellow
streak
had
come
to
the
surface
on
that
occasion
i
do
deserve
as
much
credit
as
you
are
giving
me
he
said
humbly
there
have
been
times
at
least
one
time
he
broke
off
you
would
have
been
less
than
a
man
if
there
had
not
been
larry
i
understand
all
that
but
on
the
whole
you
know
and
i
know
that
you
have
a
clean
slate
to
show
do
let
yourself
get
morbid
worrying
about
things
you
might
have
done
and
did
they
do
worry
me
they
need
worry
you
forget
it
uncle
phil
you
are
great
the
way
you
always
clear
away
the
fogs
but
my
clean
slate
is
a
great
deal
thanks
to
you
i
do
know
where
i
would
have
landed
if
you
had
held
me
back
not
so
much
by
what
you
said
as
what
you
are
ted
is
the
only
one
who
has
learned
to
appreciate
what
a
pillar
of
strength
we
all
have
in
you
however
this
comes
out
i
forget
what
you
did
for
me
are
doing
all
the
time
thank
you
larry
it
is
good
to
hear
things
like
that
though
i
think
you
underestimate
your
own
strength
i
am
thankful
if
i
have
helped
in
any
degree
i
have
felt
futile
enough
we
all
have
at
any
rate
the
strain
is
about
over
the
telegram
must
have
been
a
knock
down
blow
though
where
were
you
this
afternoon
i
do
know
i
just
drove
like
the
devil
anywhere
did
you
worry
i
am
sorry
good
lord
i
cut
my
appointment
with
blake
did
i
i
never
thought
of
it
until
this
minute
gee
i
am
worse
than
ted
used
to
think
i
had
some
balance
but
evidently
i
am
a
plain
nut
i
disgusted
with
myself
and
i
should
think
you
would
be
more
disgusted
with
me
the
boy
looked
up
at
his
uncle
with
eyes
that
were
full
of
shamed
compunction
but
the
latter
smiled
back
consolingly
do
worry
there
are
worse
things
in
the
world
than
cutting
an
appointment
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
you
will
get
back
your
balance
when
things
get
normal
again
i
have
no
complaint
to
make
anyway
you
have
kept
up
the
professional
end
splendidly
until
now
what
you
need
is
a
good
long
vacation
and
i
am
going
to
pack
you
off
on
one
at
the
earliest
opportunity
do
you
want
me
to
meet
captain
annersley
for
you
tomorrow
he
switched
off
to
ask
larry
shook
his
head
no
i
meet
him
myself
thank
you
it
is
my
job
i
am
not
going
to
flunk
it
if
he
is
ruth
husband
i
am
going
to
be
the
first
to
shake
hands
with
him
chapter
xxxiv
in
which
two
masseys
meet
in
mexico
and
while
things
were
moving
toward
their
crisis
for
larry
and
ruth
another
drama
was
progressing
more
or
less
swiftly
to
its
conclusion
down
in
vera
cruz
alan
massey
had
found
his
cousin
in
a
wretched
vermin
haunted
shack
nursed
in
haphazard
fashion
by
a
slovenly
ignorant
woman
under
the
ostensible
professional
care
of
a
mercenary
incompetent
drunken
mexican
doctor
who
cared
little
enough
whether
the
dog
of
an
american
lived
or
died
so
long
as
he
himself
continued
to
get
the
generous
checks
from
a
certain
newspaper
in
new
york
city
the
doctor
held
the
credulity
of
the
men
who
mailed
those
checks
in
fine
contempt
and
proceeded
to
feather
his
nest
valiantly
while
his
good
luck
continued
going
on
many
a
glorious
spree
at
the
paper
expense
while
dick
carson
went
down
every
day
deeper
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
with
the
coming
of
alan
massey
however
a
new
era
began
alan
was
apt
to
leave
transformation
of
one
sort
or
another
in
his
wake
it
was
not
merely
his
money
magic
though
he
wielded
that
magnificently
as
was
his
habit
and
predilection
spent
mexican
dollars
with
a
superb
disregard
of
their
value
which
won
from
the
natives
a
respect
akin
to
awe
and
wrought
miracles
wherever
the
golden
flow
touched
but
there
was
more
than
money
magic
to
alan
massey
performance
in
vera
cruz
there
was
also
the
magic
of
his
dominating
magnetic
personality
he
was
a
born
master
and
every
one
high
or
low
who
crossed
his
path
recognized
his
rightful
ascendency
and
hastened
to
obey
his
royal
will
his
first
step
was
to
get
the
sick
man
transferred
from
the
filthy
hovel
in
which
he
found
him
to
clean
comfortable
quarters
in
an
ancient
adobe
palace
screened
airy
spacious
the
second
step
was
to
secure
the
services
of
two
competent
and
high
priced
nurses
from
mexico
city
one
an
american
the
other
an
english
woman
both
experienced
intrepid
efficient
the
third
step
taken
simultaneously
with
the
other
two
was
to
dismiss
the
man
who
masqueraded
as
a
physician
though
he
was
nothing
in
reality
but
a
cheap
charlatan
fattening
himself
at
the
expense
of
weakness
and
disease
the
man
had
been
inclined
to
make
trouble
at
first
about
his
unceremonious
discharge
he
had
no
mind
to
lose
without
a
protest
such
a
convenient
source
of
unearned
increment
as
those
checks
represented
he
had
intended
to
get
in
many
another
good
carouse
before
the
sick
man
died
or
got
well
as
nature
willed
but
a
single
interview
with
alan
massey
sufficed
to
lay
his
objections
to
leaving
the
case
in
concise
and
forcible
language
couched
in
perfect
spanish
alan
had
made
it
clear
that
if
the
doctor
came
near
his
victim
again
he
would
be
shot
down
like
a
dog
and
if
carson
died
he
would
in
any
case
be
tried
for
man
slaughter
and
hanged
on
the
spot
the
last
point
had
been
further
punctuated
by
an
expressive
gesture
on
the
speaker
part
pointing
to
his
own
throat
accompanied
by
a
significant
little
gurgling
sound
the
gesture
and
the
gurgle
had
been
convincing
the
man
surrendered
the
case
in
some
haste
he
did
not
at
all
care
for
the
style
of
conversation
indulged
in
by
this
tall
unsmiling
man
consequently
he
immediately
evaporated
to
all
intents
and
purposes
and
was
seen
no
more
the
new
physician
put
in
charge
was
a
different
breed
entirely
a
man
who
had
the
authentic
gift
and
passion
for
healing
which
the
born
doctor
always
possesses
be
he
christian
or
heathen
gypsy
herb
mixer
or
ten
thousand
dollar
specialist
alan
explained
to
this
man
precisely
what
was
required
of
him
explained
in
the
same
forcible
concise
perfect
spanish
that
had
banished
the
other
so
completely
his
job
was
to
cure
the
sick
man
if
he
succeeded
there
would
be
a
generous
remuneration
if
he
failed
through
no
fault
of
his
there
would
still
be
fair
remuneration
though
nothing
like
what
would
be
his
in
case
of
complete
recovery
if
he
failed
through
negligence
and
here
the
expressive
gesture
and
the
gurgle
were
repeated
the
sentence
had
not
needed
completion
the
matter
was
sufficiently
elucidated
the
man
was
a
born
healer
as
has
been
recorded
but
even
if
he
had
not
been
he
would
still
have
felt
obliged
to
move
heaven
and
earth
so
far
as
in
him
lay
to
cure
dick
carson
alan
manner
was
persuasive
one
did
one
best
to
satisfy
a
person
who
spoke
such
spanish
and
made
such
ominous
gestures
one
did
as
one
was
commanded
one
dared
do
no
other
as
for
the
servants
whom
alan
rallied
to
his
standard
they
were
slaves
rather
than
servants
they
recognized
in
him
their
preordained
master
were
wax
to
his
hands
mats
to
his
feet
they
obeyed
his
word
as
obsequiously
faithfully
and
unquestioningly
as
if
he
could
by
a
clap
of
his
lordly
hands
banish
them
to
strange
deaths
they
talked
in
low
tones
about
him
among
themselves
behind
his
back
this
was
no
american
they
said
no
american
could
command
as
this
one
commanded
no
american
had
such
gift
of
tongues
such
gestures
such
picturesque
and
varied
and
awesome
oaths
no
american
carried
small
bright
flashing
daggers
such
as
he
carried
in
his
inner
pockets
nor
did
americans
talk
glibly
as
he
talked
of
weird
poisons
not
every
day
drugs
but
marvelous
death
dealing
concoctions
done
up
in
lustrous
capsules
or
diluted
in
sparkling
insidious
gorgeous
hued
fluids
the
man
was
too
wise
altogether
too
wise
to
be
an
american
he
had
traveled
much
knew
strange
secrets
they
rather
thought
he
knew
black
art
certainly
he
knew
more
of
the
arts
of
healing
than
the
doctor
himself
there
was
nothing
he
did
not
know
the
one
it
was
best
to
obey
him
and
while
alan
massey
various
arts
operated
dick
carson
passed
through
a
series
of
mental
and
physical
evolutions
and
came
slowly
back
to
consciousness
of
what
was
going
on
at
first
he
was
too
close
to
the
hinterland
to
know
or
care
as
to
what
was
happening
here
though
he
did
vaguely
sense
that
he
had
left
the
lower
levels
of
hell
and
was
traversing
a
milder
purgatorial
region
he
did
not
question
alan
presence
or
recognize
him
alan
was
at
first
simply
another
of
those
distrusted
foreigners
whose
point
of
view
and
character
he
comprehended
as
little
as
he
did
their
jibbering
tongues
gradually
however
this
one
man
seemed
to
stand
out
from
the
others
and
finally
took
upon
himself
a
name
and
an
entity
by
and
by
dick
thought
when
he
was
so
as
he
was
just
now
he
would
wonder
why
alan
massey
was
here
and
would
try
to
recall
why
he
had
disliked
him
so
some
time
a
million
years
ago
or
so
he
did
not
dislike
him
now
he
was
too
weak
to
dislike
anybody
in
any
case
but
he
was
beginning
to
connect
alan
vaguely
but
surely
with
the
superior
cleanliness
and
comfort
and
care
with
which
he
was
now
surrounded
he
knew
now
that
he
had
been
sick
very
sick
and
that
he
was
getting
better
knew
that
before
long
he
would
find
himself
asking
questions
even
now
his
eyes
followed
alan
massey
as
the
latter
came
and
went
with
an
ever
more
insistent
wonderment
though
he
had
not
yet
the
force
of
will
or
body
to
voice
that
pursuing
question
as
to
why
alan
massey
was
here
apparently
taking
charge
of
his
own
slow
return
to
health
and
consciousness
meanwhile
alan
wired
tony
holiday
every
day
as
to
his
patient
condition
though
he
wrote
not
at
all
and
said
nothing
in
his
wires
of
himself
letters
from
tony
were
now
beginning
to
arrive
letters
full
of
eager
gratitude
and
love
for
alan
and
concern
for
dick
and
one
day
dick
mind
got
suddenly
very
clear
he
was
alone
with
the
nurse
at
the
time
the
sympathetic
american
one
whom
he
liked
better
and
was
less
afraid
of
than
he
was
of
the
stolid
inexorable
british
lady
and
he
began
to
ask
questions
many
questions
and
very
definite
ones
he
knew
at
last
precisely
what
it
was
he
wanted
to
know
he
got
a
good
deal
of
information
though
by
no
means
all
he
sought
he
found
out
that
he
had
been
taken
desperately
ill
that
he
had
been
summarily
removed
from
his
lodging
place
because
of
the
superstitious
dread
of
contagion
into
the
miserable
little
thatch
roofed
hut
in
which
he
had
nearly
died
thanks
to
the
of
the
rascally
drunken
doctor
and
the
ignorant
nurse
he
learned
how
alan
massey
had
suddenly
appeared
and
taken
things
in
his
own
hands
discovered
that
in
a
nutshell
the
fact
was
he
owed
his
life
to
the
but
why
that
was
what
he
had
to
find
out
from
alan
massey
himself
the
next
day
when
alan
came
in
and
the
nurse
went
out
he
asked
his
question
that
is
easy
said
alan
grimly
i
came
on
tony
account
dick
winced
of
course
that
was
it
tony
had
sent
massey
he
was
here
as
her
emissary
naturally
no
doubt
as
her
accepted
lover
it
was
kind
tony
was
always
kind
but
he
wished
she
had
not
done
it
he
did
not
want
to
have
his
life
saved
by
the
man
who
was
going
to
marry
tony
holiday
he
rather
thought
he
did
not
want
his
life
saved
anyway
by
anybody
he
wished
they
had
done
it
i
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
and
to
tony
he
said
a
little
stiffly
i
fear
it
it
was
hardly
worth
the
effort
his
eyes
closed
wearily
tony
did
send
me
though
observed
alan
massey
as
if
he
had
read
the
other
thought
i
sent
myself
dick
eyes
opened
that
is
odd
if
it
is
true
he
said
slowly
alan
dropped
into
a
chair
near
the
bed
it
is
odd
he
admitted
but
it
happens
to
be
true
it
came
about
simply
enough
when
tony
heard
you
were
sick
she
went
crazy
swore
she
was
coming
down
here
in
spite
of
us
all
to
take
care
of
you
then
miss
clay
child
died
and
she
had
to
go
on
the
boards
you
can
imagine
what
it
meant
to
her
the
two
things
coming
at
once
she
played
that
night
swept
everything
as
you
know
she
would
got
all
at
her
feet
dick
nodded
a
faint
flash
of
pleasure
in
his
eyes
down
and
out
as
he
was
he
could
still
be
glad
to
hear
of
tony
triumph
she
wanted
to
come
to
you
went
on
alan
she
let
me
come
instead
because
she
could
i
came
for
for
her
sake
dick
nodded
naturally
for
her
sake
he
said
i
could
hardly
have
expected
you
to
come
for
mine
i
would
hardly
have
expected
it
in
any
case
i
would
hardly
have
expected
it
of
myself
acknowledged
alan
with
a
wry
smile
but
i
had
rather
a
jolly
time
at
your
expense
i
always
enjoyed
working
miracles
and
if
you
could
have
seen
yourself
the
way
you
were
when
i
got
here
you
would
think
there
was
a
magic
in
it
somehow
i
evidently
owe
you
a
great
deal
massey
i
am
grateful
or
at
least
i
presume
i
shall
be
later
just
now
i
feel
a
little
dumb
my
dear
fellow
nothing
would
please
me
better
than
to
have
you
continue
dumb
on
that
subject
i
did
this
thing
as
i
done
most
things
in
my
life
to
please
myself
i
do
want
your
thanks
i
would
like
a
little
of
your
liking
though
you
and
i
are
likely
to
see
quite
a
bit
of
each
other
these
next
few
weeks
could
you
manage
to
forget
the
past
and
call
a
kind
of
truce
for
a
while
you
have
a
good
deal
to
forgive
me
perhaps
more
than
you
know
if
you
would
be
willing
to
let
the
little
i
have
done
down
here
and
mind
you
i
do
want
to
magnify
that
part
wipe
off
the
slate
i
should
be
glad
could
you
manage
it
carson
it
looks
as
if
it
hardly
could
be
magnified
said
dick
with
sudden
heartiness
i
spoke
grudgingly
just
now
i
am
afraid
please
overlook
it
i
am
more
than
grateful
for
all
you
have
done
and
more
than
glad
to
be
friends
if
you
want
it
i
do
hate
you
how
could
i
when
you
have
saved
my
life
and
anyway
i
never
hated
you
as
you
used
to
hate
me
i
often
wondered
why
you
did
especially
at
first
before
you
knew
how
much
i
cared
for
tony
and
even
that
should
have
made
you
hate
me
because
you
won
never
mind
why
i
hated
you
i
do
any
more
will
you
shake
hands
with
me
carson
so
we
can
begin
again
dick
pulled
himself
weakly
up
on
the
pillow
their
hands
met
hang
it
massey
dick
said
i
am
afraid
i
am
going
to
like
you
heard
you
were
hypnotic
i
believe
on
my
soul
you
came
down
here
to
make
me
like
you
did
you
but
alan
only
smiled
his
ironic
noncommital
smile
and
remarked
it
was
time
for
the
invalid
to
take
a
nap
he
had
had
enough
conversation
for
the
first
attempt
dick
soon
drifted
off
to
sleep
but
alan
massey
prowled
the
streets
of
the
mexican
city
far
into
the
night
with
tireless
driven
feet
the
demons
were
after
him
again
and
far
away
in
another
city
whose
bright
lights
glow
all
night
tony
holiday
was
still
playing
madge
to
packed
houses
happy
in
her
triumph
but
with
heart
very
pitiful
for
her
beloved
miss
clay
whose
sorrow
and
continued
illness
had
made
possible
the
fruition
of
her
own
eager
hopes
tony
was
sadly
lonely
without
alan
thought
of
him
far
more
often
and
with
deeper
affection
even
than
she
had
while
she
had
him
at
her
beck
and
call
in
the
city
loved
him
with
a
new
kind
of
love
for
his
generous
kindness
to
dick
she
made
up
her
mind
that
he
had
cleared
the
shield
forever
by
this
splendid
act
and
saw
no
reason
why
she
should
keep
him
any
longer
on
probation
surely
she
knew
by
this
time
that
he
was
a
man
even
a
holiday
might
be
proud
to
marry
she
wrote
this
decision
to
her
uncle
and
asked
to
be
relieved
from
her
promise
i
am
sorry
she
wrote
if
you
can
not
approve
but
i
can
not
help
it
i
love
him
and
i
am
going
to
be
engaged
to
him
as
soon
as
he
comes
back
to
new
york
if
he
wants
it
i
am
afraid
i
would
have
married
him
and
gone
to
mexico
with
him
given
up
the
play
and
broken
my
promise
to
you
if
he
would
have
let
me
it
goes
that
far
and
deep
with
me
people
are
crazy
over
his
pictures
the
exhibition
came
off
last
week
and
they
say
he
is
one
of
the
greatest
living
painters
with
a
wonderful
future
ahead
of
him
i
am
so
proud
and
happy
he
is
fine
everyway
now
has
really
sloughed
off
the
past
just
as
he
promised
he
would
so
please
dear
uncle
phil
forgive
me
if
i
do
what
you
do
want
me
to
i
have
to
marry
him
in
my
heart
i
am
married
to
him
already
and
this
was
the
letter
philip
holiday
found
at
his
place
at
breakfast
on
the
morning
of
the
day
geoffrey
annersley
was
expected
he
read
it
gravely
rash
loving
tony
where
was
she
going
ah
well
she
was
no
longer
a
child
to
be
protected
from
the
storm
and
stress
of
life
she
was
a
woman
grown
woman
enough
to
love
and
to
be
loved
greatly
to
sacrifice
and
suffer
if
need
be
for
love
mighty
sake
she
must
go
her
way
as
ted
had
gone
his
as
their
father
had
gone
his
before
them
he
could
only
pray
that
she
was
right
in
her
faith
that
for
love
of
her
alan
massey
had
been
born
anew
his
own
deep
affection
for
ned
children
seemed
at
the
moment
a
sadly
powerless
thing
he
had
coveted
the
best
things
of
life
for
them
happy
normal
ways
of
peace
and
gentle
living
yet
here
was
ted
at
twenty
already
lived
through
an
experience
tragic
enough
to
leave
its
scarlet
mark
for
all
the
rest
of
his
life
and
even
now
on
the
verge
of
voluntarily
entering
a
terrific
conflict
from
which
few
returned
alive
and
none
came
back
unchanged
here
was
tony
taking
upon
herself
the
thraldom
of
a
love
which
try
as
he
would
philip
holiday
could
not
see
in
any
other
light
but
as
at
best
a
cataclysmic
risk
and
at
this
very
hour
larry
might
be
learning
that
the
desire
of
his
heart
was
dust
and
ashes
his
hope
a
vain
thing
himself
an
exile
henceforth
from
the
things
that
round
out
a
man
life
make
it
full
and
rich
and
satisfying
and
yet
thinking
of
the
three
philip
holiday
found
one
clear
ray
of
comfort
with
all
their
vagaries
their
rash
impulsions
their
willful
blindness
their
recklessness
they
had
each
run
splendidly
true
to
type
not
one
of
the
three
had
failed
in
the
things
that
really
count
he
had
faith
that
none
of
them
ever
would
they
might
blunder
egregiously
suffer
immeasurably
pay
extravagantly
but
they
would
each
keep
that
vital
spirit
which
they
had
in
common
untarnished
and
undaunted
an
unconquerable
thing

geoffrey
annersley
arrives
there
were
few
passengers
alighting
from
the
south
bound
train
from
canada
larry
holiday
had
no
difficulty
in
picking
out
geoffrey
annersley
among
these
a
tall
young
man
wearing
the
british
uniform
and
supporting
himself
with
a
walking
stick
his
face
was
lean
and
bronzed
and
lined
the
face
of
a
man
who
has
seen
things
which
kill
youth
and
laughter
and
yet
a
serene
face
too
as
if
its
owner
had
found
that
after
all
nothing
mattered
very
much
if
you
looked
it
square
in
the
eye
larry
went
to
the
stranger
at
once
captain
annersley
he
asked
i
am
laurence
holiday
the
captain
set
down
his
bag
leaned
on
his
stick
deliberately
scrutinized
the
other
man
larry
returned
the
look
frankly
they
were
of
nearly
the
same
age
but
any
one
seeing
them
would
have
set
the
englishman
as
at
least
five
years
the
senior
of
the
young
doctor
geoffrey
annersley
had
been
trained
in
a
stern
school
a
man
does
not
wear
a
captain
bars
and
four
wound
stripes
for
nothing
then
the
englishman
held
out
his
hand
with
a
pleasant
and
unexpectedly
boyish
smile
so
you
are
larry
he
said
your
brother
sent
me
to
you
ted
you
have
seen
him
for
a
minute
larry
forgot
who
geoffrey
annersley
was
forgot
ruth
forgot
himself
remembered
only
ted
and
gave
his
guest
a
heartier
handshake
than
he
had
willed
for
his
kid
brother
sake
yes
i
was
with
him
day
before
yesterday
and
the
night
before
that
he
was
looking
jolly
well
and
sent
all
kinds
of
greetings
to
you
all
see
here
doctor
holiday
i
have
no
end
of
things
to
say
to
you
can
we
go
somewhere
and
talk
my
car
is
outside
you
will
come
up
to
the
house
will
you
not
we
are
all
expecting
you
larry
tried
hard
to
keep
his
voice
quiet
and
emotionless
not
for
anything
would
he
have
had
this
gallant
soldier
suspect
how
his
knees
were
trembling
delighted
bowed
the
captain
suavely
and
permitted
larry
to
take
his
bag
and
lead
the
way
to
the
car
nothing
more
was
said
until
the
two
men
were
seated
and
the
car
had
left
the
station
yard
i
am
afraid
i
should
have
made
my
wire
a
bit
more
explicit
observed
the
captain
turning
to
larry
my
wife
says
i
am
too
parsimonious
with
my
words
in
telegrams
a
british
trait
possibly
he
spoke
deliberately
and
his
keen
eyes
studied
his
companion
face
as
he
made
the
casual
remark
which
set
larry
brain
reeling
see
here
holiday
i
a
blunt
brute
i
do
know
how
to
break
things
gently
to
people
but
i
am
here
to
tell
you
if
you
care
to
know
that
elinor
ruth
farringdon
is
no
more
married
than
you
are
unless
she
is
married
to
you
that
was
her
mother
wedding
ring
lord
man
do
you
always
drive
a
car
like
this
i
been
all
but
killed
once
this
year
and
i
do
care
to
repeat
the
experiment
larry
grinned
flushed
apologized
and
moderated
the
speed
of
his
motor
he
wondered
that
he
could
drive
at
all
he
felt
strangely
light
as
if
he
were
stripped
of
his
body
and
were
nothing
but
spirit
do
you
mind
if
we
drive
about
a
bit
and
talk
things
over
before
i
see
elinor
ruth
as
you
call
her
i
funking
that
a
little
though
been
trying
ever
since
your
brother
told
me
the
story
to
get
used
to
the
idea
of
her
being
well
not
quite
right
you
know
but
i
stick
it
somehow
she
is
all
right
perfectly
normal
every
way
except
that
she
had
forgotten
things
larry
voice
was
faintly
indignant
he
resented
anybody
implying
that
ruth
was
queer
unbalanced
in
any
way
she
was
she
was
absolutely
sane
as
sane
as
captain
annersley
himself
considerably
more
sane
than
larry
holiday
could
take
oath
he
was
at
this
moment
good
heavens
is
that
enough
groaned
annersley
almost
equally
indignant
you
forget
or
rather
you
do
know
all
she
has
forgotten
i
know
i
was
brought
up
with
her
her
father
was
my
uncle
and
guardian
we
played
together
had
the
same
tutor
rode
the
same
ponies
got
into
the
same
jolly
old
scrapes
why
elinor
like
my
own
sister
man
i
swallow
her
forgetting
me
and
her
brother
rod
and
all
the
rest
as
easily
as
you
seem
to
do
it
well
it
the
limit
as
you
say
in
the
states
the
captain
wiped
his
forehead
on
which
great
drops
of
perspiration
stood
in
spite
of
the
january
chill
in
the
air
there
was
agitation
suppressed
vehemence
in
his
tone
i
suppose
it
is
natural
that
you
should
feel
that
way
larry
spoke
thoughtfully
as
he
turned
the
car
away
from
the
hill
in
response
to
his
guest
request
that
he
be
permitted
to
postpone
meeting
elinor
ruth
farringdon
a
little
while
the
remembering
part
has
bothered
me
so
much
maybe
i
was
very
keen
on
having
her
remember
maybe
i
was
afraid
she
would
remember
too
much
he
added
coloring
a
little
the
frown
on
his
companion
stern
young
face
melted
at
that
the
frank
boyish
smile
appeared
again
he
liked
larry
holiday
none
the
less
for
his
lack
of
pretense
he
understood
all
that
the
younger
holiday
had
taken
pains
to
make
things
perfectly
clear
to
him
he
knew
precisely
what
the
young
doctor
was
afraid
of
and
why
in
case
elinor
memory
returned
my
uncle
thinks
and
i
think
too
that
her
memory
will
come
back
now
that
it
has
the
external
stimulus
to
waken
it
larry
continued
i
be
surprised
if
seeing
you
would
give
the
necessary
impetus
in
fact
i
am
counting
on
that
very
thing
happening
hoping
for
it
with
all
my
might
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
i
was
glad
to
have
you
come
please
believe
that
i
should
have
been
glad
even
if
your
coming
had
made
her
remember
she
was
your
wife
of
course
her
recovery
is
the
main
thing
the
rest
is
a
side
issue
a
jolly
important
side
issue
i
take
it
for
her
and
for
you
i
not
a
stranger
doctor
holiday
i
am
elinor
ruth
farringdon
cousin
in
her
brother
absence
i
represent
her
family
and
in
that
capacity
i
would
like
to
say
before
i
am
a
minute
older
that
what
you
and
the
rest
of
you
holidays
have
done
for
elinor
passes
anything
i
know
of
for
sheer
fineness
and
generosity
i
not
a
man
of
words
war
would
have
knocked
them
out
of
me
if
i
had
been
but
when
i
remember
that
you
not
only
saved
elinor
life
but
took
care
of
her
afterward
when
she
apparently
had
a
friend
in
the
world
well
there
is
anything
i
can
say
but
thank
you
and
tell
you
that
if
there
is
ever
anything
i
can
do
in
return
for
you
or
yours
you
have
only
to
ask
neither
elinor
nor
i
can
ever
repay
you
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
is
unpayable
and
again
the
captain
wiped
his
perspiring
brow
he
was
deeply
moved
and
emotion
went
hard
with
his
temperament
we
did
nothing
but
what
anybody
would
have
been
glad
to
do
if
there
are
any
thanks
coming
they
are
chiefly
due
to
my
uncle
and
his
wife
but
we
do
any
of
us
want
thanks
we
love
ruth
please
forget
the
rest
we
would
rather
you
would
the
captain
nodded
quick
approval
he
had
been
told
americans
were
boasters
given
to
but
either
people
got
the
americans
wrong
or
these
holidays
were
an
exception
to
the
general
run
he
remembered
that
other
young
holiday
whom
he
had
met
rather
intimately
in
the
canadian
camp
there
had
been
no
side
there
either
his
modesty
had
been
one
of
his
chief
charms
and
here
was
the
brother
quietly
putting
aside
credit
for
a
course
of
conduct
which
was
simply
immense
in
its
quixotic
generosity
he
liked
these
holidays
there
was
something
rather
magnificent
about
their
simplicity
something
almost
british
he
thought
that
is
all
very
well
he
made
answer
i
wo
talk
about
it
if
you
prefer
but
you
will
pardon
me
if
i
do
forget
that
you
saved
my
cousin
life
and
looked
after
her
when
she
was
in
a
desperately
unhappy
situation
and
her
own
people
seemed
to
have
utterly
deserted
her
and
i
consider
my
running
into
your
brother
at
camp
one
of
the
sheerest
pieces
of
good
luck
i
had
these
many
days
on
all
counts
how
did
it
happen
asked
larry
i
was
doing
some
recruiting
work
in
the
vicinity
and
they
asked
me
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
lads
in
training
i
did
your
brother
was
there
and
lost
no
time
in
getting
in
touch
with
me
when
he
heard
who
i
was
and
jolly
pleased
i
was
to
hear
his
story
all
of
it
the
speaker
smiled
at
his
companion
i
mean
that
larry
holiday
elinor
and
i
were
kid
sweethearts
we
used
to
swear
we
were
going
to
get
married
when
we
grew
up
that
was
when
she
was
eight
and
i
a
man
of
twelve
or
so
i
gave
her
the
locket
which
made
some
of
the
trouble
as
a
sort
of
hostage
for
the
future
we
called
her
ruth
in
those
days
it
was
her
own
fancy
to
change
it
to
elinor
later
she
thought
it
more
grown
up
and
dignified
i
remember
then
i
went
back
to
england
to
school
i
did
see
her
again
until
we
were
both
grown
up
and
then
i
married
her
best
friend
with
her
blessing
and
approval
but
that
is
another
story
just
now
i
am
trying
to
tell
you
that
i
am
ready
to
congratulate
my
cousin
with
all
my
heart
if
it
happens
that
you
want
to
marry
her
as
your
brother
seems
to
think
there
is
no
doubt
about
what
i
want
said
larry
grimly
whether
it
is
what
she
wants
is
another
matter
we
have
been
exactly
in
a
position
to
discuss
marriage
i
understand
i
beastly
sorry
to
have
been
such
an
infernal
dog
in
the
manger
unwittingly
the
only
thing
i
can
do
to
make
up
is
to
give
my
blessing
and
wish
you
best
of
luck
in
your
wooing
shall
we
shake
on
it
larry
holiday
and
on
the
friendship
i
hope
you
and
i
are
going
to
have
and
with
a
cordial
man
to
man
grip
there
was
cemented
a
friendship
which
was
to
last
as
long
as
they
both
lived
to
relate
briefly
the
links
of
the
story
some
of
which
larry
holiday
now
heard
as
the
car
sped
over
the
smooth
frost
hardened
roads
which
the
open
winter
had
left
unusually
snowless
and
clean
geoffrey
annersley
had
been
going
his
careless
happy
go
lucky
way
as
an
oxford
undergraduate
when
the
sudden
firing
of
a
far
off
shot
had
startled
the
world
and
made
war
the
one
inevitable
fact
the
young
man
had
enlisted
promptly
and
had
been
in
practically
continuous
service
of
one
sort
or
another
ever
since
he
had
gone
through
desperate
fighting
been
four
times
wounded
and
was
now
at
last
definitely
eliminated
from
active
service
by
a
leg
the
result
of
his
last
visit
to
blighty
he
had
been
invalided
the
previous
spring
and
had
been
sent
to
australia
on
a
recruiting
mission
here
he
had
renewed
his
acquaintance
with
his
cousins
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
years
and
promptly
fell
in
love
with
and
married
pretty
nancy
hallinger
his
cousin
elinor
chum
the
speedy
wooing
accomplished
as
well
as
the
recruiting
job
which
was
dispatched
equally
expeditiously
and
thoroughly
geoffrey
prepared
to
return
to
france
to
get
in
some
more
good
work
against
the
huns
while
his
wife
planned
to
enter
red
cross
service
as
a
nurse
for
which
she
had
been
in
training
for
some
time
roderick
had
entered
the
australian
air
service
and
was
already
in
flanders
where
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
youngest
and
most
reckless
aviators
flying
which
was
saying
considerable
it
was
imperative
that
some
arrangement
be
made
for
elinor
who
obviously
could
not
be
left
alone
in
sydney
it
was
decided
in
family
conclave
that
she
should
go
to
america
and
accept
the
often
proffered
hospitality
of
her
aunt
for
a
time
at
least
a
cable
to
this
effect
had
been
dispatched
to
wright
which
as
later
appeared
never
reached
that
lady
as
she
was
already
on
her
way
to
england
and
died
there
shortly
after
geoffrey
had
been
exceedingly
reluctant
to
have
his
young
cousin
take
the
long
journey
alone
though
she
had
laughed
at
his
fears
and
his
wife
had
abetted
her
in
her
disregard
of
possible
disastrous
consequences
telling
him
that
women
no
longer
required
wrapping
in
tissue
paper
the
war
had
changed
all
that
at
his
insistence
however
ruth
had
finally
consented
to
wear
her
wedding
ring
as
a
sort
of
shadowy
protection
he
had
an
idea
that
the
small
gold
band
being
presumptive
evidence
of
an
existing
male
guardian
somewhere
in
the
offing
might
serve
to
keep
away
the
ill
intentioned
or
over
bold
from
his
lovely
little
heiress
cousin
about
whom
he
worried
to
no
small
degree
they
had
gone
their
separate
ways
he
to
the
fierce
fighting
of
may
nineteen
hundred
and
sixteen
she
to
her
long
journey
and
subsequent
strange
adventures
at
first
no
one
had
thought
it
unnatural
that
they
heard
nothing
from
elinor
letters
went
easily
astray
those
days
geoffrey
was
weeks
without
news
even
from
his
wife
and
poor
roderick
was
by
this
time
beyond
communication
of
any
kind
his
name
labeled
with
that
saddest
of
all
tags
missing
it
was
not
until
geoffrey
was
out
of
commission
with
that
last
worst
knock
out
lying
insensible
more
dead
than
alive
in
a
hospital
somewhere
in
france
that
the
others
began
to
realize
that
elinor
had
vanished
utterly
from
the
ken
of
all
who
knew
her
some
one
who
knew
her
by
sight
had
chanced
to
see
her
in
california
and
had
noted
the
wedding
ring
hence
the
unsubstantiated
rumor
of
her
marriage
in
san
francisco
a
rumor
which
nancy
half
frantic
over
her
husband
desperate
illness
was
the
only
person
who
was
in
a
position
to
explain
when
geoffrey
came
slowly
back
to
the
land
of
the
living
it
was
to
learn
that
his
cousin
roderick
was
still
reported
missing
and
that
elinor
was
even
more
sadly
and
mysteriously
vanished
from
the
face
of
the
earth
in
spite
of
all
effort
to
discover
her
fate
it
had
been
a
tragic
coming
back
for
the
sick
man
but
an
englishman
is
hard
to
down
and
gradually
he
got
back
health
and
a
degree
of
hope
and
happiness
there
would
be
no
more
fighting
for
him
but
the
war
department
assured
him
there
were
plenty
of
other
ways
in
which
he
could
serve
the
cause
and
he
had
readily
placed
himself
at
their
disposal
for
the
recruiting
work
in
which
he
had
already
demonstrated
his
power
to
success
in
australia
which
brings
us
to
the
canadian
training
camp
and
ted
holiday
captain
annersley
had
been
asked
as
he
had
told
larry
to
speak
to
the
boys
he
had
done
so
given
a
little
straight
talk
of
what
lay
ahead
of
them
and
what
they
were
fighting
for
bade
them
get
in
a
few
extra
licks
for
him
since
he
was
out
of
it
for
good
done
for
crocked
in
conclusion
he
had
begged
them
give
the
huns
hell
it
was
all
he
asked
of
them
and
from
the
look
of
them
he
jolly
well
knew
they
would
do
it
while
he
was
speaking
he
was
aware
all
the
time
of
a
tall
youth
who
stood
leaning
against
a
post
with
a
kind
of
nonchalant
grace
the
boy
pose
had
been
indolent
but
his
eyes
had
been
wide
awake
earnest
responsive
little
by
little
the
captain
found
himself
talking
directly
to
the
lad
what
he
was
saying
might
be
over
the
heads
of
some
of
them
but
not
this
chap
he
got
you
as
the
americans
say
he
had
the
vision
would
go
wherever
the
speaker
could
take
him
one
saw
that
afterwards
the
boy
had
sought
out
the
recruiter
to
ask
if
by
any
chance
he
knew
a
girl
named
elinor
ruth
farringdon
it
had
been
rather
a
tremendous
moment
for
both
of
them
each
had
plenty
to
say
that
the
other
wanted
to
hear
but
the
full
story
had
to
wait
corporal
holiday
run
around
loose
even
talking
to
a
distinguished
british
officer
there
would
have
to
be
special
dispensation
for
that
and
special
dispensations
take
time
in
an
army
world
it
would
be
forthcoming
however
in
the
meantime
geoffrey
annersley
had
heard
enough
to
want
to
know
a
great
deal
more
and
thought
he
might
as
well
make
some
inquiries
on
his
own
he
wanted
to
find
out
who
these
american
holidays
were
one
of
whom
had
apparently
saved
his
cousin
elinor
life
and
all
of
whom
had
one
concluded
been
amazingly
kind
to
her
though
the
boy
had
gracefully
made
light
of
that
side
of
the
thing
in
the
brief
synopsis
of
events
he
had
had
time
to
give
to
the
englishman
the
captain
had
taken
a
fancy
to
the
narrator
and
was
not
averse
to
beginning
his
investigation
as
to
the
holiday
family
with
the
young
corporal
himself
accordingly
he
tackled
the
boy
commanding
officer
a
young
colonel
with
whom
he
chanced
to
be
dining
the
colonel
was
willing
to
talk
and
geoffrey
annersley
discovered
that
young
holiday
was
rather
by
way
of
being
a
he
had
enlisted
as
a
private
only
a
short
time
ago
but
had
been
shot
speedily
into
his
corporalship
time
pressed
officers
were
needed
the
boy
was
officer
stuff
he
would
stay
a
corporal
if
all
went
well
he
would
go
over
as
a
sergeant
we
put
him
through
though
just
at
first
handled
him
rather
nasty
the
colonel
admitted
with
a
reminiscent
twinkle
we
do
put
the
americans
through
somehow
though
it
is
that
we
have
any
grudge
against
we
have
we
like
most
of
and
we
have
to
admit
it
rather
decent
of
them
to
be
here
at
all
when
they
do
have
to
all
the
same
we
give
an
extra
twist
of
the
discipline
crank
on
general
principles
just
to
see
what
they
are
made
of
we
found
out
mighty
quick
with
this
youngster
he
took
it
all
and
came
back
for
more
with
a
and
a
salute
and
a
devilish
debonair
kind
of
grin
that
would
have
disarmed
a
turk
he
does
look
precisely
meek
to
me
annersley
had
said
remembering
the
answering
flash
he
had
caught
in
those
blue
eyes
when
he
was
begging
the
boys
to
get
in
an
extra
lick
against
the
huns
for
his
sake
meek
nothing
he
has
more
spirit
than
any
cub
we
had
to
get
into
shape
this
many
a
moon
it
is
that
it
is
just
that
he
has
the
right
idea
had
it
from
the
start
however
he
came
by
it
you
know
what
it
is
captain
it
is
obedience
first
last
and
all
the
time
the
will
to
be
willed
a
soldier
job
is
to
do
what
he
is
told
whether
he
likes
it
or
not
whether
it
is
his
job
or
not
whether
it
makes
sense
or
not
whether
he
gets
his
orders
from
a
man
he
looks
up
to
and
respects
or
whether
he
gets
them
from
a
low
down
cur
that
he
knows
perfectly
well
is
fit
to
black
his
boots
none
of
that
makes
any
difference
it
is
up
to
him
to
do
what
he
is
told
and
he
does
it
without
a
kick
if
he
wise
young
holiday
is
wise
he
had
his
medicine
sometime
one
sees
that
i
do
know
why
he
dropped
down
on
us
like
a
shooting
star
the
way
he
did
some
college
fiasco
i
understand
he
does
talk
about
himself
or
his
affairs
though
he
is
a
frank
outspoken
youngster
in
other
ways
but
there
was
a
look
in
his
eyes
when
he
came
to
us
that
most
boys
of
twenty
do
have
thank
the
lord
and
it
is
that
look
or
what
is
behind
it
that
has
made
him
ace
high
here
that
boy
struck
bottom
somewhere
and
struck
it
hard
i
bet
my
best
belt
on
that
this
interested
geoffrey
annersley
he
thought
he
understood
what
the
colonel
meant
there
was
something
in
ted
holiday
eyes
which
betrayed
that
he
had
already
been
under
fire
somehow
he
had
seen
it
himself
he
is
as
smart
as
they
make
went
on
the
colonel
quick
as
a
flash
to
think
and
to
see
and
to
act
never
loses
his
head
and
he
a
wonder
with
the
men
jollies
along
when
they
are
grousing
or
homesick
sets
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
when
they
are
has
a
pat
on
the
shoulder
for
this
one
and
a
jeer
for
that
one
old
and
young
they
are
all
crazy
about
him
they
go
anywhere
he
led
i
tell
you
he
the
stuff
that
will
take
over
the
top
and
make
the
boches
feel
cold
in
the
pit
of
their
fat
tumtums
when
they
see
him
coming
lord
but
the
uselessness
of
it
though
he
get
killed
his
kind
always
does
they
are
always
in
front
they
are
made
that
way
ca
help
it
sometimes
they
do
come
through
though
the
colonel
flashed
a
quick
admiring
glance
at
his
guest
who
had
also
been
the
kind
that
was
always
in
front
and
yet
had
somehow
by
the
grace
of
something
come
through
in
spite
of
the
hazards
he
had
run
and
the
deaths
he
had
all
but
died
you
are
a
living
witness
to
that
little
fact
he
added
lord
love
us
it
all
in
the
game
anyway
and
a
man
can
die
but
once
the
next
day
corporal
holiday
was
given
a
brief
leave
of
absence
from
camp
at
the
request
of
the
distinguished
british
officer
together
the
two
went
over
the
strange
story
of
elinor
ruth
farringdon
and
the
holidays
connection
with
the
later
chapters
thereof
they
decided
not
to
write
to
the
hill
as
annersley
was
planning
to
go
to
boston
next
day
whence
he
was
to
return
soon
to
england
his
mission
accomplished
and
could
easily
stop
over
in
dunbury
on
his
way
and
set
things
right
in
person
perhaps
even
by
his
personal
presence
renew
ruth
memory
of
things
she
had
forgotten
all
through
the
pleasant
dinner
hour
ted
kept
wishing
he
could
get
the
captain
to
talking
about
himself
and
his
battle
experiences
and
had
no
idea
at
all
that
he
himself
was
being
shrewdly
studied
as
they
talked
good
breeding
good
the
captain
summed
up
if
he
is
a
fair
sample
of
young
america
then
young
america
is
a
bit
of
all
right
and
if
he
is
a
fair
sample
of
the
holiday
family
then
elinor
had
indeed
fallen
into
the
best
of
hands
praise
be
he
wondered
more
than
once
what
the
own
story
was
what
was
the
nature
of
the
fiasco
which
had
driven
him
into
the
canadian
training
camp
and
what
was
behind
that
unboyish
look
which
came
now
and
then
into
his
boyish
eyes
later
during
the
intimate
evening
over
their
cigarettes
both
had
their
curiosity
gratified
captain
annersley
was
moved
to
relate
some
of
his
hair
breadth
escapes
and
thrilling
moments
to
an
alert
and
hero
worshiping
listener
and
later
still
ted
too
waxed
autobiographical
in
response
to
some
clever
baiting
of
which
he
was
entirely
unaware
though
he
did
wonder
afterward
how
he
had
happened
to
tell
the
thing
he
had
kept
most
secret
to
an
entire
stranger
it
was
an
immense
relief
to
the
boy
to
talk
it
all
out
it
would
never
haunt
him
again
in
quite
the
same
way
now
he
had
once
broken
the
barriers
of
his
reserve
geoffrey
annersley
served
his
purpose
for
ted
as
well
as
larry
holiday
annersley
was
immensely
interested
in
the
confession
it
matched
very
well
he
thought
with
that
other
story
of
a
gallant
young
holiday
to
whom
his
cousin
elinor
owed
so
much
in
more
than
one
way
they
were
a
queer
lot
these
holidays
they
had
the
courage
of
their
convictions
and
tilted
at
windmills
right
valiantly
it
seemed
and
then
he
fell
to
talking
straight
talk
to
ted
holiday
saying
things
that
only
a
man
who
has
lived
deeply
can
say
with
any
effect
he
urged
the
boy
not
to
worry
about
that
smash
of
his
it
was
past
history
over
and
done
with
he
must
look
ahead
not
back
and
be
thankful
he
had
come
out
as
well
as
he
had
there
is
just
one
other
thing
i
want
to
say
he
added
you
think
you
have
had
your
lesson
maybe
it
is
enough
but
you
find
it
a
jolly
lot
easier
to
slip
up
over
there
than
it
is
at
home
you
lose
your
sense
of
values
when
there
is
death
and
damnation
going
all
around
you
get
to
feeling
you
have
a
right
to
take
anything
that
comes
your
way
to
even
it
up
anyway
i
felt
that
way
until
i
met
the
girl
i
wanted
to
marry
then
the
rest
looked
almighty
different
i
given
nancy
the
best
i
had
to
give
but
it
was
good
enough
she
deserved
more
than
i
could
give
her
that
is
plain
speaking
holiday
men
say
war
excuses
justify
anything
it
does
do
anything
of
the
sort
some
day
you
will
be
wanting
to
marry
a
girl
yourself
do
let
anything
happen
in
this
next
year
over
there
that
you
will
regret
for
a
that
is
a
queer
preachment
and
a
jolly
rotten
preacher
but
somehow
i
felt
i
had
to
say
it
you
can
remember
it
or
forget
it
as
you
like
ted
lit
another
cigarette
looked
up
straight
into
geoffrey
war
lined
face
thank
you
he
said
i
think
i
remember
it
anyway
i
appreciate
your
saying
it
to
me
that
way
the
subject
dropped
then
went
back
to
war
and
how
men
feel
on
the
edge
of
death
of
the
unimportance
of
death
anyway
chapter
xxxvi
the
past
and
future
meet
larry
knocked
at
ruth
door
it
opened
and
a
wan
and
pathetically
drooping
little
figure
stood
before
him
ever
since
she
had
been
awake
ruth
had
been
haunted
by
that
unwelcome
bit
of
memory
illumination
which
had
come
the
night
before
no
wonder
she
drooped
and
scarcely
dared
to
lift
her
eyes
to
her
lover
face
but
in
a
moment
he
had
her
in
his
arms
a
performance
which
banished
the
droop
and
brought
a
lovely
color
back
into
the
pale
cheeks
larry
oh
larry
is
it
all
right
i
not
his
wife
he
did
marry
me
larry
kissed
her
he
did
marry
you
nobody
going
to
marry
you
but
me
no
i
mean
to
say
that
now
forget
it
sweetheart
you
are
free
and
if
you
want
to
say
so
i
let
you
go
if
you
do
want
but
i
do
want
she
interrupted
i
want
larry
holiday
and
he
is
all
i
want
why
wo
you
ever
ever
believe
i
love
you
i
do
more
than
anything
in
the
world
you
darling
will
you
marry
me
i
should
have
asked
you
that
other
time
i
had
the
right
but
i
have
now
will
you
ruth
i
want
you
so
and
i
waited
so
long
listen
to
me
larry
holiday
ruth
held
up
a
small
warning
forefinger
i
marry
you
if
you
will
promise
never
never
to
be
cross
to
me
again
i
have
shed
quarts
of
tears
because
you
were
so
unkind
and
faithless
i
ought
to
make
you
do
some
terrible
penance
for
thinking
the
money
or
anything
but
you
mattered
to
me
not
even
the
wedding
ring
mattered
i
told
you
so
but
still
you
would
believe
larry
shook
his
head
remorsefully
rub
it
in
sweetheart
if
you
must
i
deserve
it
but
do
you
think
i
have
had
purgatory
enough
because
i
did
dare
believe
to
punish
me
for
anything
as
for
the
rest
i
know
i
been
behaving
like
a
brute
i
a
devil
of
a
disposition
and
i
been
half
crazy
anyway
not
that
that
is
any
excuse
but
i
behave
myself
in
the
future
honest
i
will
ruthie
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
lift
this
small
finger
of
yours
he
indicated
the
digit
by
a
loverly
kiss
and
i
be
as
meek
and
lowly
as
as
an
ash
can
he
finished
prosaically
ruth
happy
laughter
rang
out
at
this
and
she
put
up
her
lips
for
a
kiss
i
remember
she
said
you
not
a
brute
larry
you
a
darling
and
i
love
you
oh
immensely
and
i
marry
you
just
as
quick
as
ever
i
can
and
we
be
so
happy
you
wo
ever
remember
you
have
a
disposition
another
interim
occurred
an
interim
occupied
by
things
which
are
nobody
business
and
which
anybody
who
has
ever
been
in
love
can
supply
ad
lib
by
exercise
of
memory
and
imagination
then
hand
in
hand
the
two
went
down
to
where
geoffrey
annersley
waited
to
bring
back
the
past
to
elinor
farringdon
does
he
know
me
queried
ruth
as
they
descended
he
surely
does
he
knows
all
there
is
to
know
about
you
miss
elinor
ruth
farringdon
he
ought
to
he
is
your
cousin
and
he
married
your
best
friend
nan
wait
cried
ruth
excitedly
it
coming
back
he
married
nancy
hollinger
and
she
gave
me
some
san
francisco
addresses
of
some
friends
of
hers
just
before
i
sailed
they
were
in
that
envelope
i
threw
away
the
addresses
when
i
left
san
francisco
and
tucked
my
tickets
into
it
why
larry
i
remembering
really
remembering
she
stopped
short
on
the
stairs
to
exclaim
in
a
startled
incredulous
tone
of
course
you
are
remembering
sweetheart
echoed
larry
happily
come
on
down
and
remember
the
rest
with
annersley
help
he
is
some
cousin
you
better
be
prepared
to
be
horribly
proud
of
him
he
is
a
captain
and
wears
all
kinds
of
honorable
and
distinguished
dingle
dangles
and
decorations
as
well
as
a
romantic
limp
and
a
magnificent
gash
on
his
cheek
which
he
evidently
did
get
shaving
larry
jested
because
he
knew
ruth
was
growing
nervous
he
could
feel
her
tremble
against
his
arm
he
was
more
than
a
little
anxious
as
to
the
outcome
of
the
thing
itself
the
shock
and
the
strain
of
meeting
geoffrey
annersley
were
going
to
be
rather
an
ordeal
he
knew
they
entered
the
living
room
and
paused
on
the
threshold
larry
arm
still
around
the
girl
doctor
holiday
and
the
captain
both
rose
the
latter
limped
gallantly
toward
ruth
who
stared
at
him
an
instant
and
then
flung
herself
away
from
larry
into
the
other
man
arms
geoff
geoff
she
cried
for
a
moment
nothing
more
was
said
then
ruth
drew
herself
away
geoffrey
annersley
why
did
you
ever
ever
make
me
wear
that
horrid
ring
she
demanded
reproachfully
larry
and
i
could
have
married
each
other
months
ago
if
you
had
it
was
the
silliest
idea
anyway
and
all
your
fault
everything
he
laughed
at
that
a
big
hearty
laugh
that
came
from
the
depths
of
him
that
sounds
natural
he
said
every
scrape
you
ever
enticed
me
into
as
a
kid
was
always
my
fault
somehow
are
you
real
elinor
i
ca
help
thinking
i
am
seeing
a
ghost
do
you
really
remember
me
anxiously
of
course
i
remember
you
listen
geoff
listen
hard
and
unexpectedly
ruth
pursed
her
pretty
lips
and
whistled
a
merry
lilting
bar
of
melody
by
jove
exulted
the
captain
that
does
sound
like
old
times
do
tell
me
i
do
remember
she
flashed
back
happy
and
excited
beyond
measure
at
playing
this
new
remembering
game
that
was
our
special
call
yours
and
rod
and
mine
oh
rod
and
at
that
all
the
joy
went
out
of
the
eager
flushed
face
she
went
back
into
her
arms
again
sobbing
in
heart
breaking
fashion
the
turning
tide
of
memory
had
brought
back
wreckage
of
grief
as
well
as
joy
in
geoffrey
annersley
arms
ruth
mourned
her
brother
loss
for
the
first
time
larry
sent
his
uncle
a
quick
look
and
went
out
of
the
room
the
older
doctor
followed
ruth
and
her
cousin
were
left
alone
to
pick
up
the
dropped
threads
of
the
past
they
all
met
again
at
luncheon
however
ruth
rosy
cheeked
excited
and
but
on
the
whole
none
the
worse
for
her
journey
back
into
the
land
of
forgotten
things
as
larry
had
hoped
the
external
stimulus
of
actually
seeing
and
hearing
somebody
out
of
that
other
life
was
enough
to
start
the
train
what
she
did
not
yet
remember
geoffrey
supplied
and
little
by
little
the
past
took
on
shape
and
substance
and
elinor
ruth
farringdon
became
once
more
a
normal
human
being
with
a
past
as
well
as
a
present
which
was
dazzlingly
delightful
save
for
the
one
dark
blur
of
her
dear
rod
unknown
fate
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
at
table
geoffrey
addressed
his
cousin
as
elinor
and
was
promptly
informed
that
she
was
elinor
and
was
ruth
and
that
he
was
to
call
her
by
that
name
or
run
the
risk
of
being
disapproved
of
very
heartily
he
laughed
amused
at
this
now
i
know
you
are
real
he
said
it
is
exactly
the
tone
you
used
when
you
issued
the
contrary
command
and
by
jove
almost
the
same
words
except
for
the
reversed
titles
call
me
ruth
geoff
he
mimicked
am
not
going
to
be
ruth
any
more
i
am
going
to
be
elinor
it
is
a
much
prettier
name
well
i
do
think
so
now
retorted
ruth
i
changed
my
mind
again
i
think
ruth
is
the
nicest
name
there
is
because
well
she
blushed
adorably
and
looked
across
the
table
at
the
young
doctor
because
larry
likes
it
she
completed
half
defiantly
is
that
meant
to
be
an
official
publishing
of
the
bans
teased
her
cousin
when
the
laugh
that
ruth
naïve
confession
had
raised
subsided
leaving
larry
as
well
as
ruth
a
little
hot
of
cheek
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
said
ruth
larry
i
think
you
might
say
something
not
leave
me
everything
to
do
myself
tell
them
we
are
engaged
and
are
going
to
be
married
put
in
larry
suddenly
pushing
back
his
chair
and
going
over
to
stand
behind
ruth
a
hand
on
either
shoulder
facing
the
others
gallantly
if
obviously
also
embarrassedly
over
her
shyly
bent
blonde
head
the
blonde
head
went
up
at
that
and
was
shaken
very
decidedly
no
indeed
that
is
right
at
all
she
objected
do
listen
to
him
anybody
it
is
going
to
be
tomorrow
i
got
to
have
a
wedding
dress
and
it
takes
at
least
a
week
to
dream
a
wedding
dress
when
it
is
the
only
time
you
ever
intend
to
be
married
i
have
all
the
other
things
everything
i
need
down
to
the
last
hair
pin
and
powder
puff
that
why
i
went
to
boston
i
knew
i
was
going
to
want
pretty
clothes
quick
i
told
doctor
holiday
so
she
sent
a
charming
half
merry
half
deprecating
smile
at
the
older
doctor
who
smiled
back
she
most
assuredly
did
he
corroborated
i
never
suspected
it
was
part
of
a
deep
laid
plot
however
i
thought
it
was
just
femininity
cropping
out
after
a
dull
season
how
was
i
to
know
it
was
because
you
were
planning
to
run
off
with
my
assistant
that
you
wanted
all
the
gay
plumage
he
teased
ruth
made
a
dainty
little
grimace
at
that
that
is
a
fair
way
to
put
it
she
declared
if
i
had
been
planning
to
run
away
with
larry
or
he
with
me
we
would
have
done
it
months
ago
plumage
or
no
plumage
i
wanted
to
but
he
would
anyway
she
confessed
i
like
this
way
much
much
better
though
i
do
want
to
be
married
anywhere
except
right
here
in
the
heart
of
the
house
on
the
hill
she
slipped
out
of
her
chair
and
away
from
larry
hands
at
that
and
went
over
to
where
doctor
philip
sat
may
we
she
asked
like
a
child
asking
permission
to
run
out
and
play
it
is
what
we
all
want
more
than
anything
in
the
world
dear
child
he
said
you
belong
with
larry
in
our
hearts
as
well
as
in
the
heart
of
the
house
you
know
that
do
you
i
know
you
are
the
dearest
man
that
ever
was
not
even
excepting
larry
and
i
am
going
to
kiss
you
uncle
phil
so
there
i
can
call
you
that
now
ca
i
i
always
wanted
to
and
fitting
the
deed
to
the
word
ruth
bent
over
and
gave
doctor
philip
a
fluttering
little
butterfly
kiss
they
rose
from
the
table
at
that
and
ruth
was
bidden
go
off
to
her
room
and
get
a
long
rest
after
her
too
exciting
morning
larry
soberly
repaired
to
the
office
and
received
patients
and
prescribed
gravely
for
them
just
as
if
his
inner
self
were
not
executing
wild
fandangoes
of
joy
perhaps
his
patients
did
get
a
few
waves
of
his
happiness
however
for
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
did
not
leave
the
office
with
greater
hope
and
strength
and
courage
than
he
brought
there
the
young
doctor
getting
to
be
a
lot
like
his
uncle
one
of
them
said
to
his
wife
later
just
the
very
touch
of
his
hand
made
me
feel
better
today
sort
of
toned
up
as
if
i
had
had
an
electrical
treatment
queer
how
human
beings
can
shoot
sparks
sometimes
not
so
queer
larry
holiday
had
just
been
himself
electrified
by
love
and
joy
no
wonder
he
had
new
power
that
day
and
was
a
better
healer
than
he
had
ever
been
before
in
the
living
room
doctor
philip
and
captain
annersley
held
converse
the
captain
expressed
his
opinion
that
ruth
should
go
at
once
to
australia
if
her
brother
is
dead
as
we
have
every
reason
to
fear
elinor
ruth
is
the
sole
owner
of
an
immense
amount
of
property
the
lawyers
are
about
crazy
trying
to
keep
things
going
without
either
roderick
or
ruth
they
have
been
begging
me
to
come
out
and
take
charge
of
things
for
months
but
i
have
been
able
to
see
my
way
clear
owing
to
one
thing
or
another
somebody
will
have
to
go
at
once
and
of
course
it
should
be
ruth
how
would
it
do
for
her
and
laurence
both
to
go
magnificent
i
was
hoping
you
would
think
that
was
a
feasible
project
they
will
be
glad
to
have
a
man
to
represent
the
family
my
cousin
knows
nothing
about
the
business
end
of
the
thing
she
has
always
approached
it
exclusively
from
the
spending
side
do
you
think
your
nephew
would
care
to
settle
there
possibly
said
the
doctor
that
will
develop
later
they
will
have
to
work
that
out
for
themselves
i
am
rather
sorry
he
is
going
to
marry
a
girl
with
so
much
money
but
i
suppose
it
can
not
be
helped
some
people
would
look
at
it
that
way
doctor
holiday
grinned
the
captain
but
i
am
prepared
to
accept
the
fact
that
you
holidays
are
in
a
class
by
yourselves
we
have
always
been
afraid
that
elinor
would
be
a
victim
of
some
miserable
fortune
hunter
i
ca
tell
you
what
a
relief
it
is
to
have
her
marry
a
man
like
your
nephew
i
am
only
sorry
he
had
to
go
through
such
a
punishing
period
of
suspense
waiting
for
his
happiness
since
there
was
really
the
slightest
obstacle
i
rather
wish
he
had
cut
his
scruples
and
married
her
long
ago
i
do
agreed
with
you
captain
they
are
neither
of
them
worse
off
for
waiting
and
being
absolutely
sure
that
this
is
what
they
both
want
if
he
had
taken
the
risk
and
married
her
when
he
knew
he
had
the
full
right
to
do
it
he
would
have
been
miserable
and
made
her
more
so
larry
is
an
odd
chap
there
is
a
morbid
streak
in
him
he
would
have
forgiven
himself
if
he
had
done
it
and
losing
his
own
would
have
been
the
worst
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
him
no
amount
of
actual
legality
could
have
made
up
for
starting
out
on
a
spiritually
illegal
basis
we
holidays
have
to
keep
on
moderately
good
terms
with
ourselves
to
be
happy
he
added
with
a
quiet
smile
i
suppose
you
are
right
admitted
the
englishman
anyway
the
thing
is
straight
and
clear
now
he
has
earned
every
bit
of
happiness
that
is
coming
to
him
and
i
hope
it
is
going
to
be
a
great
deal
my
own
sense
of
indebtness
for
all
you
holidays
have
done
for
ruth
is
enormous
i
wish
there
were
some
way
of
making
adequate
returns
for
it
all
but
it
is
too
big
to
be
repaid
i
may
be
able
to
keep
an
eye
on
your
other
nephew
when
he
gets
over
i
certainly
should
like
to
i
do
know
when
i
taken
such
a
fancy
to
a
lad
my
word
he
is
a
ripping
sort
ted
doctor
holiday
smiled
a
little
well
yes
i
suppose
he
is
what
you
britishers
call
ripping
it
has
been
rather
ripping
in
another
sense
being
his
guardian
sometimes
i
judge
so
by
his
own
account
of
himself
yoxi
must
let
that
smash
of
his
worry
you
he
find
something
over
there
that
will
be
worth
a
hundred
times
what
any
college
can
give
him
and
as
for
the
rest
half
the
lads
of
mettle
in
the
world
come
to
earth
with
a
jolt
over
a
girl
sooner
or
later
and
they
do
all
rise
up
out
of
the
dust
as
clean
as
he
did
by
a
long
shot
so
he
told
you
about
that
affair
you
must
have
gotten
under
his
skin
rather
surprisingly
ted
does
talk
much
about
himself
and
i
fancy
he
has
talked
about
that
thing
at
all
to
any
one
it
went
deep
i
know
he
shows
that
in
a
hundred
ways
but
it
has
crushed
him
or
made
him
reckless
it
simply
steadied
him
and
i
infer
he
needed
some
steadying
doctor
holiday
nodded
assent
to
that
and
asked
if
he
thought
the
boy
was
doing
well
up
there
not
a
doubt
of
it
said
the
englishman
heartily
and
he
added
a
brief
synopsis
of
the
things
that
the
colonel
had
said
in
regard
to
his
youngest
corporal
that
is
rather
astonishing
remarked
doctor
holiday
obedience
has
ever
been
one
of
ted
strong
points
in
fact
he
has
been
a
rebel
always
most
boys
are
until
they
perceive
that
there
is
sense
instead
of
tyranny
in
law
your
nephew
has
had
that
knocked
into
him
rather
hard
and
he
is
all
the
better
for
it
tough
as
it
was
in
the
process
he
is
making
good
up
there
he
will
make
good
over
seas
he
is
a
born
leader
a
better
leader
of
men
than
his
brother
would
be
though
maybe
larry
is
finer
stuff
i
do
know
they
are
very
different
but
i
like
to
think
they
are
both
rather
fine
stuff
maybe
that
is
my
partial
view
but
i
am
a
bit
proud
of
them
both
ted
as
well
as
larry
you
have
every
reason
approved
the
captain
heartily
i
have
seen
a
good
many
splendid
lads
in
the
last
four
years
and
these
two
measure
up
in
a
way
which
is
an
eye
opener
to
me
in
my
stupid
insular
prejudice
maybe
i
had
fallen
to
thinking
that
the
particular
quality
that
marks
them
both
was
a
distinctly
british
affair
apparently
you
can
breed
it
in
america
too
i
glad
to
see
it
and
to
own
it
and
may
i
say
one
other
thing
doctor
holiday
i
have
the
and
a
lot
of
other
junk
like
that
but
i
surrender
every
bit
of
it
this
minute
gladly
if
i
thought
that
i
would
ever
have
a
son
that
would
worship
me
the
way
those
lads
of
yours
worship
you
it
is
an
honor
any
man
might
well
covet

alan
massey
loses
himself
while
ruth
and
larry
steered
their
storm
tossed
craft
of
love
into
smooth
haven
at
last
while
ted
came
into
his
own
in
the
canadian
training
camp
and
tony
played
broadway
to
her
heart
content
the
two
masseys
down
in
mexico
drifted
into
a
strange
pact
of
friendship
had
there
been
no
other
ministrations
offered
save
those
of
creature
comfort
alone
dick
would
have
had
cause
to
be
immensely
grateful
to
alan
massey
to
good
food
good
nursing
and
material
comfort
the
young
man
reacted
quickly
for
he
was
a
healthy
young
animal
and
had
no
bad
habits
to
militate
against
recovery
but
there
was
more
than
creature
comfort
in
alan
service
without
the
latter
presence
loneliness
homesickness
and
heartache
would
have
gnawed
at
the
younger
man
retarding
his
physical
gains
with
alan
massey
life
even
on
a
sick
bed
took
on
fascinating
colors
like
a
prism
in
sunlight
for
the
sick
lad
delectation
alan
spun
long
thrilling
tales
many
of
them
based
on
personal
experience
in
his
wide
travels
in
many
lands
he
was
a
magnificent
raconteur
and
dick
propped
up
among
his
pillows
drank
it
all
in
listening
like
another
desdemona
to
strange
moving
accidents
of
fire
and
flood
which
his
scribbling
soul
recognized
as
superb
copy
often
too
alan
read
from
books
called
in
the
masters
of
the
pen
to
set
the
listener
eager
mind
atravel
through
wondrous
unexplored
worlds
best
of
all
perhaps
were
the
twilight
hours
when
alan
quoted
long
passages
of
poetry
from
memory
lending
to
the
magic
of
the
poet
art
his
own
magic
of
voice
and
intonation
these
were
wonderful
moments
to
dick
moments
he
was
never
to
forget
he
drank
deep
of
the
soul
vintage
which
the
other
man
offered
him
out
of
the
abundance
of
his
experience
as
a
life
long
pilgrim
in
the
service
of
beauty
it
was
a
curious
relation
this
growing
friendship
between
the
two
men
in
some
respects
they
were
as
master
and
pupil
in
others
were
as
man
and
man
friend
and
friend
almost
brother
and
brother
when
alan
massey
gave
at
all
he
gave
magnificently
without
stint
or
reservation
he
did
now
and
when
he
willed
to
conquer
he
seldom
if
ever
failed
he
did
not
now
he
won
won
first
his
cousin
liking
respect
and
gratitude
and
finally
his
loyal
friendship
and
something
else
that
was
akin
to
reverence
tony
holiday
name
was
seldom
mentioned
between
the
two
perhaps
they
feared
that
with
the
name
of
the
girl
they
both
loved
there
might
return
also
the
old
antagonistic
forces
which
had
already
wrought
too
much
havoc
both
sincerely
desired
peace
and
amity
and
therefore
the
woman
who
held
both
their
hearts
in
her
keeping
was
almost
banished
from
the
talk
of
the
sick
room
though
she
was
far
from
forgotten
by
either
so
things
went
on
in
time
dick
was
judged
by
the
physician
well
enough
to
take
the
long
journey
back
to
new
york
alan
secured
the
tickets
made
all
the
arrangements
permitting
dick
not
so
much
as
the
lifting
of
a
finger
in
his
own
behalf
and
just
then
came
tony
holiday
letter
to
alan
telling
him
she
was
his
whenever
he
wanted
her
since
he
had
cleared
the
shield
forever
in
her
eyes
by
what
he
had
done
for
dick
she
trusted
him
knew
he
would
not
ask
her
to
marry
him
unless
he
was
quite
free
morally
and
every
other
way
to
ask
her
she
wanted
him
could
not
be
surer
of
his
love
or
her
own
if
she
waited
a
dozen
years
he
meant
more
to
her
than
her
work
more
than
her
beloved
freedom
more
even
than
holiday
hill
itself
although
she
felt
that
she
was
not
so
much
deserting
the
hill
as
bringing
alan
to
it
the
others
would
learn
to
love
him
too
they
must
because
she
loved
him
so
much
but
even
if
they
did
not
she
had
made
her
choice
she
belonged
to
him
first
of
all
but
think
dear
she
finished
think
well
before
you
take
me
come
to
me
at
all
unless
you
can
come
free
with
nothing
on
your
soul
that
is
going
to
prevent
your
being
happy
with
me
i
shall
ask
no
questions
if
you
come
i
trust
you
to
decide
right
for
us
both
because
you
lave
me
in
the
high
way
as
well
as
all
the
other
ways
alan
took
this
letter
of
tony
out
into
the
night
walked
with
it
through
flaming
valleys
of
hell
she
was
his
of
her
own
free
will
she
had
given
herself
to
him
placed
him
higher
in
her
heart
at
last
than
even
her
sacred
hill
and
yet
after
all
the
hill
stood
between
them
in
the
challenge
she
flung
at
him
she
was
his
to
take
if
he
could
come
free
she
left
the
decision
to
him
she
trusted
him
good
god
why
should
he
hesitate
to
take
what
she
was
willing
to
give
he
had
atoned
saved
his
cousin
life
lived
decently
honorably
as
he
had
promised
kept
faith
with
tony
herself
when
he
might
perhaps
have
won
her
on
baser
terms
than
he
had
made
himself
keep
to
because
he
loved
her
as
she
said
in
the
high
way
as
well
as
all
the
other
ways
he
would
contrive
some
way
of
giving
his
cousin
back
the
money
he
did
not
want
it
he
only
wanted
tony
and
her
love
why
in
the
name
of
all
the
devils
should
he
who
had
sinned
all
his
life
head
up
and
eyes
open
balk
at
this
one
sin
the
negative
sin
of
mere
silence
when
it
would
give
him
what
he
wanted
more
than
all
the
world
what
was
he
afraid
of
the
answer
he
would
not
let
himself
discover
he
was
afraid
of
tony
holiday
clear
eyes
but
he
was
more
afraid
of
something
else
his
own
soul
which
somehow
tony
had
created
by
loving
and
believing
in
him
all
the
next
day
the
day
before
they
were
to
leave
on
the
northern
journey
alan
behaved
as
if
all
the
devils
of
hell
which
he
had
invoked
were
with
him
the
old
mocking
bitterness
of
tongue
was
back
an
even
more
savage
light
than
dick
remembered
that
night
of
their
quarrel
was
in
his
green
eyes
the
man
was
suddenly
acidulated
as
if
he
had
over
night
suffered
a
chemical
transformation
which
had
affected
both
mind
and
body
a
wild
beast
tortured
evil
ready
to
pounce
looked
out
of
his
drawn
white
face
dick
wondered
greatly
what
had
caused
the
strange
reaction
and
seeing
the
other
was
suffering
tremendously
for
some
reason
or
other
unexplained
and
perhaps
inexplicable
was
profoundly
sorry
his
friendship
for
the
man
who
had
saved
his
life
was
altogether
too
strong
and
deep
to
be
shaken
by
this
temporary
lapse
into
brutality
which
he
had
known
all
along
was
there
although
held
miraculously
in
abeyance
these
many
weeks
the
man
was
a
genius
with
all
the
temperamental
fluctuations
of
mood
which
are
comprehensible
and
forgivable
in
a
genius
dick
did
not
begrudge
the
other
any
relief
he
might
find
in
his
debauch
of
ill
humor
was
more
than
willing
he
should
work
it
off
on
his
humble
self
if
it
could
do
any
good
though
he
would
be
immensely
relieved
when
the
old
friendly
alan
came
back
twilight
descended
dick
turned
from
the
mirror
after
a
critical
survey
of
his
own
lean
fever
parched
yellow
countenance
lord
i
look
like
a
peanut
he
commenced
disgustedly
i
say
massey
when
we
get
back
to
new
york
i
think
i
should
choke
anybody
if
i
were
you
who
dared
to
say
we
looked
alike
one
must
draw
the
line
somewhere
at
what
constitutes
a
permissible
insult
he
grinned
whimsically
at
his
own
expense
turned
back
to
the
mirror
upon
my
word
though
i
believe
it
is
true
we
do
look
alike
i
never
saw
it
until
this
minute
funny
things
resemblances
this
is
so
funny
drawled
alan
we
had
the
same
great
grandfather
dick
whirled
about
staring
at
the
other
man
as
if
he
thought
him
suddenly
gone
mad
what
what
do
you
know
about
my
great
grandfather
do
you
know
who
i
am
i
do
you
are
john
massey
old
john
grandson
the
chap
i
told
you
once
was
dead
and
decently
buried
i
hoped
it
was
true
at
the
time
but
it
was
a
week
before
i
knew
it
was
a
lie
i
found
out
john
massey
was
alive
and
that
he
was
going
under
the
name
of
dick
carson
do
you
wonder
i
hated
you
dick
sat
down
his
face
white
he
looked
and
was
utterly
dazed
i
do
understand
he
said
do
you
mind
explaining
it
it
is
a
little
hard
to
get
all
at
once
and
then
alan
massey
told
the
story
that
no
living
being
save
himself
knew
he
spared
himself
nothing
apologised
for
nothing
expressed
no
regret
asked
for
no
palliation
of
judgment
forgiveness
or
even
understanding
quietly
apparently
without
emotion
he
gave
back
to
the
other
man
the
birthright
he
had
robbed
him
of
by
his
selfish
and
dishonorable
connivance
with
a
wicked
old
man
now
beyond
the
power
of
any
vengeance
or
penalty
dick
carson
was
no
longer
nameless
but
as
he
listened
tensely
to
his
cousin
revelations
he
almost
found
it
in
his
heart
to
wish
he
were
it
was
too
terrible
to
have
won
his
name
at
such
a
cost
as
he
listened
watching
alan
eyes
burn
in
the
dusk
in
strange
contrast
to
his
cool
liquid
studiously
tranquil
voice
dick
remembered
a
line
alan
himself
had
read
him
only
the
other
day
hell
the
shadow
of
a
soul
on
fire
the
persian
phrased
it
watching
dick
carson
saw
before
him
a
sadder
thing
a
soul
which
had
once
been
on
fire
and
was
now
but
gray
ashes
the
flame
had
blazed
up
scorched
and
blackened
its
path
it
was
over
now
burnt
out
at
alan
massey
was
through
had
lived
his
life
had
given
up
the
younger
man
saw
this
with
a
pang
which
had
no
reactive
thought
of
self
only
compassion
for
the
other
that
is
all
i
think
said
alan
at
last
i
have
all
the
proofs
of
your
identity
with
me
i
never
could
destroy
them
somehow
though
i
have
meant
to
over
and
over
again
on
the
same
principle
i
suppose
that
the
sinning
monk
sears
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
breast
though
he
makes
no
outward
confession
to
the
world
and
means
to
make
none
i
never
meant
to
make
mine
i
do
know
why
i
am
doing
it
now
or
rather
i
do
i
marry
tony
with
this
thing
between
us
i
tried
to
think
i
could
that
made
up
to
you
by
saving
your
life
that
i
was
free
to
take
my
happiness
with
her
because
i
loved
her
and
she
loved
me
and
she
does
love
me
she
wrote
me
yesterday
she
would
marry
me
whenever
i
wished
i
could
have
had
her
but
i
could
take
her
that
way
i
could
have
made
her
happy
she
would
have
read
the
thing
in
my
soul
she
is
too
clean
and
honest
and
true
herself
not
to
feel
the
presence
of
the
other
thing
when
it
came
near
her
i
have
tried
to
tell
myself
love
was
enough
that
it
would
make
up
to
her
for
the
rest
it
is
enough
you
ca
build
life
or
happiness
except
on
the
quarry
stuff
they
keep
on
holiday
hill
right
honor
decency
you
know
that
tony
forgave
my
past
i
believe
she
is
generous
enough
to
forgive
even
this
and
go
on
with
me
but
i
sha
ask
her
i
wo
let
her
i
i
given
her
up
with
the
rest
the
speaker
came
over
to
where
dick
sat
silent
stunned
enough
of
that
i
have
no
wish
to
appeal
to
you
in
any
way
the
next
move
is
yours
you
can
act
as
you
please
you
can
brand
me
as
a
criminal
if
you
choose
it
is
what
i
am
guilty
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
as
well
as
in
my
own
eyes
and
yours
i
am
not
pleading
innocence
i
am
pleading
unqualified
guilt
understand
that
clearly
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
when
i
did
it
i
have
known
ever
since
i
never
been
blind
to
the
rottenness
of
the
thing
at
first
i
did
it
for
the
money
because
i
was
afraid
of
poverty
and
honest
work
and
then
i
went
on
with
it
for
tony
because
i
loved
her
and
would
give
her
up
to
you
now
given
up
the
last
ditch
the
name
is
yours
and
the
money
is
yours
and
if
you
can
win
tony
she
is
yours
i
out
of
the
face
for
good
and
all
but
we
have
to
settle
just
how
the
thing
is
going
to
be
done
and
that
is
for
you
to
say
i
wish
i
need
do
anything
about
it
said
dick
slowly
after
a
moment
i
do
want
the
money
i
am
almost
afraid
of
it
it
seems
accursed
somehow
considering
what
it
did
to
you
even
the
name
i
do
seem
to
care
so
much
about
just
now
thought
i
have
wanted
a
name
as
i
have
never
wanted
anything
else
in
the
world
except
tony
it
was
mostly
for
her
i
wanted
it
see
here
alan
why
ca
we
make
a
compromise
you
say
roberts
wrote
two
letters
and
you
have
both
why
ca
we
destroy
the
one
and
send
the
other
to
the
lawyers
the
one
that
lets
you
out
it
is
nobody
business
but
ours
we
can
say
that
the
letter
has
just
fallen
into
your
hands
with
the
other
proof
that
i
am
the
john
massey
that
was
stolen
that
would
straighten
the
thing
out
for
you
i
no
desire
to
brand
you
in
any
way
why
should
i
after
all
i
owe
you
you
have
made
up
a
million
times
by
saving
my
life
and
by
the
way
you
have
given
the
thing
over
now
anyway
one
does
exact
payment
from
one
friends
and
you
are
my
friend
alan
you
offered
me
friendship
i
took
it
was
proud
to
take
it
i
am
proud
now
prouder
than
ever
and
rising
dick
carson
who
was
no
longer
dick
carson
but
john
massey
held
out
his
hand
to
the
man
who
had
wronged
him
so
bitterly
the
paraquet
in
the
corner
jibbered
harshly
thunder
rumbled
heavily
outside
an
eerily
vivid
flash
of
lightning
dispelled
for
a
moment
the
gloom
of
the
dusk
as
the
two
men
clasped
hands
john
massey
alan
voice
with
its
deep
cello
quality
was
vibrant
with
emotion
you
do
know
what
that
means
to
me
men
have
called
me
many
things
but
few
have
ever
called
me
friend
except
in
lip
service
for
what
they
thought
they
could
get
out
of
it
and
from
you
well
i
can
only
say
i
thank
you
we
are
the
only
masseys
we
ought
to
stand
together
said
dick
simply
alan
smiled
though
the
room
was
too
dark
for
dick
to
see
we
ca
stand
together
i
have
forfeited
the
right
you
chose
the
high
road
long
ago
and
i
chose
the
other
we
have
both
to
abide
by
our
choices
we
ca
change
those
things
at
will
spare
me
the
public
revelation
if
you
care
to
i
shall
be
glad
for
tony
sake
for
myself
it
does
matter
much
i
do
expect
to
cross
your
path
or
hers
again
i
am
going
to
lose
myself
maybe
some
day
you
will
win
her
she
will
be
worth
the
winning
but
do
hurry
her
if
you
want
to
win
she
will
have
to
get
over
me
first
and
that
will
take
time
she
will
never
get
over
you
alan
i
know
her
things
go
deep
with
her
they
do
with
all
the
holidays
you
sha
lose
yourself
there
is
no
need
of
it
tony
loves
you
you
must
stay
and
make
her
happy
you
can
now
you
are
free
she
need
never
know
the
worst
of
this
any
more
than
the
rest
of
the
world
need
know
we
can
divide
the
money
it
is
the
only
way
i
am
willing
to
have
any
of
it
alan
shook
his
head
we
can
divide
nothing
not
the
money
and
not
tony
love
i
told
you
i
was
giving
it
all
up
you
can
not
stop
me
no
man
has
ever
stopped
me
from
doing
what
i
willed
to
do
i
have
a
letter
or
two
to
write
now
and
so
i
leave
you
i
am
glad
you
do
hate
me
john
massey
shall
we
shake
hands
once
more
and
then
their
hands
met
again
a
sharp
glare
of
lightning
lit
the
room
with
ominous
brilliancy
for
a
moment
the
paraquet
screamed
raucously
and
then
the
door
closed
on
alan
massey
an
hour
later
a
servant
brought
word
to
dick
that
an
american
was
below
waiting
to
speak
to
him
he
descended
with
the
card
in
his
hand
the
name
was
unfamiliar
arthur
hallock
of
chicago
mining
engineer
the
stranger
stood
in
the
hall
waiting
while
dick
came
down
the
stairs
he
was
obviously
ill
at
ease
i
am
hallock
announced
the
visitor
you
are
richard
carson
dick
nodded
already
the
name
was
beginning
to
sound
strange
on
his
ears
in
one
hour
he
had
gotten
oddly
accustomed
to
knowing
that
he
was
john
massey
and
no
longer
needed
tony
name
dear
as
it
was
i
am
sorry
to
be
the
bearer
of
ill
news
carson
the
stranger
proceeded
you
have
a
friend
named
alan
massey
living
here
with
you
again
dick
nodded
he
was
apprehensive
at
the
mention
of
alan
name
there
was
a
riot
down
there
the
speaker
pointed
down
the
street
a
fuss
over
an
american
flag
some
dirty
german
dog
had
spit
at
it
take
long
to
start
a
life
sized
row
we
are
all
spoiling
for
a
chance
to
stick
a
few
of
the
pigs
ourselves
whether
we
technically
at
war
or
not
a
lot
of
us
collected
your
friend
massey
among
the
rest
i
remember
particularly
when
he
joined
the
mob
because
he
was
so
much
taller
than
the
rest
of
us
and
came
strolling
in
as
if
he
was
going
to
an
afternoon
tea
instead
of
getting
into
an
international
mess
with
nearly
all
the
contracting
parties
drunk
and
disorderly
there
was
a
good
deal
of
excitement
and
confusion
i
do
believe
anybody
knows
just
what
happened
but
a
drunken
mexican
drew
a
dagger
somewhere
in
the
mix
up
and
let
it
fly
indiscriminate
like
we
all
scattered
like
mischief
when
we
saw
the
thing
flash
nobody
cares
much
for
that
kind
of
plaything
at
close
range
but
massey
did
move
it
got
him
clean
in
the
heart
he
could
have
suffered
a
second
it
was
all
over
in
a
breath
he
fell
and
the
mob
made
itself
scarce
another
fellow
and
i
were
the
first
to
get
to
him
but
there
was
anything
to
do
but
look
in
his
pockets
and
find
out
who
he
was
we
found
his
name
on
a
card
with
this
address
and
your
name
scribbled
on
it
in
pencil
i
say
carson
i
am
horribly
sorry
suddenly
perceiving
dick
white
face
you
care
a
lot
do
you
i
care
a
lot
said
dick
woodenly
he
was
my
cousin
and
my
best
friend
i
am
sorry
repeated
the
young
engineer
carson
there
is
something
else
i
feel
as
if
i
had
to
say
though
i
sha
say
it
to
any
one
else
massey
might
have
dodged
with
the
rest
of
us
he
saw
it
coming
just
as
we
did
he
waited
for
it
and
i
saw
him
smile
as
it
came
a
queer
smile
at
that
maybe
i
mistaken
but
i
have
a
hunch
he
wanted
that
dagger
to
find
him
that
was
why
he
smiled
i
think
you
are
entirely
right
hallock
said
dick
i
have
any
doubt
but
that
was
why
he
smiled
he
would
smile
just
that
way
where
where
is
he
dick
brushed
his
hands
across
his
eyes
as
he
asked
the
question
he
had
never
felt
so
desolate
so
utterly
alone
in
his
life
they
are
bringing
him
here
shall
i
stay
can
i
help
anyway
dick
shook
his
head
sadly
thank
you
i
do
think
there
is
anything
any
one
can
do
i
i
wish
there
was
a
little
later
alan
massey
dead
body
lay
in
austere
dignity
in
the
house
in
which
he
had
saved
his
cousin
life
and
given
him
back
his
name
and
fortune
together
with
the
right
to
win
the
girl
he
himself
had
loved
so
well
the
smile
was
still
on
his
face
and
a
strange
serenity
of
expression
was
there
too
he
slept
well
at
last
he
had
lost
himself
as
he
had
proclaimed
his
intent
to
do
and
in
losing
had
found
himself
one
could
not
look
upon
that
calm
white
sculptured
face
without
feeling
that
alan
massey
had
died
a
victor
undaunted
a
master
of
fate

the
end
chapter
xxxviii
the
song
in
the
night
tony
holiday
sat
in
the
dressing
room
waiting
her
cue
to
go
on
the
stage
it
was
only
a
rehearsal
however
miss
clay
was
back
now
and
tony
was
once
more
the
humble
understudy
though
with
a
heart
full
of
happy
knowledge
of
what
it
is
like
to
be
a
real
actress
with
a
doting
public
at
her
feet
while
she
waited
she
picked
up
a
newspaper
and
carelessly
scanned
its
pages
suddenly
to
the
amazement
and
consternation
of
the
other
girl
who
was
dressing
in
the
same
room
she
uttered
a
sharp
little
cry
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
healthy
young
life
slid
to
the
floor
in
a
merciful
faint
her
frightened
companion
called
for
help
instantly
and
it
was
only
a
moment
before
tony
brown
eyes
opened
and
she
pulled
herself
up
from
the
couch
where
they
had
laid
her
but
she
would
not
speak
or
tell
them
what
had
happened
and
it
was
only
when
they
had
gotten
her
off
in
a
cab
with
a
motherly
big
hearted
woman
who
played
shrew
and
parts
always
on
the
stage
but
was
the
one
person
of
the
whole
cast
to
whom
every
one
turned
in
time
of
trouble
that
the
rest
searched
the
paper
for
the
clew
to
the
thing
which
had
made
tony
look
like
death
itself
it
was
not
far
to
seek
tony
looked
like
death
because
alan
massey
was
dead
they
all
knew
alan
massey
and
knew
that
he
and
tony
holiday
were
intimate
friends
perhaps
even
betrothed
more
than
one
of
them
had
seen
and
remembered
how
he
had
kissed
her
before
them
all
on
the
night
of
first
broadway
triumph
and
some
of
them
had
wondered
why
he
had
not
been
seen
since
with
her
so
he
had
been
in
mexico
and
now
he
was
dead
his
heart
pierced
by
a
mexican
dagger
and
tony
tony
of
the
gay
tongue
and
the
quick
laughter
had
the
dagger
gone
into
her
heart
too
it
looked
so
the
end
of
the
rainbow
cast
felt
very
sad
and
sober
that
day
they
loved
tony
and
just
now
she
was
not
an
actress
to
them
but
a
girl
who
had
loved
a
man
a
man
who
was
dead
jean
lambert
telegraphed
at
once
for
doctor
holiday
to
come
to
tony
who
was
in
a
bad
way
she
would
talk
she
would
eat
she
did
not
sleep
she
did
not
cry
jean
thought
if
she
cried
her
grief
would
not
have
been
so
pitiful
to
behold
it
was
the
stony
white
silence
of
her
that
was
intolerable
to
witness
in
her
uncle
arms
tony
terrible
calm
gave
way
and
she
sobbed
herself
to
utter
weariness
and
finally
to
sleep
but
even
to
him
she
would
not
talk
much
about
alan
he
had
not
known
alan
he
had
never
understood
never
would
understand
now
how
wonderful
how
lovable
how
splendid
her
lover
had
been
for
several
days
she
was
kept
in
bed
and
the
doctor
hardly
left
her
it
was
a
hard
time
for
him
as
well
as
his
stricken
niece
even
their
love
for
each
other
did
not
serve
to
lighten
the
pain
to
any
great
extent
it
was
not
the
same
sorrow
they
had
doctor
holiday
was
suffering
because
his
little
girl
suffered
tony
was
suffering
because
she
loved
alan
massey
who
would
never
come
to
her
again
neither
could
entirely
share
the
grief
of
the
other
alan
massey
was
between
them
still
finally
dick
came
and
was
able
to
give
what
doctor
philip
could
not
he
could
sing
alan
praises
tell
her
how
wonderful
he
had
been
how
generous
and
kind
he
could
share
her
grief
as
no
one
else
could
because
he
had
learned
to
love
alan
massey
almost
as
well
as
she
did
herself
dick
talked
freely
of
alan
told
her
of
the
strange
discovery
which
they
had
made
that
he
and
alan
were
cousins
and
that
he
himself
was
john
massey
the
kidnapped
baby
whom
he
had
been
so
sorry
for
when
he
had
looked
up
the
massey
story
at
the
time
of
the
old
man
death
dick
was
not
an
apt
liar
but
he
lied
gallantly
now
for
alan
sake
and
for
tony
he
told
her
that
it
was
only
since
alan
had
been
in
mexico
that
he
had
known
who
his
cousin
was
and
had
immediately
possessed
the
other
of
the
facts
and
turned
over
to
him
the
proofs
of
his
identity
as
john
massey
it
was
a
good
lie
well
conceived
and
well
delivered
but
the
liar
had
not
reckoned
on
that
fatal
holiday
gift
of
intuition
tony
listened
to
the
story
shut
her
eyes
and
thought
hard
for
a
moment
then
she
opened
her
eyes
again
and
looked
straight
at
dick
that
is
not
the
truth
she
said
alan
knew
before
he
went
to
mexico
he
knew
long
before
that
was
the
other
ghost
the
one
he
could
not
lay
do
lie
to
me
i
know
and
then
yielding
to
her
command
dick
began
again
and
told
her
the
truth
serving
alan
memory
well
by
the
relation
one
thing
only
he
kept
back
after
all
he
had
no
proof
that
the
young
engineer
had
been
right
in
his
conjecture
that
alan
had
wanted
the
dagger
to
find
him
there
was
no
need
of
hurting
tony
with
that
dick
i
ca
call
you
john
yet
i
ca
even
think
about
you
though
i
am
so
thankful
to
have
you
back
safe
and
well
i
ca
be
glad
yet
for
you
i
ca
remember
any
one
but
alan
you
will
forgive
me
i
know
but
tell
me
it
was
a
terrible
thing
he
did
to
you
do
you
forgive
him
really
the
girl
deep
shadowed
eyes
searched
the
young
man
face
challenging
him
to
speak
the
truth
and
only
that
he
met
the
challenge
willingly
he
had
nothing
to
conceal
here
tony
might
read
him
through
and
through
and
she
would
find
in
him
neither
hate
nor
rancor
nor
condemnation
of
course
i
forgive
him
tony
he
did
a
terrible
thing
to
me
you
say
he
did
a
much
more
terrible
thing
to
himself
and
he
made
up
for
everything
over
and
over
by
what
he
did
for
me
in
mexico
he
might
have
let
me
die
i
should
have
died
if
he
had
not
come
there
is
no
doubt
in
the
world
of
that
he
could
not
have
done
more
if
he
had
been
my
own
brother
he
meant
me
to
like
him
he
did
more
he
made
me
love
him
he
was
my
friend
we
parted
as
friends
with
a
handshake
which
was
his
though
i
did
know
it
it
was
a
fatal
speech
too
late
dick
realized
it
as
he
saw
tony
face
dick
he
meant
to
let
himself
get
killed
i
thought
so
all
along
and
now
i
know
you
think
so
too
i
did
mean
to
let
that
out
maybe
i
am
mistaken
we
shall
never
know
but
i
believe
he
was
not
sorry
to
let
the
dagger
get
him
he
had
given
up
everything
else
it
was
so
hard
for
him
to
give
up
the
one
thing
more
the
thing
he
did
want
anyway
life
life
was
much
to
him
after
he
gave
you
up
tony
his
love
was
the
biggest
thing
about
him
i
love
you
myself
but
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
his
love
was
a
bigger
thing
than
mine
every
way
finer
more
magnificent
the
love
of
a
genius
whereas
mine
is
just
the
love
of
an
every
day
man
it
was
love
that
saved
him
dick
do
you
believe
that
the
real
alan
is
dust
nothing
but
dust
down
in
a
grave
demanded
tony
suddenly
no
tony
i
do
i
ca
the
essence
of
what
was
best
in
him
is
alive
somewhere
i
know
it
it
must
be
his
love
for
you
for
all
beauty
they
could
die
dear
they
were
big
enough
to
be
immortal
and
his
dancing
sighed
tony
his
dancing
could
die
it
had
a
soul
if
she
had
not
been
sure
already
that
alan
had
meant
to
go
out
of
her
life
even
if
he
had
not
meant
to
go
to
his
death
when
he
left
new
york
she
would
have
been
convinced
a
little
later
alan
japanese
servant
brought
two
gifts
to
her
from
his
honorable
master
according
to
his
honorable
master
orders
should
he
not
return
from
his
journey
his
honorable
master
being
unfortunately
dead
his
unworthy
servant
laid
the
gifts
at
mees
holiday
honorable
feet
whereupon
the
bearer
had
departed
as
quietly
as
death
itself
might
come
one
of
the
gifts
was
a
picture
a
painting
which
tony
had
seen
and
which
was
she
thought
the
most
beautiful
of
all
his
beautiful
creations
its
sheer
loveliness
would
have
hurt
her
even
if
it
had
had
no
other
significance
and
it
did
have
a
very
real
message
at
first
sight
the
whole
scene
seemed
enveloped
in
translucent
silver
mist
as
one
looked
more
closely
however
there
was
revealed
the
figure
of
a
man
black
clad
in
pilgrim
guise
kneeling
on
the
verge
of
a
precipitous
cliff
which
rose
out
of
a
seemingly
bottomless
abyss
of
terrific
blackness
though
in
posture
of
prayer
the
pilgrim
head
was
lifted
and
his
face
wore
an
expression
of
rapt
adoration
above
a
film
of
fog
in
the
heavens
stretched
a
clear
space
of
deep
blue
black
sky
in
which
hung
a
single
luminous
star
from
the
star
a
line
of
golden
light
of
unearthly
radiance
descended
and
finding
its
way
to
the
uplifted
transfigured
face
of
the
kneeling
pilgrim
ended
there
tony
holiday
understood
got
the
message
as
clearly
as
if
alan
himself
stood
beside
her
to
interpret
it
she
knew
that
he
was
telling
her
through
the
picture
that
she
had
saved
his
soul
kept
him
out
of
the
abyss
that
to
the
end
she
was
what
he
had
so
often
called
her
his
star
with
tear
blinded
eyes
she
turned
from
the
canvas
to
the
little
silver
box
which
the
servant
had
placed
in
her
hands
together
with
a
sealed
envelope
in
the
box
was
a
gorgeous
unset
ruby
the
gem
of
collection
as
tony
well
knew
having
worshiped
often
at
its
shrine
it
lay
there
now
against
the
austere
purity
of
its
white
satin
background
the
symbol
of
imperishable
passion
reverently
tony
closed
the
little
box
and
opened
the
sealed
envelope
dreading
yet
longing
to
know
its
contents
alan
had
sent
her
no
word
of
farewell
had
not
written
to
her
that
night
before
he
went
out
into
the
storm
to
meet
his
death
had
made
no
response
to
the
letter
she
herself
had
written
offering
herself
and
her
love
and
faith
for
his
taking
at
first
these
things
had
hurt
her
but
these
gifts
of
his
were
beginning
to
make
her
understand
his
silence
selfish
and
spectacular
all
his
life
at
his
death
alan
massey
had
been
surpassingly
generous
and
simple
he
had
chosen
to
bequeath
his
love
to
her
not
as
an
obsession
and
a
bondage
but
as
an
elemental
thing
like
light
and
air
the
message
in
the
envelope
was
in
its
way
as
impersonal
as
the
ruby
had
been
but
tony
found
it
more
hauntingly
personal
than
she
had
ever
found
his
most
impassioned
love
letter
once
more
the
words
were
couched
in
the
symbol
tongue
of
the
poet
in
india
in
only
two
sentences
but
sentences
so
poignant
that
they
stamped
themselves
forever
on
tony
holiday
mind
as
they
stood
out
from
the
paper
in
alan
beautiful
striking
handwriting
when
the
lighted
lamp
is
brought
into
the
room
i
shall
go
and
then
perhaps
you
will
listen
to
the
night
and
hear
my
song
when
i
am
silent
the
lines
were
dated
on
that
unforgettable
night
when
tony
had
played
broadway
and
danced
her
last
dance
with
her
royal
lover
so
he
had
known
even
then
that
he
was
giving
her
up
realizing
this
tony
realized
as
she
never
had
before
the
high
quality
of
his
love
she
could
guess
a
little
of
what
that
night
had
meant
to
him
how
passionately
he
must
have
desired
to
win
through
to
the
full
fruition
of
his
love
before
he
gave
her
up
for
all
the
rest
of
time
and
she
herself
had
been
mad
that
night
tony
remembered
ah
well
he
had
been
strong
for
them
both
and
now
their
love
would
always
stay
upon
the
high
levels
never
descend
to
the
ways
of
earth
there
would
never
be
anything
to
regret
though
tony
loving
her
lover
memory
as
she
did
that
moment
was
not
so
sure
but
she
regretted
that
most
of
all
yet
tragic
as
alan
death
was
and
bitterly
and
sincerely
as
she
mourned
his
loss
tony
could
see
that
he
had
after
all
chosen
the
happiest
way
out
for
himself
as
well
as
for
her
and
his
cousin
it
was
not
hard
to
forgive
a
dead
lover
with
a
generous
act
of
renunciation
his
last
deed
it
would
have
been
far
less
easy
to
forgive
a
living
lover
with
such
a
stain
upon
his
life
even
though
he
tried
to
wash
it
away
by
his
surrender
and
she
by
her
forgiveness
the
stain
would
have
remained
ineradicable
there
would
always
have
been
a
barrier
between
them
for
all
his
effort
and
her
own
and
his
love
would
ill
have
borne
denial
or
frustration
without
her
he
would
have
gone
down
into
dark
pits
if
he
had
gone
on
living
perhaps
he
had
known
and
feared
this
himself
willing
to
prevent
it
at
any
cost
perhaps
he
had
known
that
so
long
as
he
lived
she
tony
would
never
have
been
entirely
her
own
again
his
bondage
would
have
been
upon
her
even
if
he
never
saw
her
again
perhaps
he
had
elected
death
most
of
all
for
this
reason
had
loved
her
well
enough
to
set
her
free
he
had
told
her
once
that
love
was
twofold
a
force
of
destruction
and
damnation
but
also
a
force
of
purification
and
salvation
alan
had
loved
her
greatly
perhaps
in
the
end
his
love
had
taken
him
in
his
own
words
to
the
gate
of
heaven
tony
did
not
know
but
she
thought
if
there
really
was
a
god
he
would
understand
and
forgive
the
soul
of
alan
massey
for
that
last
splendid
sacrifice
of
his
in
the
name
of
love
and
whatever
happened
tony
holiday
knew
that
she
would
bear
forever
the
mark
of
alan
massey
stormy
strange
and
in
the
end
love
perhaps
some
day
the
lighted
lamp
might
be
brought
in
she
did
not
know
would
not
attempt
to
prophesy
about
that
she
did
not
know
that
she
would
always
listen
to
the
night
for
alan
massey
sake
and
hear
his
song
though
he
was
silent
forever
the
next
day
richard
carson
officially
disappeared
from
the
world
and
john
massey
appeared
in
his
place
the
papers
made
rather
a
striking
story
of
his
romantic
history
and
its
startling
denouement
which
had
come
they
said
through
the
death
bed
confessions
of
the
man
roberts
which
had
only
just
reached
the
older
massey
hands
strangely
enough
on
the
eve
of
his
own
tragic
death
which
was
again
related
to
make
the
tale
a
little
more
of
a
thriller
that
was
all
the
world
knew
was
ever
to
know
for
the
holidays
and
john
massey
kept
the
dead
man
secret
well
and
the
grass
grew
green
on
alan
massey
grave
the
sun
and
dew
and
rain
laid
tender
fingers
upon
it
and
great
crimson
and
gold
hearted
roses
strewed
their
fragrant
petals
upon
it
year
by
year
the
stars
he
had
loved
so
well
shone
down
upon
the
lonely
spot
where
his
body
slept
quiet
at
last
after
the
torment
of
his
brief
and
stormy
life
but
otherwise
as
john
massey
and
tony
holiday
believed
his
undefeated
spirit
fared
on
splendidly
in
its
divine
quest
of
beauty
chapter
xxxix
in
which
the
tale
ends
in
the
house
on
the
hill
the
winter
had
at
last
decided
to
recapture
its
forsaken
role
of
the
snow
king
for
two
days
and
as
many
nights
the
air
had
been
one
swirl
of
snow
which
shut
out
earth
and
sky
but
on
the
third
morning
the
hill
woke
to
a
dazzling
world
of
cloudless
blue
and
trackless
white
a
resplendent
day
it
was
and
fitly
so
for
before
sundown
the
old
house
on
the
hill
was
to
know
another
bride
elinor
ruth
farringdon
affairs
required
her
immediate
attention
in
australia
and
she
was
leaving
for
that
far
away
island
which
was
again
now
dear
to
her
heart
as
the
home
of
her
happy
childhood
the
memory
of
which
had
now
all
returned
after
months
of
strange
obliteration
but
she
would
not
go
as
elinor
ruth
farringdon
that
name
was
to
be
shed
as
absolutely
as
her
recollection
of
it
had
once
been
shed
she
would
go
as
laurence
holiday
with
a
real
wedding
ring
all
her
own
and
a
real
husband
also
all
her
own
by
her
side
there
were
to
be
no
guests
outside
the
family
except
for
the
lamberts
carlotta
and
dick
john
massey
as
they
were
now
trying
to
learn
to
call
him
the
wedding
was
to
be
very
quiet
not
only
because
of
granny
but
because
they
were
all
very
pitiful
of
tony
still
fresh
grief
the
more
so
because
she
bore
it
so
bravely
and
quietly
anxious
lest
she
cast
any
shadow
upon
the
happiness
of
the
others
especially
that
of
larry
and
ruth
in
any
case
a
quiet
wedding
would
have
been
the
choice
of
the
two
who
were
most
concerned
they
wanted
only
their
near
and
dear
about
them
when
they
took
upon
themselves
the
rites
which
were
to
unite
them
for
the
rest
of
their
two
lives
aside
from
tony
sorrow
the
only
two
regrets
which
marred
the
household
joy
that
bride
white
day
were
ted
absence
and
imminent
departure
for
france
and
that
other
even
soberer
remembrance
of
that
other
gallant
young
soldier
ruth
brother
roderick
of
whom
no
news
had
come
though
ruth
insisted
that
rod
was
dead
that
he
would
came
back
just
as
her
vivid
memory
of
him
had
returned
and
it
happened
that
her
faith
was
rewarded
and
on
the
very
day
of
days
when
one
drop
more
of
happiness
made
the
cup
fairly
spill
over
larry
was
summoned
to
the
telephone
just
as
he
had
been
once
before
on
a
certain
memorable
occasion
to
be
told
that
a
cabled
message
awaited
him
the
message
was
from
geoffrey
annersley
and
bore
besides
his
love
and
congratulations
the
wonderful
news
that
roderick
farringdon
had
escaped
from
a
german
prison
camp
and
was
safe
in
england
ruth
shed
many
happy
tears
over
this
best
of
all
bridal
gifts
not
enough
to
dim
the
shining
blue
of
her
eyes
but
enough
to
give
them
a
lovely
misty
tenderness
which
made
her
sweeter
than
ever
larry
thought
and
who
should
have
magic
eyes
if
not
a
bridegroom
a
little
later
came
carlotta
and
dick
the
latter
well
and
strong
again
but
thin
and
pale
and
rather
sober
tony
loved
him
for
grieving
for
alan
as
she
knew
he
did
he
too
had
known
and
loved
the
dead
man
and
understood
him
perhaps
better
than
she
had
herself
for
after
all
no
man
and
woman
can
ever
fully
understand
each
other
especially
if
they
are
in
love
so
many
faint
nuances
of
doubt
and
fear
and
pride
and
passion
and
jealousy
are
forever
drifting
between
lovers
obscuring
clarity
of
vision
carlotta
was
prettier
than
ever
with
a
new
sweetness
and
womanliness
which
her
love
had
wrought
in
her
during
the
year
people
who
had
known
her
mother
said
she
was
growing
daily
more
like
rose
though
always
before
they
had
traced
a
greater
resemblance
to
the
other
side
of
the
house
to
her
aunt
lottie
particularly
she
and
philip
were
to
be
married
in
the
spring
when
the
orioles
come
carlotta
had
said
remembering
her
father
story
of
that
other
brief
mating
tony
and
carlotta
slipped
away
from
the
others
to
talk
by
themselves
carlotta
too
had
known
and
liked
alan
and
to
all
such
tony
clung
just
now
he
was
so
different
at
the
end
she
said
to
her
friend
i
wish
you
could
have
known
him
that
way
so
dear
and
gentle
and
wonderful
he
kept
his
promise
everyway
lived
absolutely
straight
and
clean
and
fine
he
did
it
for
you
tony
he
never
could
have
done
it
for
himself
he
would
have
thought
it
worth
while
do
tell
me
if
you
do
want
to
but
i
have
guessed
a
good
many
things
since
i
knew
about
dick
and
i
have
wondered
if
he
was
rather
glad
to
get
killed
yes
dick
thinks
and
i
think
too
that
he
let
the
dagger
find
him
i
have
always
called
him
my
royal
lover
his
death
was
the
most
royal
part
of
all
carlotta
was
silent
she
hoped
that
somewhere
alan
was
finding
the
happiness
he
seemed
always
to
have
missed
on
earth
then
seeing
her
friend
lovely
eyes
with
the
heavy
shadow
in
them
where
there
had
been
only
sunshine
before
her
heart
rebelled
poor
tony
why
must
she
suffer
like
this
she
was
so
young
was
life
really
over
for
her
for
carlotta
in
her
own
happiness
life
and
love
were
synonymous
terms
something
of
what
was
in
her
mind
she
said
to
her
friend
i
do
know
confessed
tony
it
is
too
soon
to
tell
just
now
alan
fills
every
nook
and
cranny
of
me
i
ca
think
of
any
other
man
or
imagine
myself
loving
anybody
else
as
i
loved
him
but
i
am
a
very
much
alive
person
i
do
believe
i
shall
give
myself
to
death
forever
alan
himself
would
want
it
so
a
part
of
me
will
always
be
his
but
there
are
other
margins
of
me
that
alan
never
touched
and
these
maybe
i
shall
give
to
some
one
else
when
the
time
comes
does
that
mean
dick
john
massey
maybe
maybe
not
i
have
told
him
not
to
speak
of
love
for
a
long
long
time
we
must
both
be
free
he
is
going
to
france
as
a
war
correspondent
next
week
do
you
hate
to
have
him
go
yes
i
do
but
i
ca
be
selfish
enough
to
keep
him
hanging
round
me
forever
on
the
slim
chance
that
some
time
i
shall
be
willing
to
marry
him
he
is
too
fine
to
be
treated
like
that
he
wants
to
go
overseas
unless
i
will
marry
him
now
and
i
ca
do
that
it
is
better
that
we
should
be
apart
for
a
while
as
for
me
i
have
my
work
and
i
am
going
to
plunge
into
it
as
deep
and
hard
as
i
can
i
am
not
going
to
be
unhappy
you
ca
be
unhappy
when
you
love
your
work
as
i
love
mine
do
be
sorry
for
me
carlotta
i
am
not
sorry
for
myself
even
if
i
never
loved
again
and
never
was
loved
i
should
still
have
had
enough
for
a
life
time
it
is
more
than
many
women
have
more
than
i
deserve
the
bride
white
day
wore
on
to
twilight
and
as
the
clock
struck
the
hour
of
five
ruth
farringdon
came
down
the
broad
oak
staircase
clad
in
the
shining
splendor
of
the
bridal
gown
she
had
dreamed
wearing
her
grandmother
pearls
and
the
lace
veil
which
larry
lovely
mother
had
worn
as
ned
holiday
bride
long
and
long
ago
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
larry
waited
and
took
her
hand
eric
and
hester
flanking
the
living
room
door
pushed
aside
the
curtains
for
the
two
who
still
hand
in
hand
walked
past
the
children
into
the
room
where
the
others
were
assembled
gravely
and
brimming
with
importance
the
guard
of
honor
followed
the
latter
bearing
the
bride
bouquet
the
former
squeezing
the
wedding
ring
in
his
small
fist
ruth
took
her
place
beside
the
senior
doctor
the
minister
opened
his
mouth
to
proceed
with
the
ceremony
shut
it
again
with
a
little
gasp
for
suddenly
the
curtains
were
swept
aside
again
this
time
with
a
breezier
and
less
stately
sweep
and
ted
holiday
in
uniform
and
regalia
plunged
into
the
room
a
thinner
browner
taller
ted
with
a
new
kind
of
dignity
about
him
but
withal
the
same
lad
with
the
old
heart
warming
smile
still
always
teddy
the
beloved
do
mind
me
he
announced
please
go
on
and
he
slipped
into
a
place
beside
tony
drawing
her
hand
in
his
with
a
warm
pressure
as
he
did
so
they
went
on
laurence
larue
holiday
and
elinor
ruth
farringdon
were
made
man
and
wife
till
death
did
them
part
the
old
clock
on
the
mantel
which
had
looked
down
on
these
two
on
a
less
happy
occasion
looked
on
still
ticking
away
calmly
telling
no
tales
and
asking
no
questions
what
was
a
marriage
more
or
less
to
time
the
ceremony
over
it
was
the
newly
arrived
sergeant
rather
than
the
bride
and
groom
who
was
the
center
of
attraction
and
none
were
better
pleased
than
larry
and
ruth
to
have
it
so
it
was
a
flying
visit
on
ted
part
he
had
managed
to
secure
a
last
minute
leave
just
before
sailing
from
montreal
at
which
place
he
had
to
report
the
day
after
so
let
eat
drink
and
be
merry
he
finished
his
explanation
gayly
but
first
please
larry
may
i
kiss
the
bride
go
to
it
laughed
his
brother
i
so
hanged
glad
to
see
you
kid
half
a
mind
to
kiss
you
myself
needing
no
further
urging
ted
availed
himself
of
the
proffered
privilege
and
kissed
the
bride
not
once
but
three
times
once
on
each
rosy
cheek
and
last
full
on
her
pretty
mouth
itself
there
he
announced
standing
off
to
survey
her
both
her
hands
still
in
his
possession
i
always
wanted
to
do
that
and
now
i
done
it
i
feel
better
everybody
laughed
at
that
not
because
what
he
said
was
so
very
amusing
as
because
their
hearts
were
so
full
of
joy
to
have
the
irrepressible
youngest
holiday
at
home
again
after
the
long
anxious
weeks
of
his
absence
under
cover
of
the
laugh
he
whispered
in
ruth
ear
gee
but
glad
you
are
all
right
again
sweetness
and
your
geoffrey
annersley
is
some
peach
of
a
cousin
i
telling
you
though
i
confoundedly
glad
he
decided
he
was
married
to
somebody
else
and
left
the
coast
clear
for
larry
he
squeezed
her
hand
again
a
pressure
which
meant
more
than
his
words
as
ruth
knew
and
then
he
turned
to
larry
the
hands
of
the
two
brothers
met
and
each
looked
into
the
other
face
for
once
unashamed
of
the
emotion
that
mastered
them
characteristically
ted
was
the
first
to
recover
speech
larry
dear
old
chap
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
how
happy
i
am
that
it
has
come
out
so
ripping
right
for
you
and
ruth
you
deserve
all
the
luck
and
love
in
the
world
i
only
wish
mother
and
dad
could
be
here
now
maybe
they
are
i
believe
they
must
know
somehow
dad
seems
awfully
close
to
me
lately
especially
since
i
been
in
this
war
business
then
seeing
larry
face
shadow
he
added
and
you
must
worry
about
me
old
man
i
am
going
to
come
through
and
it
is
all
right
anyway
whatever
happens
you
know
yourself
death
is
so
much
not
such
a
horrible
calamity
as
we
talk
as
if
it
were
i
know
but
it
is
horribly
hard
to
reconcile
myself
to
your
going
i
ca
seem
to
make
up
my
mind
to
accept
it
especially
as
you
have
gone
do
let
that
part
bother
you
the
old
will
be
in
it
herself
before
you
know
it
and
then
i
have
gone
anyway
nothing
would
have
kept
me
what
is
the
odds
i
am
glad
to
be
getting
in
on
the
front
row
myself
i
am
going
to
be
all
right
i
tell
you
going
to
have
a
bully
time
and
when
we
have
the
germans
jolly
well
licked
i
coming
home
and
find
me
as
pretty
a
wife
as
ruth
if
there
is
one
to
be
found
in
america
and
marry
her
quick
as
lightning
larry
smiled
at
that
it
was
so
like
ted
it
was
good
to
hear
and
irrationally
enough
he
found
himself
more
than
a
little
reassured
and
comforted
because
the
other
lad
declared
he
was
going
to
be
all
right
and
have
a
bully
time
and
come
back
safe
when
the
job
was
done
and
i
say
larry
ted
voice
was
soberer
now
i
have
always
wanted
to
tell
you
how
i
appreciated
your
standing
by
me
so
magnificently
in
that
horrible
mess
of
mine
i
would
have
blamed
you
if
you
had
felt
like
throwing
me
over
for
life
after
my
being
such
a
tarnation
idiot
and
disgracing
the
family
like
that
i
never
forget
how
white
you
and
uncle
phil
both
were
about
it
every
way
and
maybe
you
wo
believe
it
but
there
never
be
anything
like
that
again
there
are
some
things
i
through
with
at
least
if
i
not
i
even
more
of
a
fool
than
i
think
i
am
do
ted
i
have
been
such
a
model
of
virtue
and
wisdom
that
i
can
afford
to
sit
in
judgment
on
you
i
learned
a
few
things
myself
this
year
and
i
am
not
so
cock
sure
in
my
views
as
i
was
by
a
long
shot
anyway
you
have
more
than
made
up
by
what
you
have
done
since
and
what
you
are
going
to
do
over
there
let
forget
the
rest
and
just
remember
that
we
are
both
holidays
and
it
is
up
to
both
of
us
to
measure
up
to
dad
and
uncle
phil
far
as
we
can
some
stunt
what
thus
ted
flippantly
mixed
his
familiar
american
and
newly
acquired
british
vernacular
you
are
dead
right
larry
i
am
afraid
i
doomed
to
land
some
nine
miles
or
so
below
the
mark
but
going
to
make
a
stab
at
it
anyway
later
there
was
a
gala
dinner
party
an
occasion
almost
as
gay
as
that
round
table
banquet
over
eight
years
ago
had
been
when
dick
carson
had
been
formally
inducted
into
the
order
and
doctor
holiday
had
announced
that
he
was
going
to
marry
miss
margery
and
as
before
there
was
laughter
and
gay
talk
and
teasing
affectionate
jest
and
prophecy
mingled
with
the
toasting
there
were
toasts
to
the
reigning
bride
and
groom
larry
and
ruth
to
the
coming
bride
and
groom
philip
and
carlotta
to
tony
the
understudy
that
was
the
star
that
was
to
be
to
dick
carson
that
had
been
john
massey
that
was
foreign
correspondent
and
future
famous
author
there
was
a
particularly
stirring
toast
to
sergeant
ted
who
would
some
day
be
returning
to
his
native
shore
at
least
a
captain
if
not
a
major
with
all
kinds
of
adventures
and
honors
to
his
credit
everybody
smiled
gallantly
over
this
toast
not
one
of
them
would
let
a
shadow
of
grief
or
dread
for
teddy
the
beloved
cloud
this
one
happy
home
evening
of
his
before
he
left
the
hill
perhaps
forever
the
holidays
were
like
that
and
then
larry
on
his
feet
raised
his
hand
for
silence
last
and
best
of
all
he
said
i
give
you
the
head
of
the
house
of
holiday
the
best
friend
and
the
finest
man
i
know
uncle
phil
larry
smiled
down
at
his
uncle
as
he
spoke
but
there
was
deep
feeling
in
his
fine
gray
eyes
better
than
any
one
else
he
knew
how
much
of
his
present
happiness
he
owed
to
that
good
friend
and
fine
man
philip
holiday
the
whole
table
rose
to
this
toast
except
the
doctor
even
to
the
small
eric
and
hester
who
had
no
idea
what
it
was
all
about
but
found
it
all
very
exciting
and
delightful
and
beautifully
grown
up
as
they
drank
the
toast
ted
free
hand
rested
with
affectionate
pressure
on
his
uncle
and
tony
on
the
other
side
set
down
her
glass
and
squeezed
his
hand
instead
they
too
were
trying
to
tell
him
that
what
larry
had
spoken
in
his
own
behalf
was
true
for
them
also
they
wanted
to
have
him
know
how
much
he
meant
to
them
and
how
much
they
wanted
to
do
and
be
for
his
dear
sake
perhaps
philip
holiday
won
his
order
of
distinguished
service
then
and
there
at
any
rate
with
his
own
children
and
ned
around
him
with
the
wife
of
his
heart
smiling
down
at
him
from
across
the
table
with
proud
happy
tear
wet
eyes
the
head
of
the
house
of
holiday
was
content
the
end
