the
whole

exploded

said
blake
looking
up
from
his
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
own
face
now
then
there
nothing
to
laugh
look
here
he
added
turning
to
the
new
boy
how
spell
it
instead
of
being
at
all
annoyed
or
disconcerted
at
the
mirth
of
his
the
youngster
seemed
rather
to
enjoy
the
joke
and
immediately
rattled
out
a
reply
to
the
question

then
turning
round
he
smiled
complacently
at
the
occupants
of
the
desks
behind
as
much
as
to
say
there
i
done
all
i
can
to
amuse
you
and
i
hope
you
satisfied
this
incident
one
of
the
little
pleasantries
occasionally
permitted
by
a
class
master
and
which
like
a
judge
jokes
in
court
are
always
welcomed
as
a
momentary
relief
from
the
depressing
monotony
of
the
serious
business
in
hand
this
little
incident
i
say
happened
in
the
second
class
of
a
small
preparatory
school
situated
on
the
outskirts
of
the
market
town
of
chatford
and
intended
according
to
the
wording
of
a
standing
advertisement
in
the
for
the
sons
of
gentlemen
this
establishment
which
bore
the
somewhat
suggestive
name
of
the
birches
was
owned
and
presided
over
by
welsby
who
with
an
unmarried
daughter
miss
eleanor
acting
as
housekeeper
and
his
nephew
blake
performing
the
duties
of
undertook
the
preliminary
education
of
about
a
dozen
juveniles
whose
ages
ranged
between
ten
and
fourteen
on
the
previous
evening
returning
from
the
christmas
holidays
exactly
twelve
had
mustered
round
the
big
table
in
the
no
new
faces
had
appeared
and
fred
acton
a
big
strong
youngster
of
fourteen
and
a
half
was
undisputed
cock
of
the
walk
the
school
was
divided
into
two
classes
the
first
containing
the
five
elder
scholars
went
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
welsby
himself
while
the
second
remained
behind
in
what
was
known
as
the
schoolroom
and
received
instruction
from
blake
it
was
while
thus
occupied
on
the
first
morning
of
the
term
that
the
lower
division
were
surprised
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
new
boy
miss
eleanor
brought
him
into
the
room
and
after
a
few
whispered
conversation
with
her
cousin
smiled
round
the
class
and
then
withdrew
every
one
worshipped
miss
eleanor
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
a
moment
later
blake
put
the
question
which
stands
at
the
commencement
of
this
chapter
the
answer
made
a
favourable
impression
on
the
minds
of
his
companions
and
as
soon
as
the
morning
work
was
over
they
set
about
the
task
of
mutual
introduction
in
a
far
more
friendly
manner
than
was
customary
on
these
occasions
he
was
a
wiry
little
chap
with
bright
eyes
for
ever
on
the
twinkle
and
black
hair
pasted
down
upon
his
head
so
as
not
to
show
the
slightest
vestige
of
curl
while
the
sharp
mischievous
look
on
his
face
and
the
quick
comical
movements
of
his
body
suggested
something
between
a
terrier
and
a
monkey
there
was
never
very
much
going
on
in
the
way
of
regular
sports
or
pastimes
at
the
birches
the
smallness
of
numbers
made
it
difficult
to
attempt
proper
games
of
cricket
or
football
and
the
boys
were
forced
to
content
themselves
with
such
substitutes
as
prisoner
base
cross
tag
or
in
carrying
out
the
projects
of
fred
acton
who
was
constantly
making
suggestions
for
the
employment
of
their
time
and
compelling
everybody
to
conform
to
his
wishes
welsby
had
been
a
widower
for
many
years
he
was
a
grave
scholarly
man
who
spent
most
of
his
spare
time
in
his
own
library
blake
was
supposed
to
take
charge
out
of
school
hours
he
was
as
every
one
said
a
jolly
fellow
and
the
fact
that
his
popularity
extended
far
and
wide
among
a
large
circle
of
friends
and
acquaintances
caused
him
to
have
a
good
many
irons
in
the
fire
of
one
sort
and
another
during
their
hours
of
leisure
therefore
the
birchites
were
left
pretty
much
to
their
own
devices
or
more
often
to
those
of
master
fred
acton
who
liked
as
has
already
been
stated
to
assume
the
office
of
bellwether
to
the
little
flock
at
the
time
when
our
story
commences
the
ground
was
covered
with
snow
but
acton
was
equal
to
the
occasion
and
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
ordered
all
hands
to
come
outside
and
make
a
slide
the
garden
was
on
a
steep
slope
along
the
bottom
of
which
ran
the
brick
wall
bounding
one
side
of
the
playground
a
straight
steep
path
lay
between
this
and
the
house
and
the
youthful
dux
with
his
usual
disregard
of
life
and
limb
insisted
on
choosing
this
as
the
scene
of
operations
what
he
cried
in
answer
to
a
feeble
protest
on
the
part
of
mugford
make
it
on
level
ground
of
course
not
when
we
got
this
jolly
hill
to
go
down
not
if
i
know
it
we
open
the
door
at
the
bottom
and
go
right
on
into
the
playground
but
how
if
any
one
goes
a
bit
crooked
and
runs
up
against
the
bricks
well
they
get
pretty
well
smashed
or
he
will
you
must
go
straight
that
half
the
fun
of
the
thing
it
make
it
all
the
more
exciting
come
on
and
begin
to
tread
down
the
snow
without
daring
to
show
any
outward
signs
of
reluctance
but
with
feelings
very
much
akin
to
those
of
men
digging
their
own
graves
before
being
shot
the
company
set
about
putting
this
fearful
project
into
execution
in
about
half
an
hour
the
slide
was
in
good
working
order
and
then
the
fun
began
mugford
and
one
or
two
others
whose
prudence
exceeded
their
valour
made
a
point
of
sitting
down
before
they
had
gone
many
yards
preferring
to
take
the
fall
in
a
milder
form
than
it
would
have
assumed
at
a
later
period
in
the
journey
to
the
bolder
spirits
however
every
trip
was
like
leading
a
forlorn
hope
none
expecting
to
return
from
the
enterprise
unscathed
the
pace
was
terrific
on
nearing
the
playground
wall
all
the
events
of
a
lifetime
might
have
flashed
across
the
memory
as
at
the
last
gasp
of
a
drowning
man
and
if
fortunate
enough
to
whiz
through
the
doorway
and
pull
up
all
standing
on
the
level
stretch
beyond
it
was
to
draw
a
deep
breath
and
regard
the
successful
performance
of
the
feat
as
an
escape
from
catastrophe
which
was
nothing
short
of
miraculous
the
unevenness
of
the
ground
made
it
almost
impossible
to
steer
a
straight
course
a
boy
might
be
down
the
path
when
suddenly
he
felt
himself
beginning
to
turn
round
an
agonized
look
spread
over
his
face
he
made
one
frantic
attempt
to
keep
as
it
were
head
to
the
sea
there
was
an
awful
moment
when
house
garden
sky
and
playground
wall
spun
round
and
round
and
then
the
little
group
of
onlookers
their
hearts
hardened
by
their
own
sufferings
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
while
acton
slapped
his
leg
crying
he
over
what
a
stunning
lark
who
next
at
the
end
of
an
hour
and
a
half
most
of
the
company
were
temporarily
disabled
and
even
their
chief
had
not
escaped
scot
free
now
then
for
a
regular
spanker
he
cried
rushing
at
the
slide
a
spanker
it
certainly
was
six
yards
from
the
commencement
his
legs
flew
from
under
him
he
soared
into
the
air
like
a
bird
and
did
not
touch
the
ground
again
until
he
sat
down
heavily
within
twenty
paces
of
the
bottom
of
the
slope
one
might
have
supposed
that
this
catastrophe
would
have
somewhat
damped
the
sufferer
ardour
but
instead
of
that
he
only
seemed
fired
with
a
fresh
desire
to
break
his
neck
he
hobbled
up
the
hill
and
pausing
for
a
moment
at
the
top
to
take
breath
suddenly
exclaimed
look
here
i
going
down
it
on
skates
every
one
stood
aghast
at
this
rash
determination
but
acton
hurried
off
into
the
house
and
soon
returned
with
the
skates
he
sat
down
on
a
bank
and
was
proceeding
to
put
them
on
when
he
discovered
that
by
some
oversight
he
had
brought
out
the
wrong
pair
bother
it
these
are
mine
they
too
short
whose
are
they
i
think
they
mine
faltered
mugford
well
put
on
but
i
do
want
to
but
i
say
you
must
oh
please
acton
i
really
ca
i
shut
up
look
here
some
one
got
to
go
down
that
slide
on
skates
so
just
put
on
it
was
at
this
moment
that
diggory
trevanock
stepped
forward
and
remarked
in
a
casual
manner
that
if
mugford
did
wish
to
do
it
but
would
lend
him
the
skates
he
himself
would
go
down
the
slide
his
companions
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
coupled
with
which
was
a
feeling
of
regret
he
was
a
nice
little
chap
and
they
had
already
begun
to
like
him
and
did
not
wish
to
see
him
dashed
to
pieces
against
the
playground
wall
before
their
very
eyes
acton
however
had
decreed
that
some
one
had
got
to
go
down
that
slide
on
skates
and
it
seemed
only
meet
and
right
that
if
a
victim
had
to
be
sacrificed
it
should
be
a
new
boy
rather
than
an
old
stager
bravo
cried
the
dux
here
one
chap
at
least
who
no
funk
put
on
sharp
the
bell
ring
in
a
minute
several
willing
hands
were
stretched
out
to
assist
in
arming
diggory
for
the
enterprise
and
in
a
few
moments
he
was
assisted
to
the
top
of
the
slide
all
right
he
said
let
go
the
spectators
held
their
breath
hardly
daring
to
watch
what
would
happen
but
fortune
favours
the
brave
the
adventurous
juvenile
rushed
down
the
path
shot
like
an
arrow
through
the
doorway
and
the
next
instant
was
seen
ploughing
up
the
snow
in
the
playground
and
eventually
disappearing
head
first
into
the
middle
of
a
big
drift
his
companions
all
rushed
down
in
a
body
to
haul
him
out
of
the
snow
acton
smacked
him
on
the
back
and
called
him
a
trump
while
jack
vance
presented
him
on
the
spot
with
a
which
had
been
slightly
damaged
in
one
of
the
donor
many
tumbles
but
was
as
he
remarked
just
as
good
as
new
for
eating
from
that
moment
until
the
day
he
left
there
was
never
a
more
popular
boy
at
the
birches
than
diggory
trevanock
i
say
remarked
mugford
as
they
met
a
short
time
later
in
the
that
was
awfully
good
of
you
to
go
down
the
slide
instead
of
me
what
ever
made
you
do
it
well
answered
the
other
calmly
i
thought
it
would
save
me
a
lot
of
bother
if
i
showed
you
fellows
at
once
that
i
was
a
muff
i
mind
telling
you
i
was
in
rather
a
funk
when
it
came
to
the
start
but
i
said
i
do
it
and
of
course
i
could
draw
back
the
numerous
stirring
events
which
happened
at
the
birches
during
the
next
three
terms
and
which
it
will
be
my
pleasing
duty
to
chronicle
in
subsequent
chapters
gave
the
boys
plenty
of
opportunity
of
testing
the
character
of
their
new
companion
or
in
plainer
english
of
finding
out
the
stuff
he
was
made
of
and
whatever
his
other
faults
may
have
been
this
at
least
is
certain
that
no
one
ever
found
occasion
to
charge
diggory
trevanock
with
being
either
a
muff
or
a
coward
one
might
have
thought
that
the
slide
episode
would
have
afforded
excitement
enough
for
a
new
boy
first
day
at
school
yet
before
it
closed
he
was
destined
to
be
mixed
up
in
an
adventure
of
a
still
more
thrilling
character
the
birches
was
an
old
house
and
though
its
outward
appearance
was
modern
enough
the
interior
impressed
even
youthful
minds
with
a
feeling
of
reverence
for
its
age
the
heavy
timbers
the
queer
shape
of
some
of
the
bedrooms
and
attics
the
narrow
crooked
passages
and
the
little
unexpected
flights
of
stairs
were
all
things
belonging
to
a
bygone
age
of
which
the
pupils
were
secretly
proud
and
which
caused
them
to
remember
the
place
and
think
of
it
at
the
time
as
being
in
some
way
different
from
an
ordinary
school
i
say
diggy
exclaimed
jack
vance
addressing
the
new
boy
by
the
friendly
abbreviation
which
seemed
by
mutual
consent
to
have
been
bestowed
upon
him
in
recognition
of
his
daring
exploit
i
say
diggy
you
in
my
bedroom
there
you
and
me
and
mugford
mug
an
awful
chump
but
he
a
old
duffer
and
you
and
i
do
the
fighting
what
do
you
mean
why
sometimes
when
blake
is
out
spending
the
evening
and
old
welsby
is
shut
up
in
his
library
the
different
rooms
make
raids
on
one
another
it
began
the
term
before
last
blake
had
been
teaching
us
all
about
how
the
crusaders
used
to
go
out
every
now
and
then
and
make
war
in
palestine
and
so
the
fellows
on
the
west
side
of
the
house
called
themselves
the
crusaders
and
we
were
infidels
and
they
come
over
and
rag
us
and
we
should
drive
them
back
miss
eleanor
came
up
one
night
and
caught
us
in
the
middle
of
a
battle
o
diggy
she
is
a
trump
blake
asked
her
next
day
before
us
all
which
boys
had
been
out
on
the
landing
because
he
meant
to
punish
them
and
she
laughed
and
said
sure
i
ca
tell
you
why
when
i
saw
they
were
all
in
their
i
shut
my
eyes
at
once
of
course
it
was
all
an
excuse
for
not
giving
us
away
she
does
mind
seeing
chaps
in
their
when
they
ill
we
all
know
that
and
once
or
twice
when
for
some
reason
or
other
she
told
us
on
the
quiet
that
there
must
be
any
disturbance
that
evening
no
one
ever
went
crusading
acton
would
have
licked
them
if
they
had
acton
going
to
propose
to
miss
eleanor
some
day
he
told
us
so
and
but
what
about
the
bedrooms
interrupted
diggory
have
you
given
up
having
crusades
yes
but
we
have
other
things
instead
we
call
our
rooms
by
different
names
and
it
all
against
all
one
lot
come
and
make
a
raid
on
you
and
then
you
go
and
pay
them
out
this
term
kennedy
and
jacobs
sleep
in
the
room
above
ours
and
next
to
the
big
attic
they
always
reading
sea
stories
and
they
call
their
room
the
because
it
so
high
up
then
at
the
end
of
the
passage
are
acton
shaw
and
morris
and
they
the
of
lords
and
next
to
them
is
the
home
where
all
the
other
fellows
are
put
a
few
hours
later
diggory
and
his
two
were
standing
at
the
foot
of
their
beds
and
discussing
the
formation
of
a
few
simple
rules
for
conducting
a
race
in
undressing
the
last
man
to
put
the
candle
out
you
need
bother
to
race
said
mugford
i
do
it
i
sure
to
be
the
last
no
you
are
answered
vance
we
give
you
coat
and
waistcoat
start
it
be
good
fun
at
this
moment
the
door
was
suddenly
flung
open
two
figures
sprang
into
the
room
and
discharged
a
couple
of
snowballs
at
its
occupants
one
of
the
missiles
struck
diggory
on
the
shoulder
and
the
other
struck
mugford
fair
and
square
on
the
side
of
the
head
the
fragments
flying
all
over
the
floor
there
was
a
subdued
yell
of
triumph
the
door
was
slammed
to
with
a
bang
and
the
muffled
sound
of
stockinged
feet
thudding
up
the
neighbouring
staircase
showed
that
the
enemy
were
in
full
retreat
it
those
confounded
men
cried
jack
vance
i
will
pay
them
out
i
wonder
where
the
fellows
got
the
snow
from
oh
i
expect
they
opened
the
window
and
took
it
off
the
ledge
answered
diggory
look
here
let
sweep
it
up
into
this
piece
of
paper
before
it
melts
this
having
been
done
the
three
friends
hastily
threw
off
their
clothes
and
scrambled
into
bed
forgetting
all
about
the
proposed
race
in
their
eagerness
to
form
some
plan
for
an
immediate
retaliation
on
the
occupants
of
the
i
wonder
if
they
hear
anything
of
the
ghost
again
this
term
said
mugford
what
ghost
asked
diggory
oh
it
nothing
really
answered
vance
only
somebody
said
once
that
the
house
is
haunted
and
kennedy
and
jacobs
say
the
ghost
must
be
in
the
big
attic
next
their
room
they
hear
such
queer
noises
sometimes
that
they
both
go
under
the
do
they
always
do
that
yes
so
they
say
whenever
there
is
a
row
well
then
said
diggory
i
tell
you
what
we
do
we
go
very
quietly
up
into
that
attic
and
groan
and
knock
on
the
wall
until
you
think
they
both
got
their
heads
well
under
the
clothes
and
then
we
rush
in
and
bag
their
pillows
or
drag
them
out
of
bed
or
something
of
that
sort
you
are
afraid
to
go
into
the
attic
are
you
he
continued
seeing
that
the
others
hesitated
why
of
course
there
are
no
such
things
as
ghosts
or
look
here
i
go
in
and
you
can
wait
outside
n
no
i
do
mind
answered
vance
and
it
be
an
awful
lark
catching
them
with
their
heads
under
the
clothes
all
right
then
let
do
it
though
i
suppose
we
better
wait
till
every
one
in
bed
the
last
suggestion
was
agreed
upon
and
the
three
friends
lay
talking
in
an
undertone
until
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
the
gleam
of
a
candle
above
the
door
announced
the
fact
that
blake
was
retiring
to
rest
he
always
last
said
vance
we
must
give
him
time
to
undress
and
then
we
start
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
three
boys
in
were
creeping
in
single
file
up
the
narrow
staircase
be
careful
whispered
vance
there
are
several
loose
boards
and
they
crack
like
anything
the
small
landing
was
reached
in
safety
and
the
moon
shining
faintly
through
a
little
skylight
formed
of
a
single
pane
of
glass
enabled
them
to
distinguish
the
outline
of
two
doors
now
it
was
a
very
different
matter
when
lying
warm
and
snug
in
bed
to
talk
about
acting
the
ghost
from
what
it
was
when
standing
shivering
in
the
cold
and
darkness
to
put
the
project
into
execution
during
the
period
of
waiting
the
conversation
had
turned
on
haunted
houses
and
no
one
seemed
particularly
anxious
to
claim
as
it
were
the
post
of
honour
and
be
the
first
to
enter
the
big
attic
go
on
whispered
mugford
nudging
vance
go
on
repeated
the
latter
giving
diggory
arm
a
gentle
push
the
new
boy
had
certainly
undertaken
to
play
the
part
of
the
ghost
and
there
was
no
excuse
for
his
backing
out
of
it
at
the
last
moment
all
right
he
muttered
i
go
just
then
a
terrible
thing
happened
diggory
clutched
the
as
though
it
were
the
handle
of
a
galvanic
battery
while
mugford
and
vance
seized
each
other
by
the
arm
and
literally
gasped
for
breath
the
stillness
had
been
broken
by
a
slight
sound
as
of
something
falling
inside
the
attic
and
this
was
followed
a
moment
later
by
a
shrill
unearthly
scream
for
five
seconds
the
three
companions
stood
petrified
with
horror
not
daring
to
move
then
followed
another
scream
if
anything
more
horrible
than
the
last
and
accompanied
this
time
by
the
clanking
rattle
of
a
chain
being
dragged
across
the
floor
that
was
enough
talk
about
a
qui
the
wonder
is
that
any
one
survived
the
stampede
which
followed
the
youngsters
turned
and
flew
down
the
stairs
at
speed
and
hardly
had
they
started
when
the
door
of
the
was
flung
open
and
its
two
occupants
rushed
down
after
them
as
though
to
ensure
the
retreat
being
nothing
less
than
a
regular
rout
mugford
who
was
leading
missed
his
footing
on
the
last
step
causing
every
one
to
fall
over
him
in
turn
until
all
five
boys
were
sprawling
together
in
a
mixed
heap
upon
the
floor
freeing
themselves
with
some
little
difficulty
from
the
general
entanglement
they
rose
to
their
feet
and
after
surveying
each
other
for
a
moment
in
silence
gave
vent
to
a
simultaneous
ejaculation
of
what
were
you
fellows
doing
up
there
asked
kennedy
why
we
came
up
to
have
a
joke
with
you
answered
vance
but
just
when
we
got
up
to
the
landing
it
it
made
that
noise
there
was
the
sound
of
the
key
turning
in
the
lock
of
blake
door
whispered
mugford
tell
him
about
it
added
vance
and
giving
diggory
a
push
they
all
three
darted
into
their
room
just
as
the
master
emerged
from
his
arrayed
in
and
slippers
now
then
exclaimed
the
latter
holding
his
candle
above
his
head
and
peering
down
the
passage
what
the
meaning
of
this
disturbance
i
thought
the
whole
house
was
falling
come
here
you
two
and
explain
yourselves
please
sir
answered
kennedy
and
jacobs
in
one
breath
it
the
ghost
the
ghost
what
ghost
what
mean
the
two
men
began
a
hasty
account
of
the
cause
of
their
sudden
fright
taking
care
however
to
make
no
mention
of
the
three
hostile
visitors
who
had
shared
in
the
surprise
blake
listened
to
their
story
in
silence
then
all
at
once
he
burst
out
laughing
and
without
a
word
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
quickly
upstairs
he
entered
the
attic
and
in
about
half
a
minute
they
heard
him
coming
back
ha
ha
i
got
your
ghost
i
been
trying
to
lay
him
for
some
time
past
the
jingle
of
a
chain
was
distinctly
audible
blake
was
evidently
bringing
the
spectre
down
in
his
arms
diggory
and
vance
could
no
longer
restrain
their
curiosity
they
hopped
out
of
bed
and
glanced
round
the
corner
of
the
door
the
master
held
in
his
hand
a
rusty
old
gin
the
iron
jaws
of
which
were
tightly
closed
upon
the
body
of
an
enormous
rat
there
a
monster
for
you
he
said
i
think
it
the
biggest
i
ever
saw
he
carried
the
trap
chain
and
all
right
across
the
room
but
that
finished
him
he
was
as
dead
as
a
stone
when
i
picked
him
up
now
get
back
to
bed
i
should
think
you
both
nearly
frozen
diggory
and
jack
vance
followed
the
advice
given
to
kennedy
and
jacobs
and
did
so
rather
sheepishly
they
felt
they
had
been
making
tools
of
themselves
yet
it
would
never
have
done
to
own
to
such
a
thing
what
a
lark
said
the
new
boy
after
a
few
moments
silence
was
it
returned
jack
vance
it
the
best
joke
i
had
for
a
long
time
but
we
did
pay
those
fellows
out
for
throwing
those
snowballs
we
must
do
it
some
other
night
and
now
we
three
must
swear
to
be
friends
and
stand
by
each
other
against
all
the
world
and
whatever
happens
what
shall
we
call
our
room
i
know
answered
diggory
we
call
it
triple
alliance
chapter
ii
the
philistines
the
triple
alliance
the
formation
of
which
has
just
been
described
was
destined
to
be
no
mere
form
of
speech
or
empty
display
of
friendship
the
members
had
solemnly
sworn
to
stand
by
one
another
whatever
happened
and
the
manner
in
which
they
carried
out
their
resolve
and
the
important
consequences
which
resulted
from
their
concerted
actions
will
be
made
known
to
the
reader
as
our
story
progresses
poor
mugford
certainly
seemed
likely
to
be
a
heavy
drag
on
the
association
he
was
constantly
tumbling
into
trouble
and
needing
to
be
pulled
out
again
by
those
who
had
promised
to
be
his
friends
an
instance
of
this
occurred
on
the
day
following
diggory
arrival
at
the
birches
he
and
vance
had
gone
down
after
morning
school
into
what
was
called
the
playroom
to
partake
of
two
more
of
the
and
on
their
return
to
the
schoolroom
found
a
crowd
assembled
round
acton
who
seated
on
the
top
of
a
small
cupboard
which
always
served
as
a
judicial
bench
was
hearing
a
case
in
which
mugford
was
the
defendant
while
jacobs
and
another
boy
named
cross
appeared
as
plaintiffs
the
charge
was
that
the
former
was
indebted
to
the
latter
for
the
sum
of
half
a
crown
which
he
had
borrowed
towards
the
end
of
the
previous
term
in
separate
amounts
of
one
shilling
and
eighteen
pence
promising
to
repay
them
with
interest
immediately
after
the
holidays
the
money
had
been
expended
in
the
purchase
of
a
disreputable
old
canary
bird
for
which
noaks
the
manservant
had
agreed
to
find
board
and
lodging
during
the
christmas
vacation
now
when
the
creditors
reminded
mugford
of
his
obligations
they
found
him
totally
unable
to
meet
their
demands
for
payment
now
look
here
said
acton
addressing
the
defendant
with
great
severity
no
humbug
how
much
money
did
you
bring
back
with
you
well
i
had
to
pay
my
brother
before
i
came
away
for
my
share
in
a
telescope
we
bought
last
summer
and
then
bother
your
brother
and
the
telescope
why
ca
you
answer
my
question
how
much
money
did
you
bring
back
with
you
only
five
bob
then
why
in
the
name
of
fortune
do
you
pay
up
because
i
had
to
pay
all
that
to
noaks
for
mean
to
say
that
that
bird
ate
five
shillings
worth
of
seed
in
four
weeks
well
so
noaks
says
he
told
me
he
kept
scores
of
birds
in
his
time
but
he
seen
one
so
hearty
at
its
grub
before
those
were
the
very
words
he
used
and
he
said
it
was
eating
nearly
all
the
day
and
that
one
reason
why
it
looks
such
a
dowdy
colour
and
never
sings
well
all
i
can
say
is
if
you
believe
all
noaks
tells
you
you
a
fool
but
that
no
reason
why
these
two
chaps
should
be
done
out
of
their
money
so
now
how
are
you
going
to
pay
them
if
they
only
wait
till
given
out
began
mugford
oh
no
we
sha
interrupted
cross
he
only
gets
sixpence
a
week
and
he
always
breaking
windows
and
other
things
and
having
it
stopped
there
seemed
only
one
way
out
of
the
difficulty
and
that
was
to
put
as
it
were
an
execution
into
mugford
desk
and
realize
a
certain
amount
of
his
private
property
look
here
said
acton
he
must
sell
now
then
he
added
turning
to
the
defendant
just
shell
out
something
and
bring
it
here
at
once
and
we
have
an
auction
the
boy
walked
off
to
his
desk
and
after
rummaging
about
in
it
for
some
little
time
returned
with
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
small
articles
in
his
arms
which
he
proceeded
to
hand
up
one
by
one
for
the
inspection
what
this
oh
its
a
book
that
was
given
me
on
my
birthday
called
thoughts
for
little
thinkers
lofty
grandmother
said
acton
impatiently
what
else
have
you
got
well
here
a
wire
puzzle
only
i
think
a
bit
of
it
lost
and
the
clasp
of
a
cricket
belt
and
old
dick
rodman
chessboard
and
some
of
the
men
and
some
stuff
for
chilblains
and
oh
dry
up
interrupted
acton
what
bosh
who
expect
would
buy
any
of
that
rubbish
look
here
we
give
you
till
after
dinner
and
unless
you
find
something
sensible
by
then
we
shall
come
and
hunt
for
ourselves
that
just
like
mug
said
jack
vance
to
diggory
as
the
group
of
boys
slowly
dispersed
he
always
doing
something
stupid
but
i
suppose
as
we
made
that
alliance
we
ought
to
try
to
help
the
beggar
somehow
they
followed
their
unfortunate
comrade
to
his
desk
which
when
opened
displayed
a
perfect
chaos
of
ragged
books
loose
sheets
of
paper
broken
pieces
of
string
battered
cardboard
boxes
and
other
rubbish
look
here
mug
what
have
you
got
to
sell
you
have
to
fork
out
something
i
do
know
returned
the
other
mournfully
stirring
up
the
contents
of
the
desk
as
though
he
were
making
a
christmas
pudding
i
got
nothing
except
well
there
this
book
of
poe
of
adventure
mystery
and
imagination
and
my
and
perhaps
some
one
would
buy
these
patterns
or
this
he
turned
out
two
or
three
more
small
articles
and
laid
them
on
the
form
are
there
any
of
these
things
you
particularly
wish
to
keep
asked
diggory
because
if
so
vance
and
i
bid
for
them
and
then
you
can
buy
them
back
from
us
again
when
you
got
some
more
money
that
awfully
kind
of
you
answered
mugford
brightening
up
tell
you
what
i
should
like
to
keep
and
that
my
and
the
book
they
such
jolly
stories
pit
and
the
pendulum
always
gives
me
bad
dreams
and
premature
burial
makes
you
feel
certain
you
be
buried
alive
all
right
and
did
you
bring
a
cake
back
with
you
yes
well
then
sell
that
first
and
you
can
share
our
grub
the
auction
was
held
directly
after
dinner
the
cake
fetched
a
shilling
and
diggory
and
vance
bid
ninepence
each
for
the
book
and
so
mugford
came
out
of
his
difficulty
without
suffering
any
further
loss
than
what
was
afterwards
made
good
again
by
the
generosity
of
his
two
comrades
they
for
their
part
made
no
fuss
over
this
little
act
of
kindness
but
handed
the
book
and
over
to
mugford
without
waiting
for
the
money
and
little
thinking
what
an
important
part
these
trifling
possessions
would
play
in
the
subsequent
history
of
the
triple
alliance
the
sale
had
not
long
been
concluded
and
the
little
community
were
preparing
to
obey
acton
order
to
come
outside
when
the
latter
rushed
into
the
room
finning
with
rage
i
say
he
exclaimed
what
do
you
think
that
beast
of
a
noaks
has
done
why
he
gone
and
put
ashes
all
over
our
slide
in
their
heart
of
hearts
every
one
felt
decidedly
relieved
at
this
announcement
still
it
was
necessary
at
all
events
to
simulate
some
of
their
leader
wrath
and
accordingly
there
was
a
general
outcry
against
the
offender
oh
the
cad
what
an
awful
shame
let
tell
blake
etc
who
is
noaks
asked
diggory
is
he
that
man
who
brings
the
boots
in
every
morning
yes
that
so
answered
vance
he
hates
us
all
partly
i
believe
because
his
son
a
philistine
i
wonder
old
welsby
does
get
another
man
his
son
a
asked
diggory
but
at
that
moment
acton
came
marching
round
the
room
ordering
every
one
out
into
the
playground
and
jack
vance
hurried
off
to
get
his
cap
and
muffler
without
replying
to
the
question
sliding
was
out
of
the
question
and
the
house
of
lords
having
amused
themselves
for
a
time
by
capturing
small
boys
and
throwing
them
into
the
some
one
remarked
that
it
would
be
good
fun
to
build
a
snow
man
which
proposition
was
received
with
acclamation
and
all
hands
were
soon
hard
at
work
rolling
the
big
balls
which
were
to
form
the
base
of
the
statue
as
the
work
progressed
the
interest
in
it
increased
the
more
so
when
diggory
suggested
that
the
figure
should
be
supposed
to
represent
the
obnoxious
noaks
and
that
the
company
could
then
relieve
their
feelings
by
pelting
his
effigy
as
soon
as
it
was
completed
every
one
was
pleased
with
the
project
and
even
acton
who
as
a
rule
would
never
follow
up
any
plan
which
was
not
of
his
own
making
took
special
pains
to
cause
the
snow
man
to
bear
some
likeness
to
the
original
he
had
just
by
way
of
a
finishing
touch
expended
nearly
half
a
penny
bottle
of
red
ink
in
a
somewhat
exaggerated
reproduction
of
the
fiery
hue
of
noaks
nose
when
the
bell
rang
for
afternoon
school
and
the
bombardment
had
to
be
postponed
until
the
following
day
it
was
no
small
trial
of
patience
being
thus
obliged
to
wait
nearly
hours
before
wreaking
their
vengeance
on
the
effigy
still
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
boys
bottled
down
their
feelings
and
when
at
last
the
classes
were
dismissed
and
the
dux
cried
come
on
you
fellows
every
one
obeyed
the
summons
willingly
enough
there
had
been
a
slight
thaw
in
the
night
and
the
statue
stood
in
need
of
some
trifling
repairs
acton
suggested
therefore
that
the
before
dinner
should
be
devoted
to
putting
things
to
rights
and
to
making
some
small
additions
in
the
shape
of
pebbles
for
waistcoat
buttons
and
other
trifling
adornments
welsby
kept
the
boys
at
the
table
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
meal
was
finished
talking
over
his
plans
for
the
coming
term
and
when
at
last
he
finished
there
was
a
regular
stampede
for
the
playground
acton
was
leading
the
rush
he
dashed
through
the
garden
doorway
and
then
stopped
dead
with
an
exclamation
of
dismay
all
those
who
followed
as
they
arrived
on
the
spot
did
the
same
every
vestige
of
the
snow
man
which
had
been
left
barely
an
hour
ago
standing
such
a
work
of
art
had
disappeared
certainly
a
portion
of
the
pedestal
still
remained
looking
like
the
stump
of
an
old
decayed
tooth
but
the
figure
itself
had
been
thrown
down
trodden
flat
and
literally
stamped
out
of
existence
the
little
crowd
stood
for
a
moment
speechless
gazing
with
woebegone
expressions
on
their
faces
at
the
wreck
of
their
hopes
and
handiwork
then
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
subdued
chuckle
coming
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
on
their
left
and
every
one
with
a
start
and
a
sudden
clinching
of
fists
cried
simultaneously
the
philistines
the
words
had
hardly
been
uttered
when
above
the
brickwork
appeared
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
boy
a
size
or
so
bigger
than
acton
a
brown
bowler
hat
was
stuck
on
the
very
back
of
his
head
and
rammed
down
until
the
brim
rested
on
the
top
of
his
ears
and
it
will
be
quite
sufficient
to
remark
that
his
face
was
in
exact
keeping
with
the
manner
in
which
he
wore
his
hat
once
more
everybody
gave
vent
to
their
feelings
by
another
involuntary
ejaculation
young
noaks
the
stranger
laughed
pulled
a
face
which
as
far
as
ugliness
went
was
hardly
an
improvement
on
the
one
nature
had
already
bestowed
upon
him
and
then
pointed
mockingly
at
the
remains
of
the
masterpiece
his
triumph
however
was
jack
vance
as
he
left
the
house
had
caught
up
a
double
handful
of
snow
which
he
had
been
pressing
into
a
hard
ball
as
he
ran
down
the
path
determining
in
his
own
mind
to
be
the
first
to
open
fire
on
the
snow
man
without
a
moment
hesitation
he
flung
the
missile
at
the
intruder
head
and
to
the
intense
delight
of
his
companions
it
struck
the
latter
fairly
on
the
mouth
causing
him
to
lose
his
precarious
foothold
on
the
wall
and
fall
back
into
the
road
it
needed
no
further
warning
to
inform
the
birchites
that
the
philistines
were
upon
them
and
every
one
set
to
work
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
snowballs
as
fast
as
hands
could
make
them
look
out
cried
kennedy
young
noaks
face
rose
once
more
above
the
top
of
the
wall
and
the
next
moment
a
big
stone
the
size
of
hen
egg
whizzed
past
diggory
head
and
struck
the
garden
door
with
a
sounding
bang
oh
the
cad
cried
acton
let
go
for
him
the
whole
garrison
combined
in
making
a
vigorous
sortie
into
the
road
but
it
was
only
to
find
the
enemy
in
full
retreat
and
a
few
dropping
shots
at
long
range
ended
the
skirmish
i
say
vance
exclaimed
diggory
who
are
they
who
are
these
fellows
now
as
the
aforesaid
philistines
play
rather
an
important
part
in
the
opening
chapters
of
our
story
i
propose
to
answer
the
question
myself
in
such
a
way
that
the
reader
may
be
enabled
to
take
a
more
intelligent
interest
in
the
chain
of
events
which
commenced
with
the
destruction
of
the
snow
man
and
in
order
that
this
may
be
done
in
a
satisfactory
manner
i
will
in
a
few
words
map
out
the
ground
on
which
this
memorable
campaign
was
afterwards
conducted
take
the
drawing
of
two
right
angles
in
euclid
definition
and
imagine
the
horizontal
line
to
be
the
main
road
to
chatford
while
the
perpendicular
one
standing
on
it
is
a
called
locker
lane
in
the
right
angle
stood
the
birches
the
house
itself
faced
the
chatford
road
while
behind
it
in
regular
succession
came
first
the
sloping
garden
then
the
playground
and
then
the
small
field
in
which
were
attempted
such
games
of
cricket
and
football
as
the
limited
number
of
pupils
would
permit
there
were
three
doors
in
the
playground
one
the
entrance
from
the
garden
another
opening
into
the
lane
and
a
third
into
the
field
the
two
latter
being
usually
kept
locked
locker
lane
was
a
short
cut
to
chatford
yet
rule
in
the
birches
ordained
that
no
boy
should
either
go
or
return
by
this
route
when
visiting
the
town
the
whole
road
was
practically
put
out
of
bounds
and
the
reason
for
this
regulation
was
as
follows
at
the
corner
of
the
playing
field
the
lane
took
a
sharp
turn
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
beyond
this
stood
a
large
house
shut
in
on
three
sides
by
a
high
wall
whereon
close
to
the
heavy
double
doors
which
formed
the
entrance
appeared
a
board
bearing
in
big
letters
the
legend
horace
house
school
for
boys
phillips
the
pupils
of
phillips
had
been
formerly
called
by
welsby
boys
the
phillipians
which
title
had
in
time
given
place
to
the
present
nickname
of
the
philistines
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
average
boy
turned
out
by
horace
house
was
as
good
a
fellow
taking
him
all
round
as
the
average
boy
produced
by
the
birches
and
that
if
they
had
been
thrown
together
in
one
school
they
would
for
the
most
part
have
made
very
good
friends
and
comrades
however
in
fairness
both
to
them
and
to
their
rivals
it
must
be
said
that
at
the
period
of
our
story
phillips
seemed
for
some
time
past
to
have
been
unusually
unfortunate
in
his
elder
boys
they
were
undoubtedly
cads
and
the
character
of
the
whole
establishment
as
far
as
the
scholars
were
concerned
naturally
yielded
to
the
influence
of
its
leaders
it
had
been
customary
every
term
for
the
birchites
to
play
a
match
against
them
either
at
cricket
or
football
but
their
conduct
during
a
visit
paid
to
the
ground
of
the
latter
back
in
the
previous
summer
had
been
so
very
ungentlemanly
and
unsportsmanlike
that
when
the
next
challenge
arrived
for
an
encounter
at
football
welsby
wrote
back
a
polite
note
expressing
regret
that
he
did
not
see
his
way
clear
to
permit
a
continuation
of
the
matches
this
was
the
signal
for
an
outbreak
of
open
hostilities
between
the
two
schools
the
philistines
charged
the
birchites
in
the
open
street
with
being
afraid
to
meet
them
in
the
field
these
base
insinuations
led
to
frequent
exchanges
of
taunts
and
uncomplimentary
remarks
and
last
of
all
matters
were
brought
to
a
climax
by
a
fight
between
tom
mason
predecessor
as
dux
and
young
noaks
the
encounter
took
place
just
outside
the
stronghold
of
the
enemy
the
birchite
so
far
getting
the
best
of
it
that
at
the
end
of
a
five
minutes
engagement
he
proclaimed
his
victory
by
dragging
his
adversary
along
by
the
collar
and
bumping
his
head
a
number
of
times
against
the
very
gates
of
horace
house
unfortunately
a
rumour
of
what
had
happened
got
to
the
ears
of
welsby
mason
was
severely
reprimanded
and
his
companions
were
forbidden
under
pain
of
heavy
punishment
to
walk
in
locker
lane
further
than
the
corner
of
their
own
playing
field
but
who
is
young
noaks
asked
diggory
as
jack
vance
finished
a
hasty
account
of
this
warfare
with
the
philistines
why
that
just
the
funny
part
of
it
returned
the
other
this
sam
noaks
is
the
son
of
our
noaks
but
he
got
an
uncle
called
simpson
who
lives
at
todderton
where
i
come
from
this
man
simpson
made
a
lot
of
money
out
in
australia
and
when
he
came
back
to
england
he
adopted
young
noaks
and
sends
him
here
to
phillips
school
by
this
time
the
home
forces
had
all
struggled
back
into
the
playground
in
one
corner
stood
a
wooden
shed
containing
a
carpenter
bench
a
chest
for
bats
and
stumps
and
various
other
things
belonging
to
different
boys
acton
as
head
of
the
school
kept
the
key
and
having
unfastened
the
door
summoned
his
followers
inside
to
hold
an
impromptu
council
of
war
and
discuss
the
situation
there
was
a
grave
expression
on
each
face
for
every
one
felt
that
things
were
beginning
to
look
serious
mason
the
only
one
of
their
number
who
had
been
physically
equal
to
the
leaders
of
their
opponents
was
no
longer
among
them
and
the
enemy
evidently
aware
of
their
helpless
condition
had
dared
for
the
first
time
to
actually
come
and
beard
them
in
their
own
den
what
i
want
to
know
first
is
this
began
acton
you
can
see
by
the
footmarks
that
they
came
in
through
that
door
of
course
it
always
kept
locked
and
here
the
key
hanging
up
inside
the
shed
now
who
opened
it
for
them
and
how
was
it
done
perhaps
it
was
fastened
suggested
morris
yes
it
was
answered
kennedy
excitedly
i
noticed
that
this
morning
when
we
were
picking
up
stones
for
the
snow
man
buttons
then
i
tell
you
what
it
is
continued
acton
solemnly
some
one
playing
us
false
and
my
belief
is
it
old
noaks
remember
last
term
when
mason
and
jack
vance
and
i
made
a
plot
for
going
down
and
throwing
crackers
into
their
yard
well
they
must
have
heard
of
it
from
some
one
for
they
were
all
lying
in
wait
for
us
behind
the
wall
and
as
soon
as
we
got
near
to
it
they
threw
cans
of
water
over
us
and
pelted
us
with
stones
there
was
a
murmur
of
suppressed
wrath
at
the
memory
of
the
fate
of
this
gallant
expedition
yes
added
shaw
and
i
believe
some
one
told
them
about
this
snow
man
well
one
thing
certain
said
acton
we
must
serve
out
somehow
for
knocking
it
down
they
evidently
think
now
mason
gone
they
can
do
what
they
like
and
that
we
shall
be
afraid
of
them
now
what
can
we
do
there
was
a
silence
every
one
felt
that
a
serious
crisis
had
arrived
in
the
history
of
the
birchites
and
that
unless
some
immediate
steps
were
taken
to
avenge
this
insult
they
would
no
longer
be
free
men
but
live
in
constant
terror
of
the
philistines
every
one
i
say
felt
that
some
bold
action
must
be
taken
yet
nobody
had
a
suggestion
to
make
well
look
here
said
acton
something
got
to
be
done
we
must
all
think
it
over
and
we
have
another
meeting
in
a
week
time
then
if
any
one
made
a
plan
we
talk
it
over
and
decide
what
to
be
done
jack
said
diggory
two
evenings
later
you
know
what
acton
said
about
the
philistines
well
i
got
part
of
a
plan
in
my
head
but
i
tell
you
what
it
is
till
wednesday
chapter
iii
discomfiture
of
the
philistines
on
wednesday
afternoon
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
acton
summoned
his
followers
to
attend
the
council
of
war
which
was
to
decide
what
reprisals
should
be
taken
on
the
philistines
for
the
destruction
of
the
snow
man
every
one
felt
the
importance
of
a
for
unless
something
of
the
kind
were
attempted
as
acton
remarked
in
his
opening
speech
they
think
we
funky
of
them
and
they
simply
come
down
here
as
often
as
they
like
and
worry
us
to
death
could
we
tell
mr
welsby
suggested
butler
a
timid
small
boy
belonging
to
the
dogs
home
tell
mr
welsby
cried
half
a
dozen
voices
in
withering
tones
of
course
not
it
was
well
known
by
both
parties
that
whenever
the
real
state
of
affairs
became
known
to
their
respective
the
war
would
come
to
an
abrupt
termination
and
the
great
reason
why
each
side
forbore
to
make
any
open
complaint
against
the
other
was
undoubtedly
because
every
one
secretly
enjoyed
the
excitement
of
the
campaign
and
felt
that
a
peace
would
make
life
rather
dull
and
uninteresting
the
thing
that
licks
us
said
acton
is
what
i
was
speaking
about
last
week
somehow
or
other
they
always
seem
to
know
just
what
we
up
to
and
it
no
use
our
doing
anything
because
they
always
prepared
some
one
acting
the
spy
i
ca
think
it
any
of
you
fellows
but
i
believe
it
old
noaks
you
see
his
son
there
and
for
some
reason
or
other
he
seems
to
hate
every
one
here
like
poison
now
what
are
we
to
do
there
was
a
silence
broken
at
length
by
diggory
trevanock
i
do
know
what
you
think
he
began
but
it
seems
to
me
it
no
use
making
any
plans
until
we
find
out
who
tells
to
the
philistines
i
should
say
that
noaks
is
the
fellow
who
does
it
but
we
ought
to
make
certain
yes
but
how
are
we
to
do
it
asked
acton
laughing
that
just
what
i
want
to
know
well
i
got
a
bit
of
a
plan
returned
the
other
only
i
should
like
to
tell
it
you
in
private
all
right
answered
the
dux
come
on
outside
now
then
what
is
it
why
said
diggory
it
this
i
did
want
the
other
chaps
to
hear
because
then
it
prove
who
the
spy
you
say
the
last
time
you
went
down
to
throw
some
crackers
over
the
wall
they
were
all
lying
in
wait
for
you
well
let
you
and
me
go
into
the
when
noaks
is
at
work
there
and
pretend
to
make
a
plan
as
though
we
were
going
to
do
it
again
night
then
two
of
us
might
go
down
and
see
if
prepared
if
so
it
must
have
been
noaks
who
told
them
because
no
one
else
knows
about
it
i
go
for
one
and
jack
vance
go
for
another
i
tell
him
to
keep
it
dark
and
you
can
let
us
in
and
out
of
the
door
oh
ah
said
acton
that
is
a
bad
idea
at
all
events
we
try
it
the
project
was
put
into
immediate
execution
that
same
afternoon
just
before
tea
acton
and
diggory
discussed
the
bogus
plan
in
hearing
while
jack
vance
having
been
admitted
into
their
confidence
and
sworn
to
secrecy
willingly
agreed
to
go
out
with
diggory
and
form
the
reconnoitering
party
which
was
to
report
on
the
movements
of
the
enemy
i
knew
you
come
said
the
latter
and
we
show
them
what
sort
of
stuff
the
triple
alliance
is
made
of
on
the
following
evening
as
soon
as
tea
was
over
the
two
friends
slipped
off
down
into
the
playground
where
they
were
joined
a
minute
later
by
acton
who
unlocking
the
shed
took
down
from
the
peg
on
which
it
hung
the
key
of
the
door
in
the
outer
wall
you
have
plenty
of
time
he
said
glancing
at
his
watch
and
with
this
moonlight
you
soon
be
able
to
see
if
they
about
i
keep
the
door
and
let
you
in
when
you
come
back
the
next
moment
the
two
members
of
the
alliance
were
trotting
down
locker
lane
it
was
a
bright
frosty
night
and
the
hard
ground
rang
beneath
their
feet
like
stone
they
turned
off
on
to
the
grass
lest
the
noise
should
give
the
enemy
warning
of
their
approach
and
when
within
about
a
hundred
yards
of
horace
house
pulled
up
to
consider
for
a
moment
what
their
plan
of
action
should
be
before
proceeding
any
further
i
do
see
any
one
said
jack
vance
perhaps
they
are
hiding
answered
diggory
look
here
let
get
into
this
field
and
run
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
until
we
get
opposite
the
gate
the
stronghold
of
the
philistines
was
silent
as
the
grave
the
two
chums
crouched
behind
a
thick
bush
and
peering
through
its
leafless
branches
could
see
nothing
but
the
closed
double
doors
and
a
stretch
of
blank
wall
on
either
side
there
no
one
about
whispered
vance
i
do
believe
old
noaks
has
told
them
wait
a
minute
answered
diggory
i
see
if
i
can
stir
any
of
them
and
so
saying
he
knelt
up
and
cried
in
an
audible
voice
now
then
are
you
all
ready
diggory
and
jack
vance
dropped
flat
on
their
stomachs
for
the
words
had
hardly
been
uttered
when
the
doors
were
flung
open
and
at
least
ten
of
the
philistines
rushed
out
into
the
road
with
a
yell
of
defiance
many
of
them
were
bigger
than
acton
and
what
would
have
been
the
fate
of
the
two
birchites
had
they
kept
to
the
road
instead
of
acting
on
diggory
suggestion
of
advancing
under
cover
of
the
hedge
one
hardly
dares
to
imagine
hullo
cried
young
noaks
who
had
headed
the
sortie
there
nobody
here
and
yet
i
swear
i
heard
them
somewhere
so
did
i
answered
another
voice
they
must
have
cut
and
run
there
no
place
for
them
to
run
to
returned
noaks
they
must
be
behind
that
come
out
of
it
you
skunks
a
big
stone
came
crashing
through
the
twigs
within
a
yard
of
head
the
two
boys
crouched
close
to
the
low
earth
bank
and
held
their
breath
they
must
be
about
somewhere
cried
noaks
i
knew
they
were
coming
and
i
sure
i
heard
some
one
say
you
ready
they
behind
that
hedge
we
ca
get
through
it
too
thick
but
you
fellows
stop
here
and
i
and
hogson
and
bernard
run
down
to
the
gate
and
cut
off
their
retreat
what
shall
we
do
whispered
jack
this
field
so
large
they
run
us
down
before
we
get
to
the
other
hedge
shall
we
make
a
bolt
and
chance
it
diggory
was
just
about
to
reply
in
the
affirmative
when
help
came
from
an
unexpected
quarter
what
are
you
boys
doing
out
here
at
this
time
cried
a
loud
stern
noaks
what
are
you
about
down
the
road
there
come
in
this
moment
every
one
of
you
saved
whispered
jack
vance
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
as
the
philistines
trooped
back
through
the
double
doors
that
was
old
phillips
i
hope
he
gives
noaks
a
jolly
good
that
chap
is
a
cad
continued
the
speaker
as
they
hurried
back
towards
the
birches
when
he
ca
do
anything
else
he
chucks
stones
like
he
did
the
wonder
is
he
has
killed
some
one
before
now
i
do
see
how
it
possible
for
the
philistines
to
show
up
well
when
they
got
a
chap
like
him
bossing
the
show
the
bell
for
evening
preparation
was
ringing
as
they
reached
the
birches
and
only
a
very
few
hasty
replies
could
be
given
to
eager
inquiries
as
they
rushed
together
up
the
garden
path
in
the
little
interval
before
supper
however
the
subject
was
resumed
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
passage
so
it
must
have
been
old
noaks
who
told
them
said
acton
proved
without
a
doubt
i
vote
we
go
and
have
a
jolly
row
with
him
morning
no
i
should
do
that
answered
diggory
do
let
him
know
that
we
found
him
out
well
look
here
answered
acton
thumping
the
wall
with
his
fist
and
frowning
heavily
what
are
we
going
to
do
to
get
even
with
the
philistines
we
ca
go
out
and
fight
them
in
locker
lane
we
too
small
and
they
know
it
young
noaks
would
never
have
dared
to
act
as
he
did
after
they
knocked
our
snow
man
down
if
mason
had
been
here
they
think
now
they
going
to
ride
over
us
but
they
are
and
we
must
show
them
we
are
going
to
be
trampled
on
so
we
will
cried
jack
vance
excitedly
and
that
jolly
quick
but
how
there
was
a
moment
pause
i
sure
i
do
know
answered
jack
sadly
and
so
the
meeting
terminated
the
fact
of
the
insult
which
had
been
put
upon
them
by
the
destruction
of
their
snow
man
remaining
unavenged
caused
a
sense
of
gloom
to
rest
upon
the
birchites
as
though
they
already
felt
themselves
suffering
beneath
the
yoke
of
the
conquering
philistines
even
the
bedroom
feuds
were
forgotten
night
after
night
the
house
of
lords
left
the
dogs
home
in
undisturbed
tranquillity
and
the
occupants
of
the
retired
to
rest
without
even
putting
a
washstand
against
their
door
one
thought
occupied
the
minds
of
all
and
even
mugford
when
asked
on
one
occasion
by
blake
who
were
the
conspirators
in
the
gunpowder
plot
answered
the
philistines
look
here
you
two
said
diggory
one
evening
as
he
scrambled
into
bed
we
three
must
think
of
some
way
of
paying
those
fellows
out
for
knocking
down
our
snow
man
it
would
be
splendid
if
we
could
say
that
the
triple
alliance
had
done
it
and
without
telling
any
one
beforehand
so
we
will
answered
jack
vance
that
is
if
you
think
of
the
plan
i
not
able
to
make
one
and
i
jolly
sure
mugford
ca
the
speaker
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
but
after
what
seemed
half
the
night
had
passed
he
was
suddenly
aroused
by
several
violent
tugs
at
his
thinking
it
nothing
less
than
a
midnight
raid
jack
sprang
up
and
grasped
his
pillow
no
no
it
not
that
said
diggory
but
i
wanted
to
help
you
i
got
an
idea
w
what
about
asked
the
other
in
a
sleepy
voice
why
how
we
can
pay
out
the
philistines
oh
bother
the
philistines
grumbled
jack
and
promptly
returned
to
the
land
of
dreams
i
wonder
where
those
fellows
vance
and
trevanock
are
said
acton
the
following
afternoon
as
the
boys
were
picking
up
for
a
game
at
prisoner
base
and
there
that
dummy
of
a
mugford
where
he
sneaked
off
to
he
never
will
play
games
if
he
can
possibly
help
it
they
set
to
work
and
at
the
end
of
about
twenty
minutes
were
engaged
in
a
most
exciting
rally
acton
had
started
out
to
rescue
one
of
the
prisoners
while
shaw
had
rushed
forth
to
capture
acton
morris
left
the
base
with
similar
designs
on
shaw
and
every
one
with
the
exception
of
the
seemed
suddenly
seized
with
an
irresistible
desire
to
do
something
the
playground
was
full
of
boys
rushing
and
dodging
all
over
the
place
when
suddenly
everybody
stood
still
and
listened
some
one
was
pounding
with
his
clinched
fist
at
the
door
opening
into
locker
lane
and
at
the
same
time
jack
vance
was
heard
shouting
let
us
in
quick
or
the
philistines
have
us
acton
ran
to
fetch
the
key
and
the
next
moment
the
three
members
of
the
triple
alliance
dashed
through
the
open
door
which
was
hastily
secured
behind
them
while
a
shout
of
baffled
rage
some
little
distance
down
the
road
showed
that
they
had
only
narrowly
escaped
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
the
pursuit
however
was
evidently
abandoned
and
morris
climbing
on
the
roof
of
the
shed
saw
young
noaks
and
hogson
slowly
retreating
round
the
corner
of
the
road
the
three
friends
certainly
presented
a
striking
appearance
nose
was
bleeding
jack
vance
collar
seemed
to
have
been
nearly
torn
off
his
neck
while
diggory
cap
was
in
his
hand
and
his
hair
in
a
state
of
wild
disorder
their
faces
flushed
with
running
were
radiant
with
a
look
of
triumph
while
all
three
the
unfortunate
mugford
included
leaned
up
against
the
wall
and
laughed
until
the
tears
ran
down
their
cheeks
what
have
you
fellows
been
up
to
cried
acton
why
do
you
tell
us
oh
my
gasped
diggory
we
taken
a
fine
rise
out
of
the
philistines
they
ca
say
we
not
quits
with
them
now
and
he
went
off
into
a
fresh
fit
of
merriment
shaw
and
morris
seized
hold
of
jack
vance
and
at
length
succeeded
in
shaking
him
into
a
sufficient
state
of
sobriety
to
be
able
to
answer
their
questions
oh
dear
he
said
faintly
i
never
laughed
so
much
in
my
life
before
diggory
ought
to
tell
you
because
he
planned
it
all
we
went
very
quietly
down
to
horace
house
and
found
the
double
doors
were
shut
you
know
just
what
they
like
how
the
wall
curves
in
a
bit
and
there
a
scraper
close
to
the
on
either
side
about
a
foot
from
the
ground
we
got
an
old
cord
with
us
and
we
tied
it
to
each
of
the
scrapers
the
doors
have
a
sort
of
iron
ring
for
a
handle
and
through
this
we
stuck
a
broken
and
mug
and
i
held
the
two
ends
so
that
you
could
possibly
lift
the
latch
on
the
inside
then
but
you
go
on
diggy
well
then
continued
the
other
i
scrambled
on
to
these
two
shoulders
and
looked
over
the
top
of
the
door
we
could
hear
some
of
the
philistines
knocking
about
on
the
gravel
and
i
saw
there
were
about
half
a
dozen
of
them
playing
footer
with
a
i
shouted
out
they
all
stood
still
in
a
moment
and
young
noaks
cried
it
a
birchite
what
do
you
want
here
you
young
dog
i
could
think
of
anything
else
to
say
so
i
said
want
to
know
if
this
is
the
or
the
my
eye
you
should
have
seen
them
i
dropped
down
in
a
trice
and
they
all
rushed
to
the
doors
but
they
could
lift
the
latch
because
mug
and
jack
were
holding
fast
to
the
stump
we
waited
a
moment
and
then
let
go
and
ran
for
it
you
may
judge
what
happened
next
it
a
regular
sea
of
mud
outside
those
gates
they
all
came
rushing
out
together
and
i
saw
noaks
and
hogson
go
head
first
over
the
rope
and
two
or
three
others
fall
flat
on
the
top
of
them
it
was
a
sight
i
can
tell
you
yes
but
that
was
all
interrupted
jack
vance
bernard
one
of
their
big
chaps
hopped
over
the
rest
and
came
after
us
we
ran
for
all
we
were
worth
but
he
collared
me
mugford
went
for
him
and
hung
on
to
his
coat
like
a
young
and
got
a
smack
on
the
nose
and
just
then
diggory
turned
and
came
prancing
back
and
ran
his
head
into
the
beggar
stomach
and
that
doubled
him
up
and
so
we
all
got
away
but
concluded
the
speaker
turning
towards
his
wounded
comrade
i
never
thought
old
mug
had
so
much
grit
in
him
before
he
stuck
to
it
like
a
briton
a
demonstration
of
the
most
genuine
enthusiasm
followed
this
warlike
speech
acton
folded
diggory
to
his
breast
in
a
loving
embrace
shaw
and
morris
stuffed
the
down
mugford
back
while
the
remainder
of
the
company
executed
a
round
jack
vance
my
eye
cried
the
dux
wo
the
philistines
be
wild
fancy
upsetting
them
in
the
mud
and
knocking
bernard
wind
out
they
wo
be
in
a
hurry
to
meddle
with
us
again
well
done
diggy
it
was
i
alone
said
the
author
of
the
enterprise
we
did
it
between
us
the
triple
alliance
then
three
cheers
for
the
triple
alliance
cried
acton
the
company
shouted
themselves
hoarse
for
every
one
felt
that
the
honour
of
the
birches
had
been
retrieved
and
that
the
day
was
still
far
distant
when
they
would
be
crushed
beneath
the
iron
heel
of
young
noaks
or
be
exposed
as
an
unresisting
prey
to
the
ravages
of
the
wild
hordes
of
horace
house
chapter
iv
the
supper
club
as
this
story
is
to
be
a
history
of
the
triple
alliance
and
not
of
the
birches
it
will
be
necessary
to
pass
over
many
things
which
happened
at
the
preparatory
school
in
order
that
full
justice
may
be
done
to
the
important
parts
played
by
our
three
friends
in
an
epoch
of
strange
and
stirring
events
at
ronleigh
college
diggory
by
the
daring
exploit
described
in
the
previous
chapter
won
all
hearts
and
instead
of
being
looked
upon
as
a
new
boy
was
regarded
quite
as
an
old
and
trusty
comrade
acton
displayed
marked
favour
towards
the
triple
alliance
and
was
even
more
friendly
with
diggory
and
jack
vance
than
with
his
room
and
class
mates
shaw
and
morris
the
philistines
seemed
for
the
time
being
paralyzed
by
the
humiliation
of
their
mud
bath
and
for
many
months
there
was
a
complete
cessation
from
hostilities
it
was
perhaps
only
natural
that
in
time
of
peace
a
brave
knight
like
acton
should
turn
his
thoughts
from
war
to
and
therefore
i
shall
make
no
excuse
for
relating
a
little
experience
of
his
which
must
be
introduced
as
a
prelude
to
the
account
of
the
formation
of
the
famous
supper
club
at
the
very
commencement
of
the
summer
term
it
was
plain
to
everybody
that
something
was
wrong
with
the
dux
he
seemed
to
take
no
interest
in
the
doings
of
his
companions
in
the
playground
and
only
once
roused
himself
sufficiently
to
bang
cross
with
a
for
bowling
awful
wides
at
cricket
at
length
one
afternoon
diggory
and
jack
vance
on
entering
the
shed
found
him
sitting
on
the
carpenter
bench
with
his
chin
resting
in
his
hand
and
a
most
ferocious
expression
on
his
face
hullo
what
up
acton
stared
blankly
at
the
until
the
question
had
been
repeated
then
he
sat
up
and
straightened
his
back
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
made
a
great
resolve
i
do
mind
telling
you
two
he
said
you
know
i
said
before
that
i
meant
some
day
to
propose
to
miss
eleanor
well
he
added
stabbing
the
bench
with
the
gimlet
i
going
to
do
it
i
saved
five
and
ninepence
continued
the
speaker
to
buy
a
ring
with
but
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
whether
i
better
speak
or
write
to
her
what
do
you
think
i
should
say
answered
diggory
after
a
moment
thought
that
the
best
thing
would
be
to
toss
up
for
it
all
right
have
you
got
a
coin
no
but
i
think
i
got
a
brass
button
yes
here
it
is
now
then
front
you
speak
and
back
you
write
there
you
are
it
a
letter
well
now
said
acton
getting
off
the
bench
and
sticking
his
hands
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
what
had
i
better
say
i
shall
be
fifteen
in
august
i
thought
i
tell
her
my
age
and
say
i
did
mind
waiting
i
believe
it
the
girl
who
always
says
that
answered
jack
vance
kicking
a
bit
of
wood
into
a
corner
then
again
i
do
know
how
to
begin
would
you
say
miss
eleanor
or
miss
welsby
i
think
eleanor
sounds
rather
cheeky
i
tell
you
what
i
should
do
answered
diggory
who
seemed
to
have
a
great
idea
of
letting
the
fates
decide
these
matters
i
should
write
all
three
on
slips
of
paper
and
then
draw
one
well
i
going
to
write
the
letter
in
this
evening
and
let
her
have
it
did
you
notice
i
gave
her
a
flower
this
morning
and
she
stuck
it
in
her
dress
yes
but
fellows
are
often
doing
that
answered
jack
vance
and
she
always
wears
them
either
in
her
dress
or
stuck
up
somehow
under
her
brooch
oh
but
this
was
a
white
rose
and
a
white
rose
means
something
though
i
do
know
what
at
all
events
she
have
the
letter
and
i
tell
you
fellows
when
i
give
it
her
only
of
course
you
breathe
a
word
to
any
one
else
all
right
we
wo
answered
diggory
except
to
old
mugford
because
he
one
of
the
alliance
and
we
sworn
not
to
have
any
secrets
from
each
other
and
he
wo
split
that
evening
the
triple
alliance
lay
awake
until
a
late
hour
discussing
the
situation
mugford
opening
comment
was
certainly
worth
recording
i
hope
she
accept
him
why
why
because
if
she
does
i
should
think
old
welsby
give
us
a
it
was
evident
at
breakfast
to
those
who
were
in
the
know
that
acton
was
prepared
for
the
venture
he
was
wearing
a
clean
collar
and
new
necktie
and
ate
only
four
pieces
of
bread
and
butter
besides
his
bacon
he
shown
me
the
letter
whispered
diggory
to
jack
vance
only
i
promised
i
would
say
what
was
in
it
but
it
ends
up
with
a
piece
of
poetry
as
long
as
this
table
after
morning
school
was
the
time
agreed
upon
for
the
dux
to
cast
the
die
which
was
to
decide
his
future
and
as
soon
as
the
classes
were
dismissed
jack
vance
and
diggory
met
him
by
appointment
in
one
corner
of
the
garden
i
done
it
he
said
looking
awfully
solemn
she
was
in
the
hall
and
i
gave
it
to
her
as
i
came
out
i
say
how
many
are
there
in
jack
vance
thought
one
diggory
said
two
and
the
company
then
relapsed
into
silence
and
stood
with
gloomy
looks
upon
their
faces
as
though
they
were
waiting
to
take
part
in
a
funeral
procession
at
length
a
voice
from
the
house
was
heard
calling
fred
fred
acton
the
dux
turned
a
trifle
pale
but
pulling
himself
together
marched
off
with
a
firm
step
to
learn
his
fate
she
called
him
fred
murmured
diggory
that
sounds
hopeful
oh
that
nothing
answered
jack
vance
miss
eleanor
always
calls
fellows
by
their
christian
names
there
one
thing
he
added
after
a
few
moments
thought
if
she
cut
up
rough
over
the
letter
she
might
have
called
him
acton
hullo
here
he
comes
as
he
spoke
acton
emerged
from
the
house
and
came
down
the
path
towards
them
his
straw
hat
was
tilted
forward
over
his
eyes
and
his
cheeks
were
glowing
like
the
red
glass
of
a
lamp
he
sauntered
along
kicking
up
the
gravel
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
well
what
happened
inquired
jack
vance
no
answer
what
the
matter
cried
diggory
what
did
she
say
why
this
answered
the
other
in
a
voice
trembling
with
suppressed
emotion
she
said
i
was
a
silly
boy
and
and
me
a
lump
of
cake
if
any
one
else
had
done
it
the
probability
is
acton
would
have
slain
them
on
the
spot
diggory
opened
his
eyes
and
mouth
wide
and
then
exploded
with
laughter
oh
my
he
gasped
i
shall
die
i
know
i
shall
ha
ha
ha
acton
eyed
him
for
a
moment
with
a
look
of
indignant
astonishment
then
he
began
to
smile
jack
vance
commenced
to
chuckle
and
very
soon
all
three
were
laughing
in
concert
well
i
think
it
rather
unfeeling
of
you
fellows
said
the
rejected
suitor
i
can
tell
you
i
jolly
cut
up
about
it
i
awfully
sorry
answered
diggory
but
i
could
help
laughing
cheer
up
why
think
you
wo
have
to
get
the
ring
now
so
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
that
five
and
ninepence
you
saved
why
it
worth
being
refused
to
have
five
and
ninepence
to
spend
in
grub
ah
diggy
said
the
other
shaking
his
head
in
a
mournful
manner
wait
till
you
as
old
as
i
am
when
you
close
on
fifteen
think
differently
about
love
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
as
has
already
been
hinted
it
was
the
failure
of
this
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
dux
to
win
the
heart
and
hand
of
miss
eleanor
that
indirectly
brought
about
the
formation
of
the
famous
supper
club
about
a
week
after
the
events
happened
which
have
just
been
described
acton
invited
the
triple
alliance
to
meet
the
house
of
lords
in
the
to
discuss
an
important
scheme
which
he
said
had
been
in
his
mind
for
some
days
past
and
the
door
having
been
locked
to
exclude
outsiders
he
commenced
to
unfold
his
project
as
follows
i
been
thinking
that
during
the
summer
term
and
while
the
warm
our
two
rooms
might
form
a
supper
club
we
hold
it
say
once
a
week
when
is
given
out
and
have
a
feed
together
one
time
in
your
room
and
the
next
in
ours
after
every
one
gone
to
bed
you
know
i
saved
some
money
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
to
buy
an
engagement
ring
with
but
i
do
want
it
now
so
i
going
to
spend
the
tin
in
grub
and
if
you
like
i
stand
the
first
feed
there
was
a
murmur
expressive
of
approbation
at
this
generous
offer
mingled
with
sympathy
for
the
unhappy
circumstance
which
gave
rise
to
it
and
which
was
now
an
open
secret
oh
said
shaw
that
a
grand
idea
i
know
my
brother
bob
who
at
a
big
school
at
lingmouth
told
me
that
he
and
some
other
chaps
formed
a
supper
club
and
held
it
in
his
study
it
by
the
sea
and
they
used
to
go
out
and
catch
shrimps
and
they
only
had
one
old
that
they
used
to
boil
over
the
gas
so
they
cooked
the
shrimps
in
it
first
and
made
the
coffee
after
one
night
they
only
had
time
to
heat
it
up
once
and
so
they
boiled
the
shrimps
in
the
coffee
and
bob
says
they
did
taste
half
bad
and
that
they
always
used
to
do
it
after
to
save
time
well
i
propose
that
we
have
one
cried
morris
the
resolution
was
carried
unanimously
acton
was
elected
president
and
by
way
of
recognizing
the
mutual
interest
of
the
triple
alliance
jack
vance
was
appointed
to
act
as
secretary
and
it
was
decided
to
hold
the
first
banquet
on
the
following
night
we
can
buy
the
grub
said
acton
but
there
one
thing
we
ought
to
fetch
and
that
is
i
thought
we
might
have
say
six
bottles
of
then
each
man
must
take
his
own
up
to
bed
with
him
this
evening
and
hide
it
away
in
his
box
or
in
one
of
his
drawers
this
was
accordingly
done
and
as
it
happened
was
the
cause
of
the
only
disaster
which
attended
the
formation
of
the
club
for
the
first
week
in
june
the
weather
was
unusually
hot
a
candle
left
all
day
in
the
was
found
drooping
out
of
the
perpendicular
and
when
the
triple
alliance
retired
to
rest
their
bedroom
felt
like
an
oven
they
were
just
dozing
off
to
sleep
when
all
three
were
suddenly
startled
by
a
muffled
bang
somewhere
close
to
them
in
an
instant
they
were
sitting
up
in
bed
rubbing
their
eyes
with
one
hand
and
grasping
their
pillows
with
the
other
look
out
they
coming
whispered
jack
vance
was
that
something
hit
the
door
it
sounded
as
if
something
fell
on
the
floor
answered
diggory
i
wonder
if
anything
rolled
off
either
of
the
washstands
jack
vance
reconnoitred
the
passage
while
diggory
and
mugford
examined
the
room
but
nothing
could
be
found
to
account
for
the
disturbance
it
must
have
been
the
fellows
in
the
i
expect
they
dropped
a
book
or
upset
a
chair
do
let
bother
about
it
any
more
the
following
morning
however
the
mystery
was
explained
the
boys
were
hastily
putting
on
their
clothes
when
mugford
who
had
just
thrown
aside
a
dirty
collar
gave
vent
to
an
exclamation
of
dismay
which
attracted
the
attention
of
his
two
companions
hullo
what
up
why
look
here
if
this
beastly
bottle
of
has
gone
and
burst
in
the
middle
of
my
box
the
first
meeting
of
the
supper
club
was
a
great
success
how
ever
acton
and
his
noble
friends
had
managed
to
smuggle
upstairs
under
their
jackets
a
a
a
bag
of
tarts
and
a
pound
of
biscuits
was
a
feat
which
as
jack
vance
remarked
beat
conjuring
shortly
after
midnight
the
triple
alliance
wended
their
way
to
the
house
of
lords
where
they
found
the
three
other
members
quite
ready
to
commence
operations
the
good
things
were
spread
out
on
the
top
of
a
chest
of
drawers
and
the
company
ranged
themselves
round
on
the
available
chairs
and
two
adjacent
beds
and
commenced
to
enjoy
the
repast
ah
well
sighed
acton
with
his
mouth
full
of
i
rather
glad
for
some
things
that
i
did
get
engaged
it
must
be
rather
a
bore
having
to
spend
all
your
money
in
rings
and
that
sort
of
thing
instead
of
in
grub
though
i
really
think
i
have
given
up
grub
for
miss
eleanor
i
wonder
said
morris
who
was
of
a
more
prosaic
disposition
how
it
is
that
it
always
much
jollier
having
a
feed
when
you
ought
not
to
than
at
the
proper
time
for
instance
eating
this
at
a
table
with
knife
and
fork
and
a
plate
would
be
a
quarter
the
fun
it
is
having
it
like
we
doing
now
cutting
it
with
a
razor
out
of
and
knowing
that
if
we
were
cobbed
we
should
get
into
a
jolly
row
talking
about
rows
over
feeds
said
acton
my
brother
john
is
at
ronleigh
college
and
i
remember
soon
after
he
went
there
he
said
they
had
a
great
spree
in
his
dormitory
one
of
the
chaps
had
had
a
hamper
sent
him
and
they
smuggled
the
grub
upstairs
and
when
they
thought
the
coast
was
clear
they
spread
a
sheet
on
the
floor
and
laid
out
the
grub
as
if
it
were
on
a
the
fellow
who
was
standing
treat
was
rather
a
swell
in
his
way
and
among
other
things
he
got
his
jam
put
out
in
a
flat
glass
dish
it
was
a
fine
feed
and
they
just
begun
when
they
heard
some
one
coming
they
only
just
got
time
to
turn
out
the
gas
and
jump
into
bed
before
the
door
opened
and
in
came
one
of
the
masters
called
weston
well
of
course
they
all
pretended
to
be
asleep
but
the
master
had
heard
them
scrambling
about
and
he
walked
in
the
dark
up
the
aisle
between
the
beds
saying
been
out
of
bed
here
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
stuck
his
foot
into
the
glass
and
it
slid
along
the
floor
and
down
he
came
bang
in
the
middle
of
all
the
spread
john
said
that
when
the
gas
was
lit
they
could
help
laughing
at
old
weston
he
rammed
one
elbow
into
a
box
of
sardines
and
there
was
a
stuck
in
the
middle
of
his
back
but
oh
there
was
a
row
i
can
tell
you
this
yarn
produced
others
and
the
time
passed
pleasantly
enough
until
full
justice
had
been
done
to
the
provisions
and
hardly
a
crumb
remained
phew
is
it
hot
said
diggory
let
open
the
window
a
bit
the
moon
must
be
full
he
continued
as
he
raised
the
sash
nearly
as
light
as
day
i
can
see
all
down
the
garden
and
hullo
quick
put
the
candle
out
every
one
started
to
his
feet
and
the
light
was
extinguished
in
a
moment
what
is
it
what
the
matter
they
all
asked
there
some
one
in
the
playground
whispered
diggory
as
the
others
crowded
round
him
you
see
the
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
well
just
when
i
spoke
some
one
opened
it
and
looked
up
at
the
house
and
then
shut
it
again
it
must
have
been
blake
and
he
seen
our
light
it
ca
be
blake
answered
acton
he
gone
to
fenley
to
play
in
a
cricket
match
and
is
coming
back
till
morning
old
welsby
went
to
bed
hours
ago
and
besides
what
should
either
of
them
want
to
be
doing
down
there
at
this
time
of
night
you
must
have
been
dreaming
diggy
no
i
was
i
saw
it
distinctly
it
must
be
old
blake
he
come
home
sooner
than
he
expected
and
i
should
wonder
if
he
going
round
by
the
road
to
take
us
by
surprise
he
ca
do
that
answered
acton
because
i
got
the
key
of
the
shed
and
the
hung
up
inside
acton
remained
watching
at
the
window
while
the
others
hastily
cleared
away
all
traces
of
the
feast
the
triple
alliance
retired
to
their
own
room
and
nothing
further
was
heard
or
seen
of
the
mysterious
visitor
the
next
morning
it
was
discovered
that
blake
had
not
returned
from
fenley
and
the
five
other
members
of
the
supper
club
were
inclined
to
regard
diggory
vision
of
the
midnight
intruder
as
a
sort
of
waking
nightmare
resulting
from
an
overdose
of
cake
and
two
days
later
cross
came
into
the
schoolroom
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
look
here
you
fellows
he
exclaimed
some
one
keeps
taking
away
my
things
out
of
the
shed
and
not
putting
them
back
last
week
i
missed
a
saw
and
two
chisels
and
now
that
brace
and
nearly
all
the
bits
are
gone
it
a
jolly
shame
carpentering
was
cross
great
hobby
and
his
collection
of
tools
was
an
exceptionally
good
one
both
as
regards
quantity
and
quality
every
one
however
denied
having
touched
the
things
mentioned
a
general
search
was
made
but
the
missing
articles
could
not
be
found
and
at
length
the
matter
was
reported
to
welsby
the
latter
was
evidently
greatly
displeased
on
hearing
the
facts
of
the
case
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
he
called
the
school
together
and
after
standing
for
some
moments
in
silence
frowning
at
the
book
he
carried
in
his
hand
said
briefly
with
regard
to
these
tools
there
is
a
word
which
has
never
been
used
before
in
connection
with
any
pupil
at
the
birches
and
which
i
hope
i
may
never
have
occasion
to
use
again
i
can
hardly
think
it
possible
that
we
have
a
in
the
house
i
am
rather
inclined
to
imagine
that
some
one
has
removed
the
things
and
hidden
them
away
in
joke
if
so
let
me
tell
him
that
the
joke
has
been
allowed
to
go
too
far
and
that
unless
they
are
returned
at
once
a
shadow
of
doubt
will
be
cast
upon
the
honour
and
integrity
of
all
here
present
it
is
impossible
for
such
large
articles
as
a
saw
and
a
brace
to
be
mislaid
or
lost
on
such
small
premises
as
these
and
i
trust
that
before
this
evening
you
will
report
to
me
that
the
things
have
been
found
i
have
purposely
allowed
the
key
of
the
shed
to
remain
in
your
own
possession
feeling
certain
that
your
behaviour
as
regards
each
other
property
would
be
in
accordance
with
the
treatment
which
one
gentleman
expects
to
receive
from
another
you
may
go
there
was
little
in
the
nature
of
a
scolding
in
this
address
and
yet
something
in
it
caused
every
one
to
leave
the
room
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
acton
and
jack
vance
especially
fairly
boiled
with
wrath
what
old
welsby
says
is
quite
right
remarked
the
latter
and
until
those
things
are
found
we
may
all
be
looked
upon
as
thieves
the
search
however
proved
fruitless
and
what
was
worse
in
turning
over
the
contents
of
the
shed
acton
discovered
that
a
lantern
belonging
to
himself
had
disappeared
from
the
shelf
on
which
it
usually
stood
while
mugford
declared
that
a
box
of
compasses
which
he
had
brought
down
a
few
days
before
to
draw
a
pattern
on
a
piece
of
board
was
also
missing
directly
after
tea
acton
diggory
and
taking
him
aside
said
look
here
i
in
an
awful
rage
about
these
thing
being
prigged
because
of
course
i
got
the
key
of
the
shed
and
you
hear
what
old
welsby
said
about
it
it
looks
uncommonly
as
if
i
were
the
thief
you
remember
what
you
said
the
other
night
when
we
had
that
feed
about
seeing
that
man
think
there
any
one
who
comes
here
at
night
and
steals
things
well
i
certain
i
saw
some
one
in
the
playground
when
i
told
you
it
was
a
man
but
whether
he
comes
regularly
and
goes
into
the
shed
i
do
know
but
i
think
we
ought
to
be
able
to
find
out
how
oh
some
way
or
other
i
tell
you
that
night
long
after
the
rest
of
the
house
were
asleep
the
triple
alliance
lay
awake
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
and
in
the
morning
as
the
boys
were
assembling
for
breakfast
diggory
touched
acton
on
the
shoulder
and
whispered
i
say
we
thought
of
a
plan
to
find
out
if
any
one
goes
into
the
shed
at
night
who
why
the
triple
alliance
we
thought
it
out
between
us
sneak
out
of
the
house
directly
after
evening
and
meet
me
in
the
playground
and
i
show
you
what
it
is
at
the
time
appointed
acton
ran
down
the
path
and
found
diggory
waiting
for
him
by
the
shed
look
said
the
latter
i
cut
a
little
tiny
slit
with
my
knife
in
each
about
three
feet
from
the
ground
and
i
going
to
stretch
this
piece
of
black
cotton
between
them
no
one
will
see
it
and
if
they
go
through
the
door
the
thread
will
simply
draw
out
of
one
of
the
slits
without
their
noticing
it
and
we
shall
see
that
it
been
disturbed
jack
vance
says
that
when
he
been
out
shooting
with
his
he
seen
the
keeper
put
them
across
the
paths
in
a
wood
to
find
out
if
poachers
have
been
up
them
now
unlock
the
door
and
let
go
inside
in
front
of
the
bench
where
the
ground
had
been
much
trodden
there
was
a
great
deal
of
loose
dust
diggory
went
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
producing
an
old
from
his
pocket
swept
about
a
square
yard
of
the
ground
until
the
dust
lay
in
a
perfectly
smooth
surface
there
he
said
rising
to
his
feet
again
we
do
this
the
last
thing
every
night
and
any
morning
if
we
find
the
cotton
gone
we
must
look
here
for
footprints
and
then
we
ought
to
be
able
to
tell
if
a
man
or
a
boy
do
you
think
we
ought
to
tell
blake
about
that
man
you
saw
asked
acton
as
they
walked
back
to
the
schoolroom
well
i
do
see
how
we
can
answered
diggory
the
first
thing
he
ask
will
be
who
saw
him
i
shall
say
did
and
then
want
to
know
how
i
saw
the
playground
door
from
my
bedroom
window
which
looks
out
on
the
road
and
then
the
fat
be
in
the
fire
and
it
all
come
out
about
that
supper
regularly
every
evening
as
soon
as
supper
was
over
the
two
boys
stole
down
into
the
playground
to
set
their
trap
but
when
morning
came
there
was
no
sign
of
the
shed
having
been
entered
this
went
on
for
nearly
a
month
but
still
no
result
i
do
think
it
any
good
bothering
about
it
any
more
said
acton
the
thief
does
mean
to
come
again
well
we
set
it
answered
diggory
and
that
shall
be
the
last
time
the
following
morning
acton
was
sauntering
towards
the
playground
when
diggory
came
running
up
the
path
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
i
say
the
cotton
gone
acton
rushed
down
unlocked
the
door
of
the
shed
and
went
inside
hullo
he
exclaimed
as
diggory
followed
some
man
look
at
these
footprints
and
hobnailed
boots
into
the
bargain
chapter
catching
a
tartar
it
was
impossible
for
two
boys
to
keep
such
an
important
discovery
to
themselves
and
the
shed
was
soon
filled
with
an
eager
crowd
all
anxious
to
view
the
mysterious
footprints
the
triple
alliance
gained
fresh
renown
as
the
originators
of
the
scheme
by
which
the
disclosure
had
been
made
and
it
was
unanimously
decided
that
the
matter
should
be
reported
to
blake
the
master
acton
and
diggory
but
seemed
rather
inclined
to
doubt
their
story
i
think
he
said
you
must
be
mistaken
i
expect
the
piece
of
cotton
blew
away
and
the
must
have
been
there
before
i
do
see
what
there
is
in
the
shed
that
should
make
it
worth
any
one
while
to
break
into
it
besides
if
the
door
was
locked
the
thief
must
have
broken
it
open
and
you
have
seen
the
marks
certainly
nothing
seemed
to
have
been
touched
and
as
no
boy
complained
of
any
of
his
property
having
been
stolen
the
subject
was
allowed
to
drop
and
the
usual
excitement
connected
with
the
end
of
term
and
the
near
approach
of
the
holidays
soon
caused
it
to
be
driven
from
every
one
thoughts
and
wellnigh
forgotten
with
the
commencement
of
the
winter
term
a
fresh
matter
filled
the
minds
of
the
triple
alliance
and
gave
them
plenty
of
food
for
discussion
and
on
returning
to
chatford
after
the
summer
holidays
they
discovered
that
all
three
were
destined
to
leave
at
christmas
and
proceed
to
ronleigh
college
a
large
school
in
the
neighbourhood
to
which
a
good
number
of
welsby
former
pupils
had
been
transferred
after
undergoing
a
preliminary
course
of
education
at
the
birches
letters
from
these
departed
heroes
containing
disjointed
descriptions
of
their
new
surroundings
awakened
a
feeling
of
interest
in
the
doings
of
the
ronleigh
college
boys
the
records
of
their
big
scores
at
cricket
or
their
victories
at
football
which
appeared
in
local
papers
were
always
read
with
admiration
and
the
name
of
an
old
birchite
appearing
in
either
of
the
teams
was
a
thing
of
which
every
one
felt
justly
proud
i
wish
i
was
going
too
said
acton
addressing
the
three
friends
but
my
people
are
going
to
send
me
to
a
school
in
germany
my
brother
john
is
there
he
one
of
the
big
chaps
and
is
captain
of
the
football
team
this
season
i
going
to
get
the
every
week
to
see
how
they
get
on
in
the
matches
early
in
october
the
were
put
up
in
the
field
and
the
birchites
commenced
their
football
practice
blake
was
a
leading
member
of
the
chatford
town
club
and
although
six
a
side
was
comparatively
a
poor
business
yet
under
his
instruction
they
gained
a
good
grounding
in
the
rudiments
of
the
soccer
of
the
period
the
old
system
of
dribbling
and
headlong
rushes
was
being
abandoned
in
favour
of
the
passing
game
and
forwards
were
learning
to
keep
their
places
and
to
play
as
a
whole
instead
of
as
individuals
come
here
you
fellows
said
the
master
walking
into
the
playground
one
morning
with
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
i
got
something
to
speak
about
the
boys
crowded
round
wondering
what
was
up
i
got
here
a
challenge
from
horace
house
to
play
a
match
against
them
either
on
our
ground
or
on
theirs
i
think
it
a
pity
that
you
should
have
an
opportunity
of
playing
against
strangers
of
course
they
are
bigger
and
heavier
than
we
are
and
we
should
probably
get
licked
but
that
is
the
question
any
sportsman
would
sooner
play
a
losing
game
than
no
game
at
all
and
it
be
good
practice
we
always
used
to
have
a
match
with
them
every
term
but
some
little
time
ago
there
seemed
to
be
a
lack
well
i
say
of
good
sportsmen
among
them
and
the
meetings
had
to
be
abandoned
i
talked
the
matter
over
with
welsby
and
he
seems
willing
to
give
the
thing
another
trial
an
excited
murmur
ran
through
the
crowd
wait
a
minute
interrupted
the
speaker
holding
up
his
hand
welsby
has
left
it
with
me
to
make
arrangements
for
the
match
and
i
shall
only
do
so
on
one
condition
i
know
that
since
the
event
happened
to
which
i
referred
a
moment
ago
a
decidedly
unfriendly
spirit
has
existed
between
you
and
the
boys
at
phillips
now
an
exhibition
of
this
feeling
on
a
football
field
would
be
a
disgrace
to
the
school
you
must
play
like
gentlemen
and
there
must
be
no
wrangling
or
disputing
they
are
agreeable
for
a
master
to
play
on
each
side
so
i
shall
act
as
captain
anything
that
has
to
be
said
must
be
left
to
me
and
i
shall
see
you
get
fair
play
do
you
clearly
understand
yes
sir
very
well
then
i
write
and
say
we
shall
be
pleased
to
play
them
here
on
saturday
week
the
prospect
of
mooting
the
philistines
in
the
open
field
filled
the
mind
of
every
boy
with
one
thought
and
the
whole
establishment
went
football
mad
it
was
played
in
the
schoolroom
and
passages
with
empty
and
balls
of
paper
in
the
bedrooms
with
slippers
and
sponges
and
even
in
their
dreams
fellows
kicked
the
off
and
woke
up
with
cries
of
goal
on
their
lips
blake
arranged
the
order
of
the
team
and
remarking
that
they
would
need
a
good
defence
put
himself
and
shaw
as
full
backs
acton
took
centre
forward
with
jack
vance
on
his
right
while
diggory
was
told
off
to
keep
goal
at
length
the
eventful
morning
arrived
class
came
utterly
to
grief
in
their
work
but
blake
understood
the
cause
and
set
the
same
lessons
over
again
for
monday
it
was
the
first
real
match
most
of
the
players
had
taken
part
in
and
as
they
stood
on
the
ground
waiting
for
their
opponents
to
arrive
every
one
was
trembling
with
excitement
the
only
exception
was
the
who
leaned
with
his
back
against
the
wall
cracking
nuts
and
remarking
that
he
wished
they
hurry
up
and
not
keep
us
waiting
all
day
at
length
there
was
a
sound
of
voices
in
the
lane
and
the
next
moment
the
enemy
entered
the
field
headed
by
their
fox
young
noaks
and
hogson
pounced
down
at
once
upon
the
practice
ball
and
began
kicking
it
about
with
great
energy
shouting
at
the
top
of
their
voices
and
evidently
wishing
to
make
an
impression
on
the
spectators
before
the
game
began
i
say
muttered
jacobs
they
awfully
big
well
what
does
that
matter
answered
diggory
cracking
another
nut
and
spitting
out
the
shell
they
are
going
to
eat
us
and
as
for
that
chap
noaks
he
all
noise
look
how
he
muffed
that
kick
blake
tossed
up
now
you
fellows
he
said
coming
up
to
his
followers
we
play
towards
the
road
get
to
your
places
and
remember
what
i
told
you
with
young
noaks
as
centre
forward
hogson
and
bernard
on
his
right
and
left
and
other
big
fellows
to
complete
the
line
of
hostile
forwards
the
home
team
seemed
to
stand
no
chance
against
their
opponents
the
visitors
bowled
them
over
like
ninepins
and
rushed
through
their
first
line
of
defence
as
though
it
never
existed
but
blake
stood
firm
and
kept
his
ground
like
the
english
squares
at
waterloo
attack
after
attack
swept
down
upon
him
only
to
break
up
like
waves
on
a
rock
and
the
ball
came
flying
back
with
a
shout
of
now
then
get
away
birches
twice
the
horace
house
wing
men
got
round
shaw
and
put
in
good
shots
but
diggory
saved
them
both
and
was
seen
a
moment
later
calmly
rewarding
himself
with
another
nut
gradually
as
the
time
slipped
away
and
no
score
was
made
the
birchites
began
to
realize
that
being
able
to
charge
was
everything
and
that
their
opponents
could
do
more
with
their
shoulders
than
with
their
feet
and
soon
lost
control
of
the
ball
when
bothered
by
the
halves
the
play
of
the
home
eleven
became
bolder
the
forwards
managed
a
run
or
two
and
though
the
philistines
had
certainly
the
upper
hand
yet
it
soon
became
obvious
to
them
that
it
was
no
mere
walk
over
and
that
victory
would
have
to
be
struggled
for
noaks
and
the
two
inside
forwards
evidently
did
not
relish
this
state
of
things
they
had
expected
an
easy
win
and
began
to
show
their
disappointment
in
the
increased
roughness
of
their
play
at
length
just
before
a
thing
happened
which
very
nearly
caused
blake
followers
to
break
their
promise
cross
was
badly
kicked
while
attempting
to
take
the
ball
from
hogson
and
had
to
retire
from
the
game
there
were
some
black
looks
and
a
murmur
of
indignation
among
the
home
team
but
blake
hushed
it
up
in
a
moment
i
think
he
said
pleasantly
that
the
play
is
a
trifle
rough
our
men
he
added
laughing
are
rather
under
size
noaks
muttered
something
about
not
funking
but
fox
said
yes
just
so
come
play
the
game
boys
and
think
less
about
charging
the
loss
of
their
right
was
distinctly
felt
by
the
birchites
during
the
commencement
of
the
second
half
and
diggory
was
called
upon
three
times
in
quick
succession
to
save
his
charge
he
acquitted
himself
like
a
brick
and
the
last
time
did
a
thing
which
afforded
his
side
an
immense
amount
of
secret
satisfaction
he
caught
the
ball
in
his
hands
and
at
the
same
moment
noaks
made
a
fierce
rush
meaning
to
knock
him
through
the
goal
diggory
with
an
engaging
smile
hopped
on
one
side
and
the
philistine
flung
himself
against
the
post
and
bumped
his
head
with
a
violence
which
might
have
cracked
any
ordinary
skull
he
came
back
scowling
a
moment
later
jack
vance
ran
into
him
and
took
the
ball
from
between
his
feet
noaks
charged
viciously
and
in
a
blind
fit
of
temper
deliberately
raised
his
fist
and
struck
the
other
player
in
the
face
it
was
blake
voice
and
he
came
striding
up
the
ground
looking
as
black
as
thunder
i
protest
against
that
deliberate
piece
of
foul
play
i
have
played
against
all
the
chief
clubs
in
the
district
and
in
any
of
those
matches
if
such
a
thing
had
happened
this
man
would
have
been
ordered
off
the
ground
there
was
a
buzz
of
approval
in
which
several
of
the
philistines
joined
you
are
quite
right
blake
answered
fox
i
deeply
regret
that
the
game
should
have
been
spoiled
by
a
member
of
my
noaks
he
added
turning
to
the
culprit
put
on
your
coat
and
go
home
you
have
disgraced
yourself
and
your
comrades
i
shall
see
that
you
send
a
written
apology
to
the
boy
you
struck
bravo
whispered
acton
old
fox
is
a
good
sort
oh
they
most
of
them
all
right
answered
morris
it
only
two
or
three
that
are
such
beasts
the
game
was
continued
the
loss
of
one
man
on
each
side
made
the
teams
equal
in
numbers
but
the
sudden
calamity
which
had
overtaken
their
centre
forward
seemed
to
have
exerted
a
very
demoralizing
effect
on
the
philistines
their
attacks
were
not
nearly
so
spirited
and
several
times
the
birchite
forwards
appeared
in
front
of
their
goal
neither
side
had
scored
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
game
would
end
in
a
draw
a
result
which
the
home
team
would
have
considered
highly
satisfactory
the
umpire
looked
at
his
watch
and
in
answer
to
a
query
from
fox
said
five
minutes
more
look
here
acton
said
blake
let
me
take
your
place
and
you
go
back
do
all
you
can
to
stop
them
if
they
come
the
ball
was
thrown
out
of
touch
blake
got
it
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
fight
was
raging
in
the
very
mouth
of
the
enemy
goal
morris
put
in
a
capital
shot
but
the
ball
glanced
off
one
of
the
players
and
went
behind
corner
cried
blake
i
take
it
now
you
fellows
get
it
through
somehow
or
other
mark
your
men
horace
house
cried
fox
the
next
moment
every
one
was
shoving
and
elbowing
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
ball
as
it
flew
through
the
air
it
dropped
in
exactly
the
right
place
and
jack
vance
by
some
happy
fluke
kicked
it
just
as
it
touched
the
ground
like
a
big
round
shot
it
whizzed
through
the
posts
and
there
was
a
rapturous
yell
of
the
delight
of
the
birchites
at
having
beaten
their
opponents
was
unbounded
and
when
a
short
time
later
the
latter
retired
with
a
score
against
them
of
one
to
nil
jack
vance
was
seized
by
a
band
of
applauding
comrades
who
with
his
head
about
a
couple
of
feet
lower
than
his
heels
carried
him
in
triumph
across
the
playground
and
staggered
up
the
steep
garden
path
when
acton
happening
to
tread
on
a
loose
pebble
brought
the
whole
procession
to
grief
and
caused
the
noble
band
of
conquering
heroes
to
be
seen
all
grovelling
in
a
mixed
heap
upon
the
gravel
but
it
is
not
for
the
simple
purpose
of
recording
the
victory
over
horace
house
that
a
description
of
the
match
has
been
introduced
into
our
story
and
although
the
important
part
played
by
diggory
in
goal
and
jack
vance
in
the
fighting
line
caused
it
to
be
an
occasion
when
the
triple
alliance
was
decidedly
in
evidence
and
won
fresh
laurels
yet
there
are
other
reasons
which
make
an
account
of
it
necessary
as
the
reader
will
discover
in
following
the
course
of
subsequent
events
if
jack
vance
had
kicked
the
ball
a
yard
over
the
bar
instead
of
under
it
the
probability
is
that
the
following
chapter
would
never
have
been
written
while
the
public
disgrace
of
young
noaks
was
destined
to
cause
our
three
comrades
more
trouble
than
they
ever
expected
to
encounter
at
all
events
on
this
side
of
their
leaving
school
if
the
result
of
the
match
made
such
a
great
impression
on
the
minds
of
the
victors
it
is
only
natural
that
it
should
have
had
a
similar
effect
on
the
hearts
of
their
opponents
most
of
the
philistines
would
have
been
content
to
take
their
defeat
as
a
sportsman
should
but
neither
noaks
nor
his
two
cronies
hogson
and
bernard
had
any
of
this
manly
spirit
about
them
and
smarting
under
the
disappointment
of
not
having
won
and
the
knowledge
that
at
least
one
of
them
had
reaped
shame
and
contempt
instead
of
glory
they
determined
to
seek
a
speedy
revenge
as
the
three
biggest
boys
in
the
school
they
had
little
difficulty
in
inducing
their
companions
to
join
in
the
crusade
which
they
preached
against
the
birches
and
the
consequence
was
that
the
two
schools
were
soon
exchanging
open
hostilities
with
greater
vigour
than
ever
now
although
the
birchites
had
proved
themselves
equal
to
their
opponents
at
football
they
would
have
stood
no
chance
against
them
in
anything
like
a
personal
encounter
the
other
party
were
of
course
perfectly
well
aware
of
this
fact
and
waxed
bold
in
consequence
again
and
again
when
welsby
pupils
were
at
football
practice
and
blake
happened
not
to
be
present
the
enemy
crept
into
ambush
behind
the
hedge
and
discharged
stones
from
their
catapults
at
the
legs
of
the
players
while
the
latter
replied
by
inquiring
when
they
meant
to
come
over
and
take
another
licking
at
other
times
these
horace
house
cossacks
swooped
down
on
single
members
of
the
rival
establishment
harrying
them
in
the
very
streets
of
chatford
and
on
one
occasion
had
the
audacity
to
lay
violent
hands
on
jacobs
beat
his
bowler
hat
down
over
his
eyes
and
push
him
through
the
folding
doors
of
a
drapery
establishment
where
he
upset
an
and
three
chairs
had
his
ears
boxed
by
the
and
was
threatened
with
the
police
court
if
ever
he
did
such
a
thing
again
at
length
it
became
positively
perilous
for
the
weaker
party
to
go
beyond
the
precincts
of
their
own
citadel
except
in
bodies
of
three
or
four
together
all
kinds
of
plans
for
retaliation
were
suggested
but
still
the
philistines
continued
to
score
heavily
at
length
about
the
last
week
in
october
a
thing
happened
which
raised
the
wrath
of
the
birchites
to
cross
having
received
five
shillings
from
home
on
the
morning
of
his
birthday
determined
to
celebrate
the
occasion
by
the
purchase
of
a
of
which
he
had
previously
invited
all
his
companions
to
partake
the
latter
were
standing
in
the
playground
waiting
for
his
return
from
chatford
when
they
became
conscious
of
certain
alarms
without
whoops
and
sounded
somewhere
down
locker
lane
and
ceased
as
suddenly
as
they
had
begun
the
boys
stood
for
some
moments
wondering
what
this
could
mean
and
were
just
thinking
of
starting
a
fresh
game
of
catch
smugglers
when
there
came
a
banging
at
the
door
it
was
flung
open
and
cross
rushed
into
their
midst
flushed
dishevelled
and
what
words
of
mine
can
tell
that
tale
of
woe
or
describe
the
burst
of
indignation
which
followed
its
recital
cross
had
unwisely
decided
to
shorten
his
return
journey
by
risking
the
dangers
of
lane
he
had
been
captured
by
a
party
of
philistines
who
under
the
leadership
of
hogson
had
not
only
robbed
him
of
his
pie
but
had
held
him
prisoner
while
they
devoured
it
before
his
very
eyes
what
this
terrible
outrage
would
have
excited
those
who
had
suffered
this
cruel
wrong
to
do
in
return
whether
they
would
have
started
off
there
and
then
burnt
horace
house
to
the
ground
and
hung
its
inhabitants
on
the
surrounding
trees
it
would
be
hard
to
say
as
it
was
at
this
very
moment
a
was
forced
upon
their
attention
by
morris
who
came
shouldering
his
way
into
their
midst
saying
look
here
you
fellows
some
one
stolen
my
watch
and
chain
it
seemed
as
if
a
perfect
shower
of
thunderbolts
had
commenced
to
descend
from
a
clear
sky
upon
the
devoted
heads
of
welsby
pupils
every
one
stared
at
his
neighbour
in
mute
amazement
and
only
fred
acton
remained
in
sufficient
possession
of
his
faculties
to
gasp
out
it
true
continued
morris
excitedly
i
did
change
for
football
yesterday
afternoon
but
before
going
into
the
field
i
hung
my
watch
up
on
a
nail
in
the
shed
and
stupidly
forgot
all
about
it
until
i
came
to
wind
it
up
last
night
then
it
was
too
late
to
fetch
it
and
now
it
gone
look
here
cried
acton
glaring
round
the
group
with
an
unusually
ferocious
look
who
knows
anything
about
this
speak
up
ca
you
we
had
enough
of
this
prigging
business
and
i
sick
of
it
no
one
attempted
to
reply
well
continued
the
dux
i
going
straight
off
to
old
welsby
to
tell
him
and
i
wo
keep
the
key
of
that
place
of
course
it
makes
me
look
as
if
i
were
the
thief
and
i
wo
stand
it
any
longer
the
speaker
turned
on
his
heel
and
strode
off
in
the
direction
of
the
house
oh
i
say
muttered
jack
vance
now
there
be
a
row
jack
prophecy
was
soon
fulfilled
the
watch
and
chain
could
not
be
found
and
there
was
but
little
doubt
that
they
had
been
stolen
welsby
called
the
boys
together
and
though
he
spoke
in
a
calm
and
collected
manner
with
no
trace
of
passion
in
his
voice
yet
his
words
made
them
all
tremble
miss
eleanor
sat
silent
at
the
with
a
shocked
expression
on
her
face
and
blake
when
told
of
the
occurrence
said
sharply
well
we
better
have
locks
put
on
everything
and
the
sooner
the
better
acton
produced
his
bunch
of
keys
and
insisted
that
all
his
possessions
should
be
searched
and
every
one
else
followed
his
example
the
whole
of
the
next
afternoon
was
spent
in
a
careful
examination
of
desks
and
boxes
but
with
no
result
beyond
the
discovery
that
mugford
owned
a
cord
waistcoat
which
he
had
had
the
moral
courage
to
wear
there
is
one
feature
in
the
administration
of
justice
by
an
english
court
which
is
unhappily
too
often
overlooked
in
the
lynch
law
of
schoolboys
and
that
is
the
principle
that
a
man
shall
be
considered
innocent
until
he
has
been
clearly
proved
guilty
smarting
under
a
sense
of
shame
which
was
entirely
unmerited
every
boy
sought
eagerly
for
some
object
on
which
to
vent
his
indignation
it
became
necessary
to
use
the
words
of
the
comic
opera
that
a
victim
should
be
found
and
suspicion
fell
on
kennedy
and
jacobs
the
result
of
diggory
trap
seemed
to
show
that
the
various
thefts
had
been
committed
at
night
it
was
agreed
that
the
two
occupants
of
the
had
special
opportunity
for
getting
out
of
the
house
if
so
minded
every
other
room
had
one
or
more
fellows
in
it
who
had
suffered
the
loss
of
some
property
and
lastly
kennedy
was
known
to
possess
a
pair
of
which
he
usually
kept
under
his
bed
the
two
boys
indignantly
denied
the
accusation
when
it
was
first
brought
against
them
but
the
very
vehemence
with
which
they
protested
their
innocence
was
regarded
as
put
on
and
accepted
as
an
additional
proof
of
their
guilt
the
evidence
however
was
not
thought
sufficient
to
warrant
bringing
a
charge
against
them
before
the
and
accordingly
it
was
decided
to
send
them
both
to
coventry
until
some
fresh
light
should
be
brought
to
bear
upon
the
case
to
do
full
justice
to
the
memory
of
diggory
trevanock
he
alone
stood
out
against
this
decision
and
incurred
the
wrath
both
of
acton
and
jack
vance
in
so
doing
he
continued
to
affirm
that
it
must
be
the
man
he
had
seen
in
the
playground
on
the
occasion
of
the
first
meeting
of
the
supper
club
and
that
the
footprint
in
the
dust
had
been
a
man
and
much
larger
than
kennedy
boot
could
have
produced
this
outlawing
of
the
and
difference
of
opinion
with
diggory
spoiled
all
chance
of
games
and
good
fellowship
even
the
association
of
the
triple
alliance
seemed
likely
to
end
in
an
open
rupture
and
very
possibly
might
have
done
so
if
it
had
not
been
for
an
event
which
caused
the
members
to
reunite
against
the
common
enemy
one
afternoon
mugford
and
diggory
had
gone
down
to
chatford
it
was
nearly
dark
when
they
started
to
come
back
and
the
latter
proposed
the
short
cut
by
locker
lane
i
not
afraid
of
the
philistines
besides
they
wo
see
us
now
as
they
drew
near
to
horace
house
a
solitary
figure
was
discovered
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
brick
wall
it
young
noaks
whispered
diggory
it
too
late
to
turn
back
but
most
likely
he
wo
notice
us
in
this
light
if
we
walk
straight
on
they
passed
him
successfully
and
were
just
opposite
the
entrance
when
three
more
boys
sauntered
through
the
doorway
a
gleam
of
light
from
the
house
happened
to
fall
on
diggory
cap
and
broad
white
collar
and
immediately
the
shout
was
raised
there
was
a
rush
of
feet
a
wild
moment
of
grabbing
and
dodging
and
mugford
who
had
managed
somehow
to
shake
himself
free
from
the
grasp
of
his
assailants
dashed
off
at
full
speed
down
the
road
after
running
for
about
two
hundred
yards
and
finding
he
was
not
followed
he
pulled
up
waited
and
listened
and
then
began
cautiously
to
retrace
his
steps
there
was
no
sign
either
of
his
companion
or
the
enemy
and
though
he
ventured
back
as
far
as
the
double
doors
which
were
now
closed
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
he
knew
in
a
moment
that
his
had
been
captured
but
all
hope
of
attempting
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
rescue
was
out
of
the
question
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
storm
the
fortress
and
so
after
lingering
about
for
some
minutes
in
the
hope
that
his
friend
would
reappear
he
ran
home
as
fast
as
he
could
and
bursting
into
the
schoolroom
where
most
of
his
schoolfellows
sat
reading
round
the
fire
threw
them
into
a
great
state
of
consternation
and
dismay
by
proclaiming
in
a
loud
voice
the
alarming
intelligence
that
diggory
had
been
taken
prisoner
and
was
at
that
moment
in
the
hands
of
the
philistines
chapter
vi
gunpowder
plot
the
news
caused
a
profound
sensation
the
like
of
which
had
probably
never
been
witnessed
at
the
birches
before
no
not
even
on
that
memorable
occasion
when
the
intelligence
arrived
that
scourer
one
of
the
past
seniors
had
ridden
his
bicycle
through
the
window
of
brown
big
and
was
being
brought
home
on
a
shutter
all
the
boys
threw
down
their
books
and
started
to
their
feet
acton
and
vance
banished
from
their
minds
all
thought
of
the
disagreement
which
had
lately
estranged
them
from
their
unfortunate
and
joined
heartily
in
the
general
outburst
of
wrath
and
consternation
the
thought
that
diggory
their
was
at
that
very
moment
languishing
a
prisoner
of
war
in
the
hands
of
the
philistines
was
almost
unbearable
what
will
they
do
with
him
where
have
they
put
him
how
can
we
rescue
the
fellow
were
questions
which
everybody
was
asking
but
no
one
could
answer
it
seemed
altogether
beyond
their
power
to
do
anything
and
yet
there
was
not
a
boy
who
would
not
have
given
his
dearest
possession
were
it
a
white
rat
or
a
stamp
collection
if
by
parting
with
it
he
could
have
rendered
some
assistance
to
his
comrade
there
only
half
an
hour
before
tea
said
vance
looking
up
at
the
clock
if
anything
can
be
done
we
must
do
it
at
once
the
precious
moments
sped
away
but
in
vain
did
the
assembly
rack
their
brains
for
some
plan
of
action
which
might
in
any
way
be
likely
to
serve
the
purpose
they
had
in
view
the
first
wild
suggestion
that
they
should
go
in
a
body
and
carry
horace
house
by
storm
was
abandoned
as
impracticable
in
hopeless
inactivity
they
stood
watching
the
long
hand
of
the
clock
creep
up
from
six
till
twelve
the
first
had
just
finished
ringing
when
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
hurrying
along
the
passage
the
door
burst
open
and
in
rushed
no
other
person
than
diggory
himself
hullo
how
did
you
get
away
what
have
they
been
doing
how
did
you
escape
oh
such
a
lark
cried
the
boy
they
wish
they
never
caught
me
i
tell
you
all
about
it
after
tea
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
diggory
was
seized
hurried
up
into
the
schoolroom
and
there
forced
to
relate
his
adventures
well
he
began
they
collared
me
and
dragged
me
through
the
gates
and
along
into
their
playground
noaks
looked
at
me
and
said
here
luck
this
is
the
young
beggar
who
tied
that
rope
to
the
scrapers
i
vote
we
give
him
a
jolly
good
licking
i
told
them
that
my
father
was
a
lawyer
and
if
any
of
them
touched
me
he
take
a
summons
out
against
them
for
assault
that
frightened
noaks
for
you
can
see
he
a
regular
coward
so
he
asked
the
others
what
they
thought
had
better
be
done
with
me
know
said
hogson
an
old
in
the
field
next
to
ours
let
shut
him
in
and
keep
him
there
till
after
tea
he
get
a
jolly
row
for
being
late
when
he
gets
back
and
he
wo
dare
to
say
where
he
been
because
i
know
it
against
their
rules
to
come
anywhere
near
us
and
locker
lane
is
out
of
bounds
if
he
does
tell
we
swear
he
was
in
the
road
chucking
stones
at
the
windows
some
one
said
there
was
only
a
staple
on
the
door
of
the
shed
but
noaks
said
he
fetch
the
padlock
off
his
and
so
he
did
well
they
took
me
across
their
playing
field
and
over
the
hedge
into
the
next
and
shut
me
up
in
this
beastly
old
hovel
no
use
your
making
a
row
said
hogson
no
one
hear
you
and
if
you
do
summons
or
no
summons
we
come
down
and
give
you
a
licking
after
that
they
left
me
and
went
back
to
the
house
and
as
soon
as
they
gone
i
began
to
try
to
find
some
way
of
escape
but
it
was
so
dark
inside
the
shed
i
could
see
anything
presently
i
heard
a
knocking
on
the
boards
there
was
a
wide
crack
between
them
in
one
place
and
looking
through
it
i
could
just
make
out
that
there
was
some
boy
standing
there
with
what
looked
like
a
dirty
apron
over
his
trousers
i
said
and
he
said
what
up
who
are
you
and
what
have
they
been
of
you
in
there
for
i
told
him
and
asked
him
who
he
was
and
it
turned
out
his
name
was
joe
crump
and
he
the
boy
who
cleans
the
knives
at
philips
he
happened
to
be
knocking
about
when
they
took
me
prisoner
and
he
could
see
who
it
was
in
the
dark
and
thought
it
might
be
his
younger
brother
who
comes
on
errands
from
the
grocer
the
philistines
are
always
playing
tricks
on
him
i
said
here
joe
crump
you
let
me
out
there
a
good
chap
but
he
would
he
was
afraid
of
what
young
noaks
would
do
to
him
at
last
i
gave
him
a
shilling
through
the
crack
of
the
boards
and
vowed
i
would
say
who
done
it
and
then
he
undid
the
door
i
fastened
the
padlock
again
and
threw
the
key
into
the
hedge
for
noaks
had
left
it
in
the
keyhole
so
now
he
wo
be
able
to
get
his
lock
again
unless
he
either
breaks
it
or
the
staple
and
they
both
pretty
tough
after
that
i
got
round
through
two
other
fields
into
the
lane
and
here
i
am
the
conclusion
of
diggory
story
was
hailed
with
shouts
of
triumph
to
imagine
the
disappointment
of
the
philistines
when
they
discovered
that
the
bird
had
flown
and
the
chagrin
of
young
noaks
when
he
found
that
his
padlock
was
fastened
to
the
door
of
the
shed
was
simply
delightful
and
acton
was
so
carried
away
that
he
once
more
fell
on
diggory
neck
and
pretended
to
shed
tears
of
joy
upon
the
broad
collar
but
that
not
all
cried
the
youngster
shaking
himself
free
from
his
leader
embrace
the
best
is
this
i
had
a
bit
of
a
talk
with
joe
crump
before
i
came
away
and
he
says
that
young
noaks
is
going
to
leave
at
the
end
of
this
term
and
he
been
telling
the
philistines
that
before
he
goes
he
means
to
do
something
that
pay
us
out
for
his
being
sent
off
the
field
in
that
football
match
crump
does
know
what
he
means
to
do
but
i
made
him
promise
if
he
finds
out
to
come
and
tell
me
and
i
give
him
another
shilling
then
we
shall
be
prepared
i
say
diggy
exclaimed
jack
vance
you
are
a
and
the
bell
now
commencing
to
ring
for
evening
preparation
the
meeting
terminated
it
was
an
annual
custom
at
the
birches
for
the
boys
to
subscribe
towards
getting
a
display
of
fireworks
which
were
let
off
in
the
playground
under
the
superintendence
of
blake
the
himself
gave
a
donation
towards
the
fund
and
allowed
the
boys
to
prepare
the
next
day
work
in
the
afternoon
instead
of
in
the
evening
this
year
however
when
acton
went
as
usual
to
the
library
to
formally
ask
permission
that
the
celebration
should
take
place
he
met
with
a
terrible
rebuff
no
acton
answered
welsby
as
long
as
the
school
continues
to
be
disgraced
by
these
repeated
thefts
as
for
example
this
recent
instance
of
morris
watch
and
chain
i
do
not
feel
inclined
to
allow
the
same
privileges
as
before
there
will
be
no
fireworks
this
term
as
may
be
imagined
when
the
dux
reported
the
result
of
his
visit
to
the
news
created
great
excitement
the
unfortunate
occupants
of
the
who
were
still
in
the
position
of
scapegoats
were
hunted
round
the
place
by
an
indignant
mob
and
fled
vainly
protesting
their
innocence
from
one
shelter
to
another
until
they
finally
escaped
from
the
playing
field
into
the
open
country
where
they
hid
behind
hedges
for
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
look
here
exclaimed
jack
vance
as
the
triple
alliance
were
wending
their
way
from
the
playground
to
the
house
there
only
one
thing
to
be
done
and
that
is
we
must
set
miss
eleanor
on
old
welsby
track
she
make
him
alter
his
mind
some
one
must
go
and
ask
acton
you
the
man
you
must
do
it
i
shot
if
i
do
answered
the
dux
turning
round
to
face
the
trio
and
walking
backwards
up
the
path
why
should
i
go
more
than
any
other
fellow
why
because
you
got
such
a
way
with
you
returned
diggory
she
be
sure
to
do
it
for
you
why
the
last
time
you
spoke
to
her
she
gave
you
a
lump
of
cake
acton
seized
the
speaker
by
the
neck
and
shook
him
like
a
rat
you
the
cheekiest
little
imp
i
ever
came
across
he
said
i
a
jolly
good
mind
to
give
you
a
good
licking
only
i
do
believe
care
if
i
did
well
anyhow
you
got
to
go
answered
diggory
calmly
picking
up
his
cap
which
had
fallen
to
the
ground
and
if
you
afraid
to
go
alone
for
fear
she
should
think
it
another
proposal
i
come
with
you
after
some
further
discussion
it
was
agreed
that
the
thing
should
be
attempted
the
two
boys
found
miss
eleanor
making
cake
and
the
conference
began
by
diggory
having
his
ears
boxed
for
picking
plums
out
of
the
dough
but
no
one
ever
appealed
to
miss
eleanor
without
being
sure
at
all
events
of
a
patient
hearing
and
the
following
morning
welsby
informed
the
school
that
he
had
been
led
to
reconsider
his
decision
regarding
the
fifth
of
november
and
that
they
might
have
their
display
as
usual
accordingly
the
fireworks
were
ordered
and
arrived
soon
after
breakfast
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
miss
eleanor
had
a
dread
of
gunpowder
and
blake
sent
jack
vance
to
tell
noaks
to
carry
the
box
as
usual
down
into
the
shed
humph
growled
the
man
as
the
boy
gave
him
the
message
it
a
nice
thing
that
i
should
have
to
fetch
and
carry
all
your
fooling
playthings
for
you
it
a
pity
you
young
ca
do
something
for
yourselves
instead
of
bothering
me
well
it
is
my
orders
answered
jack
it
mr
blake
blake
is
it
all
right
i
do
it
when
i
can
spare
the
time
when
the
boys
came
out
at
interval
the
box
was
still
lying
about
in
the
yard
although
there
were
heavy
clouds
overhead
threatening
rain
blake
sent
for
noaks
and
a
rather
sharp
passage
of
arms
took
place
between
them
which
ended
in
the
man
being
told
to
leave
what
he
was
doing
and
carry
the
fireworks
down
to
the
shed
i
believe
he
left
them
on
purpose
in
the
hope
they
get
wet
said
shaw
he
hates
us
all
like
poison
and
i
believe
it
all
because
his
son
at
the
other
school
remember
what
a
row
he
kicked
up
when
he
heard
acton
say
that
the
philistines
were
cads
for
shooting
at
us
with
catapults
yes
answered
morris
and
if
he
hates
us
he
hates
blake
a
jolly
sight
worse
he
been
like
it
ever
since
that
football
match
and
he
get
sacked
if
he
does
mind
for
blake
wo
stand
his
cheek
much
longer
the
purchase
of
fireworks
had
this
year
been
more
extensive
than
on
any
previous
occasion
and
every
one
was
looking
forward
with
great
anticipation
to
the
business
of
the
following
evening
i
say
diggy
cried
acton
at
the
close
of
afternoon
school
i
wish
you
run
down
into
the
playground
and
bring
up
that
football
flag
that
got
to
be
mended
i
left
it
in
the
corner
by
the
shed
i
go
myself
but
i
want
to
finish
this
letter
before
tea
diggory
trotted
off
to
fetch
the
flag
and
jack
vance
who
was
loitering
about
one
of
the
passages
accompanied
him
down
into
the
playground
it
was
very
dark
the
stars
being
hidden
by
heavy
clouds
i
say
exclaimed
diggory
it
be
a
splendid
night
for
the
fireworks
if
it
like
this
we
must
get
hark
what
that
i
did
hear
anything
yes
there
was
a
sort
of
a
rapping
sound
hush
there
it
is
again
jack
heard
it
this
time
it
some
one
knocking
very
gently
against
that
door
leading
into
locker
lane
he
whispered
they
groped
their
way
across
the
playground
until
they
reached
the
wall
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
some
one
was
gently
tapping
with
his
knuckles
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
who
there
asked
jack
vance
i
want
to
speak
to
the
young
who
was
locked
up
day
in
the
was
the
answer
given
in
a
low
voice
which
diggory
instantly
recognized
i
know
him
he
said
it
joe
crump
here
give
me
a
leg
up
and
i
talk
to
him
over
the
all
right
joe
i
the
chap
well
if
you
are
answered
the
voice
you
remember
you
offered
me
a
bob
if
i
could
find
out
and
tell
you
when
somebody
was
going
to
do
something
well
what
the
news
give
me
the
money
first
and
then
i
tell
you
jack
vance
fortunately
had
the
required
coin
in
his
pocket
and
diggory
dropped
it
into
joe
crump
cap
well
the
news
is
this
said
the
latter
speaking
in
the
same
low
tone
that
there
noaks
and
hogson
are
coming
up
here
just
afore
nine
and
they
to
drown
your
fireworks
drown
our
fireworks
why
what
ever
mean
how
do
they
know
got
any
fireworks
and
how
can
they
get
at
them
when
they
all
locked
up
i
ca
say
returned
crump
so
it
no
use
asking
me
i
only
knows
that
noaks
is
to
do
it
all
in
a
bucket
of
water
was
what
he
said
remember
you
promised
to
tell
nothink
about
me
that
all
mister
the
stranger
vanished
in
the
darkness
and
diggory
dropped
down
from
the
wall
here
a
pretty
go
he
remarked
what
are
we
to
do
there
no
time
to
lose
come
on
jack
let
go
and
tell
acton
the
latter
was
engaged
on
the
closing
sentence
of
his
letter
but
on
hearing
the
intelligence
which
diggory
had
to
impart
he
threw
the
unfinished
epistle
into
his
desk
and
rose
to
his
feet
with
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
think
it
really
true
or
is
this
fellow
lump
or
bump
or
whatever
you
call
him
trying
to
take
a
rise
out
of
us
or
telling
lies
to
earn
the
shilling
i
do
think
so
answered
diggory
and
i
tell
you
why
for
some
reason
or
other
he
at
daggers
drawn
with
young
noaks
and
hogson
i
think
they
knocked
him
about
and
he
doing
it
to
pay
them
out
but
how
did
they
get
to
know
about
our
fireworks
and
how
do
they
reckon
they
going
to
get
them
out
of
the
shed
look
here
had
we
better
tell
blake
we
ca
do
that
answered
jack
vance
or
it
get
diggy
in
a
row
if
he
says
anything
about
joe
crump
it
all
come
out
about
his
having
been
in
locker
lane
when
the
philistines
caught
him
and
of
course
that
against
rules
what
time
did
he
say
they
meant
to
come
about
a
quarter
to
nine
there
was
a
silence
which
lasted
for
over
a
minute
then
diggory
spoke
this
is
what
i
think
we
better
do
if
they
come
at
all
they
are
certain
to
be
here
soon
after
eight
because
i
heard
fox
telling
blake
on
the
day
of
the
match
that
they
go
to
bed
at
nine
we
wo
tell
any
one
but
as
soon
as
is
over
we
cut
down
into
the
playground
and
when
they
come
we
kick
up
a
row
they
soon
make
tracks
if
they
find
they
discovered
and
it
be
better
than
saying
anything
to
blake
about
it
and
we
shall
have
defeated
them
ourselves
all
right
answered
acton
but
it
look
queer
if
we
all
three
stop
out
from
supper
two
enough
i
go
for
one
and
you
and
vance
toss
up
this
suggestion
was
accepted
with
some
reluctance
as
both
boys
were
anxious
to
take
part
in
the
adventure
acton
word
however
was
law
and
eventually
diggory
was
chosen
by
fate
to
be
his
companion
directly
after
tea
all
the
boys
paid
a
visit
to
the
shed
the
door
was
securely
locked
as
also
was
the
one
leading
into
locker
lane
and
it
seemed
impossible
for
the
philistines
to
carry
out
their
evil
designs
upon
the
fireworks
i
believe
it
all
bunkum
said
acton
as
they
strolled
back
towards
the
house
however
we
come
down
as
we
said
and
just
see
if
anything
happens
three
boys
at
all
events
did
very
little
work
that
evening
for
it
was
impossible
to
concentrate
one
mind
on
caesar
or
on
french
verbs
with
such
an
adventure
looming
in
the
near
future
how
would
the
philistines
get
at
the
fireworks
would
they
change
their
minds
and
instead
of
drowning
them
apply
a
slow
match
and
blow
up
the
shed
or
would
it
after
all
turn
out
to
be
only
a
false
alarm
raised
by
the
boy
crump
for
the
sake
of
the
promised
shilling
these
and
other
thoughts
filled
the
minds
of
the
trio
as
they
sat
frowning
at
the
books
in
front
of
them
the
clock
seemed
to
go
slower
and
slower
until
they
really
began
to
wonder
whether
it
had
stopped
at
length
the
long
hand
reached
the
blake
yawned
put
down
his
paper
and
said
put
away
your
work
and
pass
on
to
supper
acton
and
diggory
both
tingling
with
excitement
lingered
behind
until
the
rest
had
left
the
room
then
when
the
coast
was
clear
they
slipped
out
into
the
garden
and
hurried
down
the
sloping
path
it
was
considerably
lighter
than
it
had
been
before
tea
the
clouds
had
cleared
away
and
there
were
plenty
of
stars
locked
muttered
acton
examining
the
shed
locked
he
repeated
trying
the
door
leading
into
locker
lane
i
do
believe
anything
in
it
they
might
get
over
the
wall
if
one
gave
the
other
a
leg
up
but
then
how
the
last
man
to
get
back
again
well
if
there
nothing
in
it
answered
diggory
how
should
joe
crump
have
got
to
know
we
had
any
fireworks
in
the
place
there
must
hush
what
that
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
coming
down
the
path
from
the
house
cried
acton
it
blake
let
hide
several
shrubs
growing
in
the
garden
and
overhanging
the
boarded
partition
threw
one
corner
of
the
playground
into
deep
shadow
the
boys
rushed
into
the
angle
and
crouching
down
in
the
inky
darkness
were
at
once
hidden
from
the
view
of
any
one
who
might
advance
even
to
within
a
few
feet
of
their
they
had
hardly
time
to
conceal
themselves
when
a
man
the
outline
of
whose
figure
they
could
just
make
out
in
the
gloom
came
through
the
garden
door
and
advancing
a
few
yards
stood
still
turning
his
head
from
side
to
side
as
though
looking
to
make
sure
that
the
quadrangle
was
empty
he
heard
us
talking
whispered
acton
the
having
apparently
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
alone
walked
slowly
across
to
the
shed
halted
in
front
of
the
door
and
the
next
moment
there
was
the
sound
of
a
key
being
fitted
into
the
lock
at
that
instant
diggory
who
had
been
craning
his
neck
forward
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
intruder
suddenly
gripped
acton
arm
and
putting
his
mouth
close
to
the
latter
ear
whispered
is
blake
it
old
noaks
now
keep
quiet
he
added
as
his
companion
made
a
movement
as
though
he
meant
to
rush
out
of
their
let
see
what
he
does
he
the
thief
who
stole
all
those
things
answered
acton
excitedly
he
must
have
another
key
and
he
going
to
bag
something
now
noaks
for
certainly
it
was
he
disappeared
inside
the
shed
but
in
a
few
seconds
he
was
out
again
and
once
more
stood
waiting
as
though
undecided
what
to
do
next
before
the
boys
could
have
counted
ten
there
was
a
low
whistle
in
the
lane
they
come
whispered
diggory
he
got
the
key
of
the
door
and
is
going
to
let
them
in
his
words
were
speedily
verified
and
the
next
moment
two
more
figures
entered
the
playground
the
object
of
their
visit
being
at
once
made
evident
by
the
fact
that
one
of
them
was
carrying
a
bucket
it
was
too
dark
to
distinguish
their
faces
but
the
short
conversation
which
took
place
on
their
entry
soon
made
them
known
to
the
two
watchers
now
then
said
old
noaks
if
you
going
to
do
it
just
look
sharp
awful
joke
is
it
dad
answered
one
of
the
lend
us
a
hand
and
we
dip
all
in
this
bucket
and
put
back
again
no
i
sha
returned
the
man
i
do
know
nothink
about
it
it
your
game
and
all
i
promised
was
i
open
the
door
well
show
us
where
the
box
come
on
hogson
do
make
more
row
than
you
can
help
after
a
moment
hesitation
and
some
muttered
remarks
about
that
there
blake
and
them
uppish
young
dogs
noaks
senior
led
the
way
across
the
gravel
and
followed
by
the
two
philistines
entered
the
shed
hardly
had
they
crossed
the
threshold
when
diggory
started
up
kicked
off
his
slippers
crept
swiftly
and
noiselessly
as
a
shadow
across
the
ground
and
before
his
companion
had
time
to
realize
what
was
happening
the
door
of
the
shed
was
slammed
to
and
locked
on
the
outside
to
describe
exactly
what
followed
would
be
impossible
as
even
the
principal
actors
themselves
seemed
to
have
but
a
confused
recollection
of
the
part
they
played
those
concerned
however
will
probably
never
forget
diggory
bursting
into
the
room
as
they
sat
finishing
supper
and
striking
every
one
dumb
with
amazement
by
saying
to
blake
please
sir
some
fellows
are
stealing
our
fireworks
and
i
locked
them
up
in
the
shed
and
there
will
still
remain
in
their
minds
memories
of
a
wild
rush
to
the
playground
of
old
noaks
being
peremptorily
ordered
to
clear
out
and
on
attempting
to
bandy
words
with
blake
being
taken
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
chucked
out
of
the
two
philistines
being
conducted
under
a
strong
escort
to
welsby
study
of
a
polite
note
being
dispatched
by
the
latter
to
philips
and
of
the
unmitigated
delight
of
the
birchites
when
hogson
and
noaks
junior
were
delivered
over
into
the
hands
of
fox
and
marched
off
by
that
gentleman
to
take
their
trial
at
horace
house
every
one
was
in
high
spirits
acton
and
diggory
were
made
to
tell
their
story
over
twenty
times
kennedy
and
jacobs
were
at
once
declared
innocent
and
instead
of
being
looked
upon
as
outcasts
came
to
be
regarded
as
martyrs
who
had
suffered
in
a
good
cause
old
noaks
was
clearly
the
culprit
he
volunteered
no
explanation
as
regarded
his
possession
of
a
duplicate
key
to
the
shed
door
and
though
no
attempt
was
made
to
bring
the
charge
home
against
him
there
was
little
doubt
as
to
his
guilt
and
he
was
dismissed
the
next
morning
the
firework
display
came
off
the
following
evening
and
was
a
great
success
every
rocket
or
roman
candle
that
shot
into
the
air
seemed
to
attest
the
final
triumph
of
the
birchites
over
the
philistines
and
was
cheered
accordingly
i
say
final
triumph
for
the
removal
of
young
noaks
and
hogson
from
the
rival
school
caused
a
great
change
for
the
better
among
the
ranks
of
horace
house
the
old
feud
died
out
giving
place
to
a
far
better
spirit
which
was
manifested
each
term
in
the
friendly
manner
in
which
the
teams
met
for
matches
at
cricket
and
football
this
sounds
very
much
like
the
end
of
a
story
but
it
is
not
and
for
a
to
join
this
chapter
to
those
that
follow
we
will
go
forward
for
one
moment
into
the
future
nearly
a
year
later
diggory
and
jack
vance
were
sauntering
arm
in
arm
across
one
of
the
at
ronleigh
college
remember
remarked
the
former
how
that
night
we
caught
the
philistines
bagging
our
fireworks
you
said
i
should
think
now
we
just
about
finished
with
young
noaks
did
i
answered
jack
shrugging
his
shoulders
my
eye
i
ought
to
have
said
we
just
begun
chapter
vii
ronleigh
college
the
first
two
or
three
weeks
of
a
new
boy
life
at
a
big
school
are
as
a
rule
a
dull
and
uneventful
period
which
does
not
furnish
many
incidents
that
are
of
sufficient
interest
to
be
worth
recording
the
triple
alliance
passed
through
the
principal
entrance
to
ronleigh
college
one
afternoon
towards
the
end
of
january
with
no
flourish
of
trumpets
or
beat
of
drums
to
announce
the
fact
of
their
arrival
to
their
one
hundred
and
eighty
odd
schoolfellows
they
were
simply
new
kids
but
though
after
the
fame
they
had
won
at
the
birches
it
was
rather
humiliating
at
first
to
find
themselves
regarded
as
three
nobodies
yet
there
was
some
compensation
in
the
thought
that
just
as
the
smallest
can
point
to
a
flag
covered
with
honours
and
say
my
regiment
so
in
looking
round
at
the
many
things
of
which
ronleians
past
and
present
had
just
reason
to
be
proud
they
could
claim
it
as
our
school
and
feel
that
they
themselves
formed
a
part
however
small
and
insignificant
of
the
institution
the
crowd
of
boys
and
the
maze
of
passages
rooms
and
staircases
were
very
confusing
after
the
quiet
house
at
chatford
but
though
in
this
world
there
is
no
lack
either
of
lame
dogs
or
of
stiles
there
is
also
a
good
supply
of
persons
who
are
ever
ready
to
help
the
former
over
the
latter
and
our
three
friends
were
fortunate
enough
to
fall
in
with
one
of
these
philanthropic
individuals
soon
after
their
arrival
the
stranger
who
was
a
youngster
of
about
their
own
age
with
a
pleasant
face
patted
diggory
on
the
back
in
a
fatherly
manner
and
addressing
the
group
said
well
my
boys
we
a
large
family
at
ronleigh
but
fresh
additions
are
always
welcome
how
did
you
leave
them
all
at
home
quite
well
i
hope
um
ah
just
so
that
what
denson
always
says
continued
the
speaker
without
waiting
for
any
reply
to
his
numerous
questions
you
have
to
go
and
see
him
after
tea
my
name
carton
what
yours
the
three
comrades
introduced
themselves
what
bedroom
are
you
in
number
then
you
in
the
same
one
as
i
and
young
hart
come
for
a
stroll
and
i
show
you
round
the
place
with
carton
acting
as
conductor
the
party
set
out
on
a
tour
of
inspection
it
was
some
time
before
the
could
find
their
way
about
alone
without
turning
down
wrong
passages
or
encroaching
on
forbidden
ground
and
getting
shouted
at
by
irate
seniors
and
ordered
to
come
out
of
that
but
by
the
time
they
had
finished
their
round
and
the
clanging
of
a
big
bell
summoned
them
to
assemble
in
the
for
tea
they
had
been
able
to
form
a
general
idea
as
to
the
geography
of
ronleigh
college
and
a
brief
account
of
their
discoveries
will
be
of
interest
to
the
reader
passing
through
the
central
archway
in
the
block
of
buildings
which
faced
the
road
the
boys
found
themselves
in
a
large
gravelled
quadrangle
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
high
walls
broken
by
what
appeared
at
first
sight
to
be
an
almost
countless
number
of
windows
while
the
red
brick
was
relieved
in
many
places
by
a
thick
growth
of
ivy
that
the
gymnasium
on
the
left
said
carton
and
above
it
are
studies
and
that
row
of
big
windows
on
the
right
with
the
coloured
glass
in
the
top
is
the
big
schoolroom
crossing
the
gravel
they
passed
through
another
archway
in
which
were
two
and
emerged
upon
an
open
space
covered
with
asphalt
upon
which
stood
a
and
two
double
this
formed
but
a
small
corner
of
a
large
level
field
in
which
a
number
of
boys
were
to
be
seen
wandering
about
arm
in
arm
or
standing
chatting
together
in
small
groups
pausing
every
now
and
then
in
their
conversation
to
give
chase
to
a
football
which
was
being
kicked
about
in
an
aimless
fashion
by
a
number
of
their
more
energetic
companions
the
are
up
yet
said
carton
and
this
is
only
called
the
junior
field
the
one
beyond
is
where
the
big
fellows
play
the
pavilion
is
over
the
hedge
there
with
the
flagstaff
by
the
side
of
it
that
the
match
ground
and
there
room
for
another
game
besides
where
do
all
the
fellows
go
when
they
are
out
of
doors
asked
diggory
well
the
sixth
all
have
studies
then
comes
remove
and
those
chaps
have
a
room
to
themselves
all
the
rest
have
desks
in
the
big
school
and
you
hang
about
there
though
of
course
if
you
like
there
the
gymnasium
or
the
that
where
a
lot
of
fellows
spend
most
of
their
time
what
sort
of
a
place
is
that
oh
it
where
the
are
kept
come
along
we
go
there
next
they
passed
once
more
through
the
double
doors
and
were
crossing
the
quadrangle
when
a
certain
incident
attracted
their
notice
unimportant
in
itself
but
indicating
a
strong
contrast
in
the
manner
of
life
at
ronleigh
to
what
they
had
always
been
accustomed
to
at
the
birches
a
youngster
was
tearing
up
a
piece
of
paper
and
scattering
the
fragments
about
on
the
gravel
hi
you
there
cried
a
voice
pick
that
up
what
mean
by
making
that
mess
here
the
small
boy
grabbed
up
the
bits
of
paper
stuffed
them
in
his
pocket
and
hurried
away
towards
the
schoolroom
is
that
one
of
the
masters
asked
mugford
no
answered
carton
that
oaks
he
one
of
the
prefects
do
you
see
he
got
a
blue
tassel
to
his
but
what
a
prefect
whew
laughed
the
other
you
soon
find
out
if
you
play
the
fool
and
do
mind
what
you
about
why
there
are
fourteen
of
them
all
fellows
in
the
sixth
and
they
keep
order
and
give
you
lines
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
why
i
thought
it
was
only
masters
did
that
said
jack
vance
well
you
find
the
prefects
do
it
here
answered
carton
and
when
they
tell
you
to
do
a
thing
i
advise
you
to
look
alive
and
do
it
for
they
do
reckon
to
speak
twice
the
evening
passed
quickly
enough
after
tea
came
an
interview
with
the
in
his
study
and
then
what
was
perhaps
a
still
more
trying
ordeal
a
long
spell
of
sitting
in
the
big
schoolroom
answering
an
incessant
fire
of
questions
such
as
what
your
name
where
come
from
etc
at
length
the
signal
was
given
for
passing
on
to
bed
and
the
triple
alliance
were
not
sorry
to
gain
the
shelter
of
no
dormitory
the
room
contained
seven
other
beds
besides
their
own
two
of
which
were
as
yet
still
vacant
waiting
the
arrival
of
boys
who
had
not
turned
up
on
the
first
day
the
remainder
were
occupied
by
a
couple
of
other
and
three
oldsters
carton
hart
and
bayley
it
was
very
different
from
the
cosy
little
bedrooms
at
the
birches
but
the
three
friends
were
glad
to
be
allowed
to
undress
in
peace
and
quiet
and
had
scrambled
safely
into
bed
some
time
before
the
prefect
put
in
an
appearance
to
turn
out
the
light
i
tell
you
what
said
hart
a
few
moments
later
you
new
kids
may
think
yourselves
lucky
that
you
in
a
quiet
room
for
a
start
i
know
when
i
came
first
there
used
to
be
christenings
and
all
kinds
of
humbug
what
was
that
asked
diggory
why
fellows
used
always
to
christen
you
with
a
nickname
they
stuck
your
head
in
a
basin
and
poured
water
over
you
and
if
you
struggled
you
got
it
all
down
your
back
yes
continued
carton
and
they
hid
your
clothes
and
had
and
all
sorts
of
foolery
that
was
in
old
was
the
prefect
for
that
passage
and
he
does
care
what
fellows
do
but
allingford
put
a
stop
to
almost
all
that
kind
of
thing
captain
of
the
school
and
he
always
awfully
down
on
anything
of
that
sort
by
the
time
breakfast
was
over
on
the
following
morning
diggory
and
his
two
companions
were
beginning
to
recover
a
little
from
their
first
state
of
bewilderment
amid
their
strange
surroundings
they
donned
the
school
cap
of
black
flannel
with
the
crest
worked
in
silk
upon
the
front
and
went
out
to
enjoy
some
fresh
air
and
sunshine
in
the
playground
it
was
a
bright
frosty
day
and
the
whole
place
seemed
full
of
life
and
activity
there
was
plenty
to
engage
their
attention
and
much
that
was
new
and
singular
after
their
comparatively
quiet
playground
at
the
birches
but
whatever
there
was
to
awaken
their
interest
out
of
doors
a
thing
was
destined
to
happen
during
their
first
morning
school
which
would
be
a
still
greater
surprise
than
anything
they
had
yet
encountered
during
their
short
residence
at
ronleigh
at
nine
the
clanging
of
the
big
bell
summoned
them
to
the
general
assembly
in
the
big
schoolroom
they
took
their
places
at
a
back
desk
pointed
out
to
them
by
the
master
on
duty
and
sat
watching
the
stream
of
boys
that
poured
in
through
the
open
doors
wondering
how
long
it
would
take
them
to
become
acquainted
with
the
names
of
such
a
multitude
the
forms
passed
on
in
their
usual
order
and
the
new
boys
were
conducted
to
a
vacant
classroom
where
they
received
a
set
of
examination
papers
which
were
intended
to
test
the
amount
of
their
knowledge
and
determine
the
position
in
which
they
were
to
start
work
on
the
following
day
jack
vance
diggory
and
mugford
sat
together
at
the
first
desk
just
in
front
of
the
master
table
and
were
soon
busy
in
proving
their
previous
acquaintance
with
the
latin
grammar
presently
the
door
opened
and
a
voice
which
they
at
once
recognized
as
denson
said
ellesby
may
i
trouble
you
to
step
here
for
a
moment
none
of
the
trio
raised
their
eyes
from
their
work
there
was
a
muttered
conversation
in
the
passage
and
then
the
door
was
once
more
closed
the
master
returned
to
his
desk
dipped
his
pen
in
the
ink
and
addressing
some
one
at
the
back
of
the
room
inquired
what
did
denson
say
your
name
was
noaks
sir
the
triple
alliance
gave
a
simultaneous
start
as
though
they
had
received
an
electric
shock
and
their
heads
turned
round
like
three
weathercocks
there
sure
enough
at
the
back
desk
of
all
sat
the
late
leader
of
the
philistines
with
a
rather
sheepish
expression
on
his
face
somewhat
similar
to
the
one
it
had
worn
when
the
marauders
from
horace
house
had
been
ushered
into
welsby
study
jack
vance
looked
at
mugford
and
mugford
looked
at
diggory
well
jiggered
whispered
the
latter
and
once
more
returned
to
his
examination
paper
at
eleven
there
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
interval
being
still
as
it
were
strangers
in
a
strange
land
the
three
friends
kept
pretty
close
together
they
were
walking
arm
in
arm
about
the
quadrangle
giving
expression
to
their
astonishment
at
this
latest
arrival
at
ronleigh
when
diggory
suddenly
exclaimed
look
out
here
he
comes
after
so
many
encounters
of
a
decidedly
hostile
nature
it
was
difficult
to
meet
their
old
enemy
on
neutral
ground
without
some
feeling
of
embarrassment
young
noaks
however
walked
up
cool
as
a
cucumber
and
holding
out
his
hand
said
hullo
you
fellows
who
have
thought
of
seeing
you
here
how
are
you
the
three
boys
returned
the
salutation
in
a
manner
which
to
say
the
least
was
not
very
cordial
and
made
some
attempt
to
pass
on
their
way
but
the
refused
to
see
that
he
was
not
wanted
and
insisted
on
taking
mugford
arm
and
accompanying
them
on
their
stroll
i
say
he
continued
addressing
jack
vance
were
you
at
todderton
these
holidays
i
do
think
i
saw
you
once
the
last
time
i
saw
you
returned
jack
in
rather
a
bitter
tone
was
when
you
came
to
spoil
our
fireworks
and
we
collared
you
in
the
shed
noaks
clinched
his
fist
and
for
a
moment
his
brow
darkened
the
next
instant
however
he
laughed
as
though
the
recollection
of
the
incident
afforded
him
an
immense
amount
of
amusement
ha
ha
yes
awful
joke
that
was
it
almost
as
good
as
the
time
when
that
fool
of
a
master
of
yours
lake
or
blake
or
whatever
you
call
him
had
me
sent
off
the
field
so
that
you
could
win
the
match
it
was
no
such
thing
answered
jack
you
know
very
well
why
it
was
blake
interfered
and
he
not
a
fool
but
a
jolly
good
sort
oh
do
get
angry
returned
the
other
i
sure
i
should
fly
into
a
wax
if
you
called
fox
or
old
phillips
a
fool
i
got
sick
of
that
beastly
little
school
as
i
expect
you
did
of
yours
and
so
i
made
my
uncle
send
me
hullo
i
suppose
that
the
bell
for
going
back
to
work
see
you
again
later
on
i
say
whispered
diggory
as
soon
as
they
had
regained
their
seat
in
the
i
vote
we
give
that
chap
the
cold
shoulder
the
following
morning
the
three
friends
heard
their
names
read
out
as
forming
part
of
the
third
form
to
which
their
friend
carton
already
belonged
young
noaks
was
placed
in
the
upper
fourth
and
they
were
not
destined
therefore
to
have
him
as
a
the
third
form
at
ronleigh
had
for
some
reason
or
other
received
the
title
of
the
happy
family
they
certainly
were
an
amusing
lot
of
little
animals
and
diggory
and
his
companions
coming
into
the
classroom
rather
late
and
before
the
entrance
of
the
master
saw
them
for
the
first
time
to
full
advantage
out
of
the
juveniles
present
only
about
six
seemed
to
be
in
their
proper
places
one
young
gentleman
sitting
close
to
the
blackboard
cried
powder
sir
and
straightway
scrubbed
his
neighbour
face
with
a
very
chalky
duster
the
latter
by
way
of
retaliation
smote
the
former
pile
of
books
from
the
desk
on
to
the
ground
a
little
attention
which
was
immediately
returned
by
boy
number
one
while
as
they
bent
down
to
pick
up
their
scattered
possessions
a
third
party
sitting
on
the
form
behind
made
playful
attempts
to
tread
upon
their
fingers
two
rival
factions
in
the
rear
of
the
room
were
waging
war
with
paper
darts
while
a
small
boy
whose
tangled
hair
and
disordered
attire
gave
him
the
appearance
as
the
saying
goes
of
having
been
dragged
through
a
backwards
rapped
vigorously
with
his
knuckles
upon
the
master
table
and
inquired
loudly
how
many
more
times
he
was
to
say
silence
the
entrance
of
the
three
caused
a
false
alarm
and
in
a
moment
every
one
was
in
his
proper
seat
bother
it
cried
the
small
boy
who
had
bumped
his
knee
rushing
from
the
table
to
his
place
why
did
you
make
more
noise
when
you
came
in
but
i
thought
you
were
asking
for
silence
answered
diggory
shut
up
and
do
answer
back
when
you
are
spoken
to
by
a
prefect
retorted
the
small
boy
look
here
you
have
written
your
name
on
watford
they
must
must
they
maxton
he
added
turning
to
a
boy
who
sat
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
back
seats
of
course
they
must
answered
maxton
who
with
both
elbows
on
the
desk
was
blowing
subdued
railway
whistles
through
his
hands
every
new
fellow
has
to
write
his
name
on
that
little
slate
on
table
and
he
enters
them
from
there
into
his
i
head
boy
and
i
got
to
see
you
do
it
look
sharp
or
he
be
here
in
a
minute
and
there
be
a
row
diggory
vance
and
mugford
hastily
signed
their
names
one
under
the
other
upon
the
slate
there
was
a
good
deal
of
tittering
while
they
did
so
but
as
a
new
boy
is
laughed
at
for
nearly
everything
he
does
they
took
no
notice
of
it
and
had
hardly
got
back
to
their
places
when
the
master
entered
the
room
and
the
work
began
in
earnest
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
boys
were
busy
with
a
latin
exercise
when
silence
was
broken
by
a
shuffle
and
an
exclamation
from
the
back
desk
you
again
maxton
said
the
master
looking
up
with
a
frown
i
suppose
you
are
determined
to
idle
away
your
time
and
remain
bottom
of
the
class
this
term
as
you
were
last
i
shall
put
your
name
down
for
some
extra
work
let
see
he
continued
taking
up
the
slate
i
appear
to
have
three
boys
names
down
already
and
what
the
meaning
of
this
this
is
not
my
writing
how
came
these
names
here
please
sir
faltered
mugford
we
put
them
there
ourselves
put
them
there
yourselves
what
want
to
put
your
names
down
on
my
punishment
slate
for
i
suppose
some
one
told
you
to
did
they
please
sir
answered
diggory
warily
we
thought
we
had
to
so
that
you
might
have
our
names
to
enter
in
your
there
was
a
burst
of
laughter
but
that
answer
went
a
long
way
towards
setting
the
alliance
on
a
good
footing
with
their
that
young
trevanock
the
right
sort
said
maxton
and
so
are
the
others
i
thought
they
sneak
about
that
slate
but
they
did
noaks
junior
on
the
other
hand
was
destined
to
find
that
he
was
not
going
to
carry
everything
before
him
at
ronleigh
as
he
had
done
among
the
small
fry
at
horace
house
the
upper
fourth
voted
him
a
bounder
and
nicknamed
him
moke
after
morning
school
he
repeated
his
attempt
to
ally
himself
with
his
former
foes
but
the
result
was
decidedly
unsatisfactory
down
in
the
a
apartment
boarded
off
from
the
gymnasium
jack
vance
was
serving
out
a
ration
of
to
a
select
party
consisting
of
his
two
chums
and
carton
when
the
strolled
up
and
joined
himself
to
the
group
hullo
he
said
are
you
chaps
having
a
feed
remember
that
we
bagged
from
one
of
your
kids
at
chatford
ha
ha
it
was
a
lark
i
do
see
it
much
of
a
lark
to
bag
what
does
belong
to
you
muttered
diggory
what
that
you
say
nothing
for
you
to
hear
returned
the
other
i
do
know
if
waiting
about
here
to
get
some
cake
but
i
sure
i
never
invited
you
to
come
look
here
do
be
cheeky
answered
noaks
if
you
think
i
want
to
make
friends
with
a
lot
of
impudent
young
monkeys
like
you
all
i
can
say
is
you
jolly
well
mistaken
and
so
saying
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
i
say
trevanock
said
carton
two
days
later
that
fellow
noaks
has
found
a
friend
at
last
he
picked
up
with
mouler
they
make
a
nice
pair
i
should
say
mouler
was
nearly
expelled
last
term
for
telling
lies
to
ellesby
about
some
cribs
noaks
certainly
seemed
to
have
discovered
a
chum
in
the
black
sheep
of
the
upper
fourth
and
the
triple
alliance
began
to
congratulate
themselves
that
he
would
trouble
them
no
further
in
a
big
school
like
ronleigh
college
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
everybody
to
go
his
own
way
without
fear
of
running
his
head
into
people
whom
he
wished
to
avoid
our
three
friends
however
seemed
fated
to
find
in
the
person
of
noaks
junior
a
perpetual
and
cause
of
disquietude
and
annoyance
they
had
no
sooner
succeeded
in
setting
him
at
a
distance
when
an
incident
occurred
which
brought
them
once
more
into
violent
collision
with
the
enemy
the
pavilion
which
has
already
been
mentioned
as
standing
on
the
match
ground
was
a
handsome
wooden
structure
surrounded
by
some
low
palings
in
front
of
which
was
a
small
oblong
patch
of
gravel
on
the
second
saturday
morning
of
the
term
noaks
and
mouler
were
lounging
across
this
open
space
when
oaks
the
prefect
emerged
from
the
pavilion
carrying
in
his
hand
a
pot
of
paint
he
had
been
mixing
for
the
which
were
just
being
put
up
on
reaching
the
paling
he
suddenly
ejaculated
bother
i
forgotten
the
brush
and
resting
the
can
on
the
top
of
the
little
hurried
back
up
the
short
flight
of
steps
and
disappeared
through
the
open
door
i
say
there
a
good
said
noaks
nodding
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
paint
umph
should
like
to
try
answered
mouler
why
not
because
oaks
would
jolly
well
punch
both
our
heads
well
here
a
new
kid
coming
let
set
him
on
to
do
it
you
speak
to
him
he
knows
me
his
name
mugford
the
two
cronies
both
picked
up
a
handful
of
stones
and
began
throwing
at
the
can
taking
good
care
that
their
shots
should
fly
wide
of
the
mark
mugford
who
as
we
have
already
seen
was
not
blessed
with
the
sharpest
of
wits
paused
for
a
moment
to
watch
the
contest
the
paint
had
been
mixed
in
an
old
and
at
first
sight
it
certainly
seemed
to
have
been
put
on
the
post
for
the
sole
purpose
of
being
knocked
off
again
hullo
you
new
kid
exclaimed
mouler
look
here
we
want
a
chap
for
the
third
eleven
next
season
a
fellow
who
can
throw
straight
come
along
and
let
see
if
you
can
hit
that
old
can
it
certainly
looked
easy
enough
and
mugford
pleased
at
being
taken
some
notice
of
by
a
boy
in
the
upper
fourth
picked
up
some
pebbles
and
joined
in
the
bombardment
the
second
shot
brought
the
tin
down
with
a
great
clatter
and
a
flood
of
white
paint
spread
all
over
the
trim
little
pathway
at
the
same
instant
oaks
dashed
down
the
steps
boiling
with
rage
confound
you
he
cried
who
did
that
i
did
answered
mugford
half
crying
i
thought
it
was
empty
thought
it
was
empty
why
did
you
look
you
young
blockhead
cried
the
prefect
catching
the
small
boy
by
the
arm
while
noaks
and
mouler
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
things
would
probably
have
gone
hard
with
the
unfortunate
mugford
if
at
that
moment
a
fifth
party
had
not
arrived
on
the
scene
the
who
from
the
show
of
whisker
at
the
side
of
his
face
and
the
tone
of
authority
in
which
he
spoke
seemed
to
be
one
of
the
masters
was
tall
and
muscular
with
the
bronze
of
a
season
cricketing
still
upon
his
cheeks
and
neck
stop
a
minute
oaks
he
said
i
happened
to
see
this
little
game
let
hear
what
the
kid
got
to
say
for
himself
in
faltering
tones
mugford
told
his
story
without
a
word
the
stranger
stepped
up
to
mouler
and
dealt
him
a
sounding
box
on
the
ear
there
he
said
take
that
for
your
trouble
and
now
cut
off
down
town
and
buy
a
fresh
pot
of
paint
out
of
your
own
pocket
and
do
it
jolly
quick
as
for
you
he
added
turning
to
noaks
get
a
spade
out
of
that
place
under
the
pavilion
and
clean
up
this
path
if
you
a
new
fellow
i
serve
you
the
same
look
out
in
future
and
you
look
out
too
muttered
noaks
glancing
at
mugford
with
a
fierce
expression
on
his
face
as
the
two
seniors
moved
off
you
beastly
young
sneak
the
first
chance
i
get
i
give
you
the
best
licking
you
ever
had
in
your
life
old
mug
is
rather
a
fool
remarked
jack
vance
to
diggory
a
few
hours
later
he
ought
to
have
seen
through
that
but
we
must
stand
by
him
because
of
the
triple
alliance
noaks
is
sure
to
try
to
set
on
him
the
first
chance
he
gets
yes
answered
diggory

squalls
chapter

third
form
oratory
at
the
end
of
the
first
fortnight
our
three
friends
had
begun
to
find
their
feet
at
ronleigh
and
the
sense
of
being
outsiders
in
everything
was
gradually
wearing
off
as
they
grew
more
intimate
with
their
schoolfellows
jack
vance
and
diggory
soon
became
popular
members
of
the
happy
family
and
their
loyalty
to
mugford
caused
the
latter
path
to
be
much
smoother
than
it
probably
would
have
been
had
he
been
compelled
to
tread
it
alone
carton
turned
out
a
capital
fellow
rathson
the
small
boy
mentioned
in
the
previous
chapter
and
who
generally
went
by
the
name
of
rats
took
a
great
fancy
to
jack
while
maxton
repeated
his
assertion
that
young
trevanock
was
the
right
sort
and
as
a
further
mark
of
his
favour
presented
the
with
a
moleskin
of
his
own
curing
which
looked
very
nice
but
as
rats
put
it
smelt
rather
fruity
but
it
was
not
in
the
third
form
only
that
diggory
began
to
find
friends
for
by
a
lucky
chance
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
make
a
good
impression
on
the
minds
of
the
great
men
who
as
a
rule
took
no
further
notice
of
the
small
fry
than
to
exact
from
them
a
certain
amount
of
obedience
or
in
default
a
certain
number
of
lines
or
other
impots
one
morning
soon
after
breakfast
a
little
group
was
gathered
round
carton
desk
in
the
big
discussing
the
value
of
some
foreign
stamps
when
a
small
boy
came
up
to
them
saying
is
trevanock
here
well
acton
wants
you
now
at
once
in
his
study
hullo
said

looking
up
from
the
sheet
of
specimens
in
front
of
him
hullo
diggy
what
have
you
been
up
to
i
have
been
doing
anything
answered
the
other
what
do
you
think
he
wants
me
for
i
do
know
but
it
sounds
rather
like
getting
a
licking
at
all
events
you
better
hurry
up
prefects
do
thank
you
for
keeping
them
waiting
his
is
the
third
door
on
the
right
as
you
go
down
the
passage
diggory
hastened
to
obey
the
summons
wondering
what
it
could
mean
he
found
the
door
and
in
answer
to
the
loud
come
in
which
greeted
his
knock
turned
the
handle
and
found
himself
for
the
first
time
inside
one
of
the
sixth
form
studies
it
was
a
small
square
room
and
looked
very
cosy
and
comfortable
with
its
red
bookshelf
and
many
little
that
adorned
the
walls
and
mantelpiece
an
array
of
silver
cups
several
photographs
of
cricket
and
football
teams
and
a
miscellaneous
pile
of
bats
indian
clubs
standing
in
one
corner
all
spoke
of
the
athlete
while
carelessly
thrown
down
on
the
top
of
a
cupboard
was
an
article
for
the
possession
of
which
many
a
boy
would
have
bartered
the
whole
of
his
worldly
wealth
a
bit
of
worn
blue
velvet
and
the
tarnished
remnant
of
what
had
once
been
a
gold
tassel
the
footer
cap
of
ronleigh
college
but
it
was
not
so
much
the
furniture
as
the
occupants
of
the
study
that
attracted
diggory
attention
john
acton
a
tall
wiry
fellow
who
looked
as
though
his
whole
body
was
as
hard
and
tough
as
was
standing
leaning
on
the
end
of
the
mantelpiece
talking
to
another
of
the
seniors
who
sat
sprawling
in
a
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
while
seated
at
the
table
turning
over
the
leaves
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
big
manuscript
book
was
no
less
a
personage
than
allingford
the
school
captain
i
do
understand
a
bit
what
coming
to
the
football
leader
was
saying
i
was
rather
chummy
with
him
when
we
were
in
the
fifth
and
he
was
all
right
then
but
now
he
seems
to
be
running
to
seed
as
fast
as
he
can
and
i
believe
it
a
great
deal
that
fellow
hullo
youngster
what
want
i
was
told
you
wanted
to
see
me
said
diggory
nervously
oh
yes
you
were
at
the
birches
that
school
near
chatford
you
well
i
want
to
hear
about
that
love
affair
my
young
brother
had
with
the
old
chap
it
was
an
awful
joke
added
the
speaker
addressing
his
companions
he
was
about
fourteen
and
she
a
woman
and
he
was
awfully
gone
i
can
tell
how
did
he
pop
the
question
he
wrote
answered
diggory
we
tossed
up
whether
he
should
do
that
or
speak
there
was
a
burst
of
laughter
did
you
see
the
letter
yes
what
did
he
say
i
ca
tell
you
why
not
do
you
remember
yes
but
he
only
showed
me
the
letter
on
condition
i
would
ever
tell
any
one
what
was
in
it
oh
that
all
rot
you
can
tell
me
i
his
brother
come
out
with
it
it
was
an
awful
thing
to
beard
the
lion
in
his
den
for
a
new
boy
to
face
so
great
a
personage
as
the
football
captain
and
refuse
to
do
as
he
was
told
diggory
shifted
uneasily
from
one
foot
to
another
and
then
glancing
up
he
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
allingford
was
gazing
at
him
across
the
table
with
a
curious
expression
which
somehow
gave
him
fresh
encouragement
to
persist
in
his
refusal
to
disclose
the
contents
of
his
former
friend
i
ca
tell
you
he
repeated
it
was
a
promise
you
know
the
ronleigh
captain
laughed
well
done
he
said
i
wish
some
other
fellows
were
a
bit
more
careful
to
keep
their
acton
you
beggar
you
swore
you
keep
up
this
register
for
me
and
nothing
entered
for
last
term
oh
bother
you
ally
exclaimed
the
other
what
a
you
are
hullo
there
the
bell
here
kid
stick
those
two
oranges
in
your
pocket
go
diggory
left
the
room
having
gained
something
else
besides
the
two
oranges
for
as
he
closed
the
door
allingford
laughed
again
and
rising
from
his
chair
said
he
a
stanch
little
beggar
i
think
i
keep
an
eye
on
him
the
subject
of
this
remark
hurried
away
and
had
just
joined
the
crowd
of
boys
who
were
thronging
into
the
big
school
for
assembly
when
some
one
took
hold
of
his
arm
and
glancing
round
he
was
startled
to
see
jack
vance
looking
very
excited
and
dishevelled
and
mopping
his
mouth
with
a
handkerchief
i
say
exclaimed
the
latter
have
you
seen
mugford
no
what
the
matter
what
have
you
done
to
your
mouth
why
i
had
a
beastly
row
with
noaks
i
you
after
school
no
tell
me
now
cried
diggory
pulling
his
companion
aside
into
a
corner
by
the
door
quick
what
was
it
why
he
pounced
down
on
mugford
out
there
by
the
and
began
twisting
his
arm
and
saying
he
pay
him
out
for
that
business
i
went
to
the
rescue
and
the
beast
hit
me
with
the
back
of
his
hand
here
on
the
mouth
i
told
him
he
was
a
cad
and
said
something
about
his
father
being
only
a
and
having
stolen
our
things
i
sorry
now
for
it
was
rather
a
low
thing
to
do
but
i
was
in
such
a
wax
i
did
think
what
i
was
saying
mouler
was
standing
by
and
he
heard
it
and
laughed
and
noaks
looked
as
if
he
have
killed
me
i
believe
he
would
have
knocked
me
down
only
rowlands
the
prefect
came
up
and
stopped
the
row
there
was
no
time
for
any
further
details
and
the
two
boys
had
to
rush
away
to
their
seats
in
order
to
escape
being
marked
as
late
one
thing
was
certain
that
the
triple
alliance
were
once
more
embroiled
in
a
quarrel
with
their
ancient
foe
the
former
leader
of
the
philistines
and
they
knew
enough
of
their
adversary
character
to
feel
sure
that
he
would
not
pass
over
an
event
of
this
kind
without
some
attempt
at
revenge
it
is
probable
that
if
this
had
happened
at
horace
house
jack
vance
would
have
received
a
good
licking
as
soon
as
the
classes
were
dismissed
but
a
few
very
plain
and
forcible
words
spoken
by
rowlands
on
the
subject
of
knocking
small
boys
about
caused
noaks
to
postpone
his
retaliation
look
here
he
said
meeting
jack
vance
in
the
quadrangle
during
the
interval
just
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
about
me
and
my
father
i
got
two
or
three
accounts
to
settle
with
you
chaps
already
just
mind
what
you
up
to
he
clinched
his
fist
as
though
about
to
strike
then
with
an
ugly
scowl
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
it
must
have
been
about
three
days
after
this
encounter
with
noaks
that
our
three
friends
were
called
upon
to
attend
a
mass
meeting
of
the
third
form
to
consider
the
advisability
of
starting
a
periodical
in
opposition
to
the
school
magazine
important
events
connected
with
a
later
period
of
their
life
at
ronleigh
render
it
necessary
that
we
should
not
linger
too
long
over
the
account
of
their
first
term
but
some
mention
however
brief
should
certainly
be
made
of
the
memorable
gathering
to
which
we
have
referred
a
notice
pinned
on
to
the
and
pulled
down
as
soon
as
watford
entered
the
classroom
announced
the
project
in
the
following
words
notice
a
meeting
will
be
held
in
the
lab
directly
after
dinner
to
make
plans
for
starting
a
magazine
in
opposition
to
all
members
of
the
third
form
are
specially
requested
to
attend
fletcher
ii
j
a
bibbs
you
must
come
said
rats
to
diggory
it
be
an
awful
lark
but
what
it
all
about
oh
you
hear
when
you
get
there
it
fletcher
idea
he
wants
to
start
a
new
magazine
eastfield
who
edits
is
cousin
so
maxton
going
to
interrupt
and
get
some
other
fellows
to
do
the
same
i
going
to
be
part
of
the
opposition
added
the
youthful
rats
beaming
with
delight
and
i
have
got
a
whole
heap
of
paper
bags
i
going
to
burst
while
fletcher
speaking
the
old
lab
as
it
was
called
was
a
small
brick
building
which
stood
on
one
side
of
the
asphalt
playground
a
new
laboratory
having
recently
been
fitted
up
elsewhere
the
former
one
was
for
the
time
being
unused
it
was
not
more
than
about
fifteen
feet
long
by
seven
or
eight
feet
wide
and
as
the
happy
family
mustered
in
force
the
place
was
crowded
to
overflowing
the
door
having
been
closed
fletcher
two
mounted
a
low
stone
sink
which
ran
along
the
end
wall
and
from
this
platform
commenced
to
address
the
assembly
gentlemen
we
met
here
as
you
know
to
talk
over
starting
a
fresh
magazine
is
a
beastly
swindle
and
it
high
time
we
had
something
different
a
voice
no
is
and
the
bursting
of
a
paper
bag
you
shut
up
there
i
say
it
is
a
swindle
they
give
any
account
of
that
fourth
eleven
match
against
robertson
second
and
they
made
fun
of
us
in
the
gossip
and
said
that
in
happy
family
there
was
a
preponderance
of
monkey
so
there
is
and
you
it
laughter
and
another
explosion
what
i
propose
is
that
we
start
a
manuscript
magazine
for
the
third
form
and
that
every
fellow
promise
to
take
that
and
never
to
buy
a
copy
of
the
other
we
might
pass
it
round
and
charge
a
penny
each
to
look
at
it
will
you
all
subscribe
no
one
spoke
the
silence
only
being
broken
by
the
sound
of
rats
blowing
up
another
bag
which
caused
a
fresh
burst
of
laughter
will
you
all
subscribe
once
more
demanded
the
speaker
there
were
mingled
cries
of
yes
and
no
and
a
stentorian
yell
of
no
you
cuckoo
of
course
we
wo
from
maxton
and
another
explosion
look
here
young
if
you
burst
any
more
of
those
bags
i
come
down
and
burst
your
i
forgot
to
say
gentlemen
that
bibbs
has
promised
to
assist
in
editing
the
paper
and
i
will
now
call
upon
him
to
give
you
an
account
of
what
it
will
contain
bibbs
the
third
form
genius
was
regarded
by
every
one
as
a
huge
joke
and
the
very
mention
of
his
name
caused
a
fresh
burst
of
merriment
he
was
a
boy
quick
and
clever
enough
in
some
things
and
equally
dull
and
stupid
in
others
the
announcement
that
he
would
address
the
meeting
had
no
sooner
been
made
than
half
a
dozen
willing
pairs
of
hands
seized
and
hoisted
him
on
to
the
platform
though
no
sooner
had
he
attained
this
exalted
position
than
two
or
three
voices
ordered
him
in
a
peremptory
manner
to
come
down
the
greater
part
of
the
audience
not
caring
the
toss
of
a
button
whether
fletcher
started
his
magazine
or
not
but
thinking
that
it
was
rather
good
fun
to
interrupt
the
proceedings
now
joined
the
opposition
and
the
unfortunate
bibbs
was
subjected
to
a
brisk
fire
of
chaff
one
facetious
standing
close
to
the
sink
offered
to
sell
him
by
auction
and
hammering
on
the
stones
with
the
fragment
of
a
bat
handle
knocked
him
down
for
threepence
to
another
joker
who
said
do
for
a
sing
a
song
bibbs
cried
one
voice
where
your
asked
another
what
are
you
grinning
at
demanded
a
third
while
the
object
of
these
pleasantries
stood
with
a
vacant
smile
upon
his
face
nervously
fumbling
with
his
go
on
cried
fletcher
who
had
descended
from
the
platform
to
make
room
for
his
colleague
say
something
you
fool
the
magazine
is
to
be
written
on
paper
began
bibbs
and
had
only
got
thus
far
when
he
was
interrupted
by
a
perfect
salvo
of
paper
bags
which
little
rats
discharged
in
quick
succession
with
an
exclamation
of
wrath
fletcher
made
a
dive
in
the
direction
of
the
offender
and
in
a
moment
the
whole
gathering
was
in
a
state
of
confusion
the
majority
of
those
present
siding
with
rats
began
to
hustle
fletcher
while
two
gentlemen
having
dragged
bibbs
from
his
perch
jumped
up
in
his
stead
and
began
to
execute
a
in
the
midst
of
this
commotion
maxton
elbowed
his
way
through
the
crush
and
having
pushed
the
two
boys
off
the
sink
mounted
it
himself
crying
look
here
i
going
to
speak
just
you
listen
a
minute
the
reason
why
bibbs
wants
to
start
a
new
magazine
is
because
he
wrote
a
novel
once
and
sent
it
to
to
come
out
so
much
each
month
and
they
would
have
it
shut
up
maxton
cried
fletcher
rushing
to
the
spot
you
only
come
here
on
purpose
to
interrupt
let
turn
him
out
yes
turn
him
out
echoed
the
audience
who
by
this
time
were
just
in
the
spirit
for
ragging
and
would
have
ejected
friend
or
foe
alike
for
the
sport
of
the
thing
turn
him
out
the
two
being
quite
ready
to
avenge
the
interruption
of
their
performance
formed
themselves
into
a
and
carried
the
platform
by
assault
maxton
struggling
all
the
way
was
dragged
to
the
door
and
cast
out
into
the
playground
most
of
the
restless
spirits
in
the
audience
requiring
a
short
to
recover
their
wind
after
the
tussle
there
followed
a
few
moments
quiet
which
fletcher
immediately
took
advantage
of
to
mount
the
sink
and
resume
the
business
of
the
meeting
the
magazine
he
began
is
going
to
be
written
on
paper
any
one
who
likes
can
contribute
and
it
going
to
be
more
especially
a
paper
for
the
third
form
the
speaker
went
on
to
show
that
the
periodical
was
destined
to
supply
a
want
ignored
the
doings
of
boys
in
the
lower
half
of
the
school
and
returned
their
contributions
with
insulting
suggestions
pencilled
on
the
margins
that
the
authors
should
devote
some
of
their
spare
time
and
energy
to
the
study
of
their
english
grammars
and
third
form
as
it
was
to
be
called
would
recognize
the
fact
that
junior
boys
had
as
much
right
to
be
heard
as
seniors
and
would
afford
them
the
opportunity
of
airing
their
views
on
any
subject
they
chose
to
bring
forward
fletcher
had
barely
time
to
proceed
thus
far
with
his
speech
when
an
alarming
interruption
occurred
which
put
an
immediate
stop
to
his
further
utterance
nearly
at
the
top
of
the
end
wall
there
had
formerly
been
a
ventilator
this
for
one
reason
or
another
had
been
removed
and
in
the
brickwork
an
open
space
about
a
foot
square
had
been
left
a
hissing
noise
was
suddenly
heard
outside
and
the
next
moment
a
stream
of
water
shot
through
the
aperture
and
descended
in
a
perfect
deluge
on
the
heads
of
the
company
the
fact
was
that
maxton
ever
a
reckless
young
villain
had
discovered
a
hose
fixed
to
one
of
the
mains
close
to
the
building
and
had
immediately
seized
upon
it
as
an
instrument
wherewith
to
wreak
vengeance
on
his
companions
for
having
turned
him
out
of
the
meeting
words
can
not
describe
the
uproar
and
confusion
which
followed
as
one
man
the
whole
assembly
made
for
the
door
but
only
to
find
it
fastened
on
the
outside
the
water
flew
all
over
the
small
building
drenching
every
one
in
turn
some
howled
some
laughed
and
only
bibbs
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
creep
under
the
sink
which
afforded
a
certain
amount
of
shelter
from
the
falling
flood
the
deluge
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
and
an
instant
later
the
door
was
flung
open
and
the
figure
of
a
sixth
form
boy
was
seen
barring
the
exit
now
then
he
demanded
what
are
you
youngsters
making
this
awful
row
for
i
a
jolly
good
mind
to
take
all
your
names
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
fletcher
voice
was
heard
exclaiming
oh
it
only
old
he
all
right
here
not
so
fast
answered
the
prefect
blocking
up
the
doorway
as
some
boys
tried
to
escape
what
are
you
chaps
doing
in
here
i
thought
you
been
told
to
keep
out
the
originator
of
the
meeting
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
taking
hold
of
the
big
fellow
arm
in
a
familiar
manner
said
oh
it
all
right
old
chap
we
just
came
inside
and
some
one
squirted
water
all
over
us
and
that
why
we
shouted
but
we
do
it
again
oh
but
it
is
all
right
returned
the
other
if
i
find
any
of
you
in
here
again
i
help
you
out
with
the
toe
of
my
boot
go
on
let
you
off
this
once
the
crowd
rushed
forth
and
quickly
dispersed
that
thurston
seems
an
awful
decent
chap
said
diggory
i
think
he
let
us
off
so
easily
he
all
right
as
long
as
you
do
cross
him
answered
carton
he
used
to
be
pretty
strict
but
he
does
seem
to
care
now
what
fellows
do
he
very
thick
with
fletcher
brother
that
one
reason
why
he
did
do
anything
just
now
but
i
can
tell
you
he
a
nasty
chap
to
deal
with
when
he
in
a
wax
the
prefect
locked
the
empty
building
and
turning
on
his
heel
caught
sight
of
our
three
friends
who
were
standing
close
by
waiting
for
rats
hullo
you
new
kids
what
are
you
called
the
usual
answer
was
given
and
thurston
passed
on
little
thinking
what
good
cause
he
would
have
before
the
end
of
the
year
for
remembering
the
names
of
the
trio
and
altogether
unaware
of
the
prominent
part
which
the
triple
alliance
was
destined
to
play
in
his
own
private
affairs
as
well
as
in
the
fortunes
of
ronleigh
college
chapter
ix
a
holiday
adventure
the
weeks
slipped
away
and
the
triple
alliance
soon
got
over
their
trials
and
began
to
enjoy
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
ronleigh
college
boys
they
wrote
letters
to
miss
eleanor
and
to
their
former
schoolfellows
and
received
in
reply
the
latest
news
from
the
birches
the
philistines
are
quite
friendly
now
wrote
acton
we
had
a
match
against
them
last
week
on
their
ground
and
they
gave
us
tea
after
it
awfully
slow
i
almost
wish
that
chap
noaks
was
back
so
do
i
added
diggory
as
he
finished
the
sentence
we
could
very
well
spare
him
oh
he
all
right
answered
jack
vance
that
row
blown
over
now
as
long
as
we
leave
him
alone
he
wo
interfere
with
us
wo
he
returned
the
other
you
take
my
word
for
it
he
forgotten
what
you
said
about
his
father
and
he
only
waiting
for
a
chance
to
pay
us
out
whenever
i
go
near
him
he
looks
as
black
as
ink
it
was
customary
at
ronleigh
to
have
what
was
called
a
holiday
this
was
usually
given
on
a
monday
to
enable
those
boys
who
lived
within
a
short
distance
of
the
school
to
spend
the
week
end
at
home
while
in
the
winter
or
spring
terms
the
boarders
who
remained
at
the
school
usually
devoted
the
greater
portion
of
the
day
to
a
i
shall
go
home
said
jack
vance
to
his
two
chums
todderton
only
about
half
an
hour
ride
from
here
on
the
railway
and
i
say
got
a
grand
idea
i
going
to
write
and
get
my
mater
to
invite
you
fellows
to
come
too
it
would
be
jolly
to
have
a
meeting
there
of
the
triple
alliance
and
i
sure
old
denson
would
let
you
go
if
we
came
back
on
monday
night
both
mugford
and
diggory
were
charmed
with
the
idea
but
really
think
your
mater
would
have
us
they
asked
of
course
she
will
if
i
ask
her
answered
jack
and
straightway
sat
down
to
write
the
letter
by
wednesday
evening
everything
including
the
formal
invitation
and
the
doctors
permission
to
accept
the
same
had
been
obtained
and
for
the
two
following
days
the
triple
alliance
could
talk
or
think
of
little
else
besides
their
projected
excursion
at
length
saturday
came
and
as
soon
as
morning
school
was
over
they
rushed
upstairs
to
change
into
their
best
clothes
and
having
crammed
their
brushes
and
combs
into
a
hurried
off
to
the
railway
station
in
order
that
they
might
as
jack
put
it
be
home
in
time
for
dinner
just
as
they
were
getting
into
the
train
who
should
come
out
of
the
but
young
noaks
hullo
said
jack
he
must
be
going
home
too
i
hope
he
wo
come
in
here
the
however
had
no
intention
of
making
another
attempt
to
force
his
society
on
the
triple
alliance
he
passed
them
with
a
surly
nod
and
entered
a
compartment
at
the
other
end
of
the
train
jack
vance
lived
in
the
suburbs
of
todderton
about
twenty
minutes
walk
from
the
railway
but
for
all
that
he
managed
to
carry
out
his
intention
of
being
home
in
time
for
dinner
and
the
three
boys
after
receiving
a
hearty
welcome
were
soon
seated
down
to
a
repast
which
came
very
acceptable
after
seven
weeks
of
school
fare
jack
said
vance
you
know
that
house
that
was
to
let
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
hermitage
who
think
taken
it
i
do
know
father
why
that
man
simpson
the
uncle
of
your
friend
he
is
my
friend
answered
jack
you
mean
noaks
fancy
his
coming
to
live
so
near
to
us
as
that
we
saw
him
in
the
train
just
now
he
here
for
the
holiday
i
ought
to
tell
you
continued
vance
turning
to
diggory
that
our
neighbour
is
called
hermit
he
a
queer
old
fellow
who
lives
by
himself
and
never
makes
friends
or
speaks
to
any
one
he
supposed
to
be
very
clever
and
i
heard
it
said
that
got
a
very
valuable
collection
of
coins
and
is
quite
an
authority
on
the
subject
it
one
of
his
hobbies
i
suppose
said
mugford
thoughtfully
that
as
he
a
hermit
why
his
place
is
called
the
hermitage
well
done
mug
said
jack
speaking
with
his
mouth
pretty
full
you
getting
quite
sharp
yes
that
it
continued
vance
laughing
the
old
man
away
from
home
just
now
he
was
suffering
from
rheumatism
very
badly
and
the
doctor
ordered
him
to
a
course
of
treatment
at
some
baths
the
conversation
turned
on
other
topics
and
when
at
length
they
rose
from
the
table
jack
proposed
a
stroll
round
the
garden
there
were
many
things
to
see
some
pet
rabbits
a
swing
and
an
old
which
jack
being
we
should
say
of
a
decidedly
nautical
turn
of
mind
had
turned
into
a
sort
of
miniature
shipbuilding
yard
for
the
construction
of
model
vessels
though
at
present
the
chief
use
to
which
the
place
seemed
to
have
been
put
was
the
production
of
a
great
amount
of
chips
and
shavings
i
say
exclaimed
the
owner
after
he
and
his
friends
had
amused
themselves
for
some
time
boring
holes
in
the
door
with
a
brace
i
know
what
we
do
let
go
over
and
explore
the
hermitage
anything
with
a
spice
of
excitement
in
it
was
meat
and
drink
to
diggory
he
immediately
seconded
the
proposition
and
mugford
after
a
hesitation
agreed
to
join
his
companions
in
the
enterprise
they
strolled
off
down
the
path
and
soon
reached
a
long
stretch
of
brick
wall
the
top
of
which
was
thickly
covered
with
fragments
of
broken
bottles
there
a
place
down
at
the
other
end
where
we
can
get
over
said
jack
i
smashed
the
glass
with
a
hammer
because
i
lost
a
ball
and
had
to
climb
over
and
get
it
one
day
last
holidays
the
hermitage
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
a
thick
mass
of
shrubs
and
trees
through
which
a
moment
later
the
triple
alliance
were
cautiously
threading
their
way
emerging
from
the
bushes
they
found
themselves
standing
on
a
gravel
path
green
with
moss
and
weeds
which
ran
round
the
house
a
queer
building
which
seemed
sadly
in
want
of
repair
the
plaster
was
cracked
and
discoloured
while
the
doors
and
windows
had
long
stood
in
need
of
a
fresh
coating
of
paint
i
say
whispered
mugford
had
we
better
go
back
what
if
the
old
chap
at
home
oh
it
all
right
there
nobody
about
answered
jack
let
go
on
and
see
what
the
place
is
really
like
they
round
the
building
it
was
evidently
unoccupied
though
the
delightful
sense
of
uncertainty
that
at
any
moment
some
one
might
pounce
out
upon
them
or
walk
down
the
drive
made
the
questionable
adventure
very
charming
have
you
ever
been
inside
asked
diggory
no
rather
not
i
do
think
any
one
has
except
the
doctor
and
an
old
woman
who
comes
in
to
do
the
well
then
i
going
in
answered
diggory
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
go
on
why
you
might
be
had
up
for
rubbish
i
not
going
to
steal
here
mug
lend
me
your
knife
a
minute
i
do
believe
this
one
fastened
he
continued
walking
up
to
one
of
the
windows
no
it
is
bother
i
awfully
sorry
mugford
using
the
big
blade
of
the
as
a
lever
diggory
had
just
succeeded
in
raising
the
sash
the
fraction
of
an
inch
when
the
steel
suddenly
snapped
off
short
at
the
handle
oh
never
mind
said
the
owner
let
go
back
now
what
if
seen
oh
there
no
fear
of
that
answered
jack
who
was
always
infected
with
the
adventurous
spirit
of
his
go
on
diggy
i
come
too
by
inserting
their
fingers
in
the
aperture
the
boys
soon
raised
the
sash
and
a
few
seconds
later
diggory
mounted
the
ledge
and
scrambled
through
the
window
come
on
he
said
the
coast
all
clear
jack
vance
joined
him
immediately
and
mugford
not
wishing
to
be
left
alone
outside
was
not
long
in
making
up
his
mind
to
follow
his
companions
the
room
in
which
the
three
boys
found
themselves
was
evidently
a
library
or
study
and
cupboards
with
glass
doors
containing
geological
and
other
specimens
occupied
much
of
the
wall
space
while
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
stood
a
large
covered
with
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
pens
bundles
of
papers
and
a
polished
mahogany
box
which
could
easily
be
recognized
as
a
the
intruders
stood
for
a
few
moments
gazing
round
in
silence
the
place
did
not
look
very
interesting
and
smelt
rather
damp
and
mouldy
i
say
exclaimed
jack
vance
look
there
he
do
seem
very
careful
how
he
leaves
his
things
when
he
goes
away
as
he
spoke
he
pointed
across
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
where
between
two
bookcases
an
iron
safe
had
been
let
into
the
wall
the
heavy
door
was
standing
half
open
while
the
floor
beneath
was
strewn
with
a
quantity
of
shallow
wooden
trays
lined
with
green
baize
old
bachelors
are
always
untidy
remarked
diggory
let
see
where
this
door
leads
to
he
turned
the
handle
as
he
spoke
and
walked
out
into
a
gloomy
little
hall
paved
with
cold
bare
flagstones
which
caused
their
footsteps
to
waken
mournful
echoes
in
the
empty
house
i
say
you
fellows
do
let
go
any
further
murmured
mugford
we
seen
enough
now
suppose
the
old
chap
came
back
and
he
never
reached
the
end
of
the
sentence
for
diggory
suddenly
raised
his
hand
exclaiming
in
a
whisper
hark
what
was
that
the
loud
ticking
of
mugford
old
turnip
of
a
watch
was
distinctly
audible
in
the
silence
which
followed
what
is
it
diggy
what
hark
there
it
is
again
listen
the
suspense
became
awful
at
length
diggory
dropped
his
hand
did
you
hear
footsteps
he
asked
i
certain
there
some
one
walking
about
on
the
gravel
path
we
shall
be
caught
whimpered
mugford
i
knew
we
should
what
can
we
do
bolt
answered
diggory
and
began
back
towards
the
library
door
stay
here
half
a
he
added
i
go
and
reconnoitre
ages
seemed
to
pass
while
jack
vance
and
mugford
stood
in
the
dark
passage
awaiting
their
companion
return
at
length
the
door
was
pushed
softly
open
it
all
right
there
no
one
there
i
must
have
been
mistaken
come
along
in
a
very
short
time
the
triple
alliance
were
once
more
outside
the
hermitage
diggory
lingered
for
a
moment
to
close
the
window
and
then
followed
his
companions
through
the
shrubs
and
over
the
wall
you
are
a
great
ass
diggy
to
go
giving
us
a
start
like
that
said
jack
as
they
paused
for
a
moment
to
take
breath
before
returning
to
the
house
well
i
could
have
sworn
i
heard
the
gravel
crunch
as
if
some
one
was
walking
on
it
returned
the
other
i
should
think
the
place
must
be
haunted
a
good
tea
with
all
kinds
of
nice
things
on
the
table
soon
revived
the
boys
from
the
trifling
shock
which
their
nerves
had
sustained
and
by
the
end
of
the
evening
their
adventure
was
wellnigh
forgotten
they
were
destined
however
to
remember
it
for
many
a
long
day
to
come
and
before
many
hours
had
passed
they
were
heartily
wishing
that
they
had
never
set
foot
inside
the
hermitage
but
kept
on
their
own
side
of
the
wall
the
party
were
seated
at
supper
on
sunday
evening
when
a
servant
entered
the
room
and
addressing
her
master
said
if
you
please
sir
there
a
policeman
called
to
see
you
jack
father
rose
from
his
chair
remarking
in
a
jocular
manner
i
expect
it
one
of
you
young
gentlemen
he
come
after
the
meal
was
nearly
over
when
vance
returned
and
reseated
himself
at
the
table
did
either
of
you
hear
the
dog
bark
last
night
he
asked
no
why
why
because
old
fossberry
house
has
been
broken
into
and
they
think
the
thieves
must
have
come
through
our
garden
there
were
some
footmarks
in
the
shrubbery
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
the
hearts
of
the
triple
alliance
seemed
to
jump
into
their
throats
and
their
mouths
grew
dry
and
parched
jack
stared
at
mugford
and
mugford
stared
at
diggory
but
none
of
them
spoke
it
seems
continued
vance
not
noticing
the
effect
which
his
first
announcement
had
produced
on
at
least
three
of
his
hearers
that
the
old
woman
who
looks
after
the
house
went
there
this
morning
and
found
that
the
iron
safe
in
which
the
old
chap
keeps
his
coins
had
been
opened
and
the
whole
collection
removed
the
only
trace
of
the
thieves
that
the
police
have
been
able
to
discover
is
the
broken
blade
of
a
which
was
on
a
near
the
window
what
will
they
get
if
they
are
caught
asked
jack
faintly
oh
penal
servitude
i
suppose
it
a
serious
business
housebreaking
how
quiet
you
boys
are
said
vance
a
short
time
later
i
think
you
must
be
tired
would
you
like
to
go
to
bed
the
three
friends
were
only
too
glad
to
avail
themselves
of
this
excuse
for
getting
away
into
some
place
where
they
could
indulge
in
a
little
private
conversation
diggory
and
mugford
slept
together
in
the
same
room
jack
followed
them
in
and
closed
the
door
well
he
exclaimed
we
in
a
nice
mess
but
we
did
steal
the
coins
said
mugford
of
course
we
did
the
safe
had
been
robbed
before
we
went
there
but
it
looks
as
if
we
done
it
and
if
they
find
out
we
got
into
the
house
i
do
see
how
we
going
to
prove
that
we
innocent
there
was
a
short
silence
then
diggory
spoke
look
here
jack
i
was
the
one
who
proposed
going
inside
the
place
shall
i
tell
your
well
i
was
thinking
of
doing
that
myself
only
i
do
see
what
good
it
can
do
if
we
tell
him
he
be
bound
to
tell
the
police
to
explain
about
those
footmarks
and
when
it
comes
out
that
we
got
into
the
house
i
should
think
we
are
pretty
certain
to
be
charged
with
having
stolen
the
coins
i
think
the
best
thing
will
be
to
keep
it
dark
we
did
crib
the
things
and
the
thieves
are
sure
to
be
caught
in
time
even
after
jack
had
retired
to
his
own
room
diggory
and
mugford
lay
awake
for
hours
discussing
the
situation
and
when
at
length
they
did
fall
asleep
it
was
only
to
dream
of
being
chased
by
the
hermit
and
a
swarm
of
policemen
who
forced
their
way
into
the
third
form
classroom
at
ronleigh
and
handcuffed
the
unfortunate
trio
in
the
very
bosom
of
the
happy
family
the
following
morning
was
spent
in
visiting
such
parts
of
the
town
of
todderton
as
were
worth
seeing
upon
my
word
said
jack
i
feel
funky
to
show
my
nose
outside
our
gate
just
as
if
i
really
had
prigged
those
wretched
coins
i
sha
be
at
all
sorry
this
evening
to
get
back
to
ronleigh
it
all
in
the
paper
this
morning
it
mentions
the
footmarks
and
the
and
says
that
as
yet
the
police
have
not
been
able
to
discover
any
further
traces
of
the
robbers
the
conditions
on
which
the
holiday
was
granted
required
every
boy
to
return
to
school
on
the
monday
evening
and
accordingly
about
seven
the
triple
alliance
found
themselves
once
more
on
their
way
to
the
railway
station
they
took
their
seats
and
had
hardly
done
so
when
young
noaks
entered
the
compartment
hullo
you
fellows
he
exclaimed
did
you
hear
me
whistle
i
was
standing
over
there
by
the
regarding
this
as
an
overture
of
friendship
after
their
recent
encounter
jack
vance
replied
in
an
equally
amicable
manner
and
after
a
few
remarks
the
party
relapsed
into
silence
at
chatton
the
station
before
ronleigh
a
man
who
had
so
far
travelled
with
them
got
out
and
the
four
boys
were
left
alone
hardly
had
the
train
started
again
when
noaks
put
down
his
paper
and
turning
to
his
companions
said
that
a
rum
business
about
that
old
chap
house
being
robbed
it
something
in
the
speaker
look
and
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
caused
the
three
listeners
to
experience
an
unpleasant
quickening
of
their
pulses
yes
answered
diggory
with
a
air
of
indifference
i
suppose
they
catch
the
thieves
in
time
i
suppose
so
returned
the
other
especially
if
they
find
the
chap
who
owns
that
knife
with
the
broken
blade
the
malignant
look
with
which
these
words
was
accompanied
showed
at
once
that
the
speaker
meant
mischief
the
three
friends
looked
at
one
another
in
horrified
amazement
could
it
be
possible
that
their
visit
to
the
hermitage
had
already
been
discovered
noaks
watched
their
faces
for
a
moment
evidently
well
pleased
with
the
effect
which
his
remark
had
produced
then
he
burst
out
laughing
look
here
he
continued
producing
from
his
pocket
a
i
wonder
if
that
anything
like
it
i
see
the
big
broken
the
triple
alliance
recognized
it
in
a
moment
as
one
of
the
articles
that
had
been
rescued
from
mugford
sale
at
the
birches
in
fact
the
owner
name
appeared
plainly
engraved
on
the
small
brass
plate
diggory
was
the
first
to
find
his
tongue
what
mean
we
did
steal
the
coins
my
dear
fellow
i
never
said
you
did
i
only
know
that
on
saturday
i
was
looking
over
our
wall
through
an
opening
there
happens
to
be
in
the
shrubs
and
saw
you
fellows
climbing
out
of
the
old
chap
window
and
after
you
gone
i
noticed
something
lying
in
the
path
and
i
hopped
over
and
picked
up
this
knife
give
it
here
it
mine
said
mugford
holding
out
his
hand
no
fear
answered
the
other
calmly
returning
the
piece
of
lost
property
to
his
own
pocket
in
this
case
finding
keeping
besides
i
not
sure
if
i
could
get
a
reward
for
this
if
i
sent
it
to
the
right
place
the
train
began
to
slacken
speed
as
it
approached
ronleigh
station
look
here
noaks
cried
jack
vance
in
a
fit
of
desperation
what
are
you
going
to
do
you
know
very
well
we
are
not
thieves
i
do
know
anything
of
the
sort
returned
the
tormentor
standing
up
to
take
his
bag
off
the
rack
all
i
know
is
just
what
i
told
you
see
here
vance
he
continued
rounding
on
jack
with
a
sudden
snarl
you
were
good
enough
some
little
time
ago
to
make
some
very
caddish
remarks
about
my
father
in
the
future
you
better
keep
your
mouth
shut
i
owe
all
three
of
you
a
dressing
down
for
things
that
happened
at
chatford
and
now
you
better
mind
your
p
and
q
if
you
do
want
to
be
hauled
up
for
housebreaking
with
this
parting
threat
the
left
the
carriage
mugford
jack
and
diggory
gazed
at
one
another
for
a
moment
with
anything
but
a
happy
look
on
their
faces
one
after
another
they
slowly
gathered
up
their
things
and
stepped
out
on
to
the
platform
hardly
had
they
done
so
when
they
heard
their
names
called
and
turning
round
beheld
the
small
figure
of
rats
rushing
forward
to
meet
them
hullo
he
exclaimed
old
ally
sent
me
down
to
get
a
paper
and
i
thought
you
come
by
this
train
i
say
there
a
fine
row
on
up
at
the
school
such
a
lark
i
tell
you
about
it
as
we
go
along
chapter
x
a
screw
loose
in
the
sixth
for
the
time
being
the
three
friends
forgot
their
own
troubles
in
their
eagerness
to
hear
rat
description
of
certain
events
which
had
happened
during
their
absence
from
ronleigh
look
sharp
out
with
it
they
exclaimed
what
happened
well
began
rathson
it
all
came
out
through
young
bayley
acting
the
fool
and
spraining
his
ankle
you
know
we
had
the
this
morning
and
the
hares
ran
out
to
arrow
hill
and
back
again
round
by
the
canal
and
birksam
church
just
after
we
rounded
the
hill
young
bayley
jumped
off
the
top
of
a
high
hedge
and
twisted
his
foot
so
badly
that
he
could
stand
up
as
it
happened
there
was
a
check
just
then
and
carton
ran
forward
and
told
allingford
what
had
happened
he
and
oaks
came
back
and
said
the
only
thing
would
be
to
get
him
to
chatton
station
and
so
home
by
train
it
was
awfully
decent
of
those
chaps
they
carried
bayley
all
the
way
and
then
oaks
went
home
with
him
and
allingford
walked
back
and
so
of
course
they
missed
half
the
run
awfully
brickish
of
them
i
call
it
considering
that
it
was
only
a
kid
like
bayley
the
triple
alliance
gave
a
murmur
of
assent
was
that
what
the
row
about
asked
diggory
oh
bless
you
no
i
have
come
to
that
yet
after
he
seen
oaks
and
bayley
into
the
train
old
ally
started
to
walk
home
there
a
little
about
half
a
mile
out
of
chatton
called
the
black
swan
and
he
thought
he
call
and
ask
if
they
seen
the
fellows
pass
you
know
thurston
the
prefect
that
chap
who
came
to
the
door
when
we
were
having
that
meeting
in
the
lab
well
now
if
he
and
mouler
and
two
or
three
more
of
that
sort
were
sitting
in
the
taproom
smoking
and
drinking
beer
and
having
a
regular
high
old
time
they
lagged
behind
on
purpose
of
course
allingford
kicked
them
all
out
and
he
and
had
a
frightful
row
they
say
the
big
chaps
want
to
hush
the
matter
up
as
far
as
they
can
and
not
report
it
to
old
denson
for
fear
he
make
it
an
excuse
to
put
a
stop
to
ally
slanged
thurston
right
and
left
and
told
him
that
if
he
chose
to
drink
beer
in
a
low
with
the
biggest
blackguards
in
the
school
he
expect
that
the
fellows
in
the
sixth
would
have
anything
to
do
with
him
and
that
he
ought
to
send
in
his
resignation
as
a
prefect
on
entering
the
school
buildings
our
three
friends
were
convinced
of
the
truth
of
their
comrade
story
and
on
their
way
to
the
schoolroom
the
question
was
repeated
at
least
half
a
dozen
times
have
you
heard
about
old
being
cobbed
in
the
black
swan
diggory
thought
of
the
conversation
he
had
overheard
in
acton
study
and
mentioned
it
to
carton
yes
answered
the
latter
big
fletcher
a
beast
i
know
very
chummy
with
him
but
i
do
see
that
got
much
to
do
with
it
my
brother
who
left
last
term
said
that
used
to
be
rather
a
jolly
chap
only
he
got
a
fearful
temper
when
he
crossed
most
of
the
chaps
like
him
as
a
prefect
because
as
long
as
you
do
interfere
with
him
he
does
seem
to
care
much
what
any
one
does
the
real
thing
is
he
going
to
the
dogs
and
as
allingford
says
he
ought
to
resign
away
in
one
of
the
sixth
form
studies
the
subject
of
their
conversation
was
sitting
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
frowning
at
the
fire
he
was
roused
from
his
reverie
by
some
one
putting
his
head
round
the
corner
of
the
door
and
exclaiming
hullo
hullo
fletcher
where
on
earth
have
you
been
all
the
evening
the
was
tall
and
lanky
he
had
a
sharp
face
with
thin
straight
lips
and
two
deep
lines
which
looked
almost
like
scars
between
the
eyebrows
he
shut
the
door
and
dragging
forward
a
chair
sat
down
with
his
feet
on
the
fender
and
commenced
warming
his
hands
at
the
fire
oh
i
been
nowhere
in
particular
he
answered
laughing
but
i
say
young
man
you
seem
to
have
raised
a
pretty
good
hornets
nest
about
your
ears
along
this
corridor
yes
i
know
they
had
the
cheek
to
send
me
that
he
leaned
back
as
he
spoke
and
taking
a
piece
of
paper
from
the
table
tossed
it
across
to
his
friend
it
was
a
letter
signed
by
most
of
the
prefects
suggesting
that
he
should
send
in
his
resignation
humph
said
fletcher
that
a
nice
sort
of
a
round
robin
do
you
call
it
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
oh
i
shall
resign
and
have
done
with
it
i
sick
of
having
to
masquerade
about
as
a
good
boy
i
mean
to
do
what
i
like
pooh
returned
the
other
now
that
you
are
a
prefect
i
give
up
all
the
privileges
and
the
right
to
go
out
and
come
in
when
you
like
just
because
a
chap
like
allingford
chooses
to
take
offence
at
something
you
do
they
ca
force
you
to
resign
unless
they
go
to
the
doctor
and
they
wo
do
that
i
know
what
i
do
i
tell
them
pretty
straight
to
go
and
be
hanged
and
keep
their
sermonizing
to
themselves
thurston
turned
on
the
speaker
with
a
sudden
burst
of
anger
oh
yes
he
exclaimed
you
always
saying
you
do
this
and
do
that
but
when
the
time
comes
you
turn
tail
and
sneak
away
look
here
you
were
the
one
who
proposed
going
into
the
black
swan
this
morning
and
when
young
mouler
said
allingford
was
coming
you
slipped
out
of
the
back
door
and
left
us
to
face
the
shindy
well
returned
the
other
laughing
i
thought
you
chaps
were
going
to
bolt
too
i
hopped
over
the
wall
at
the
back
into
the
field
and
waited
there
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
as
no
one
came
i
made
tracks
home
that
all
very
fine
you
took
precious
good
care
to
save
your
own
bacon
you
always
do
oh
go
on
answered
fletcher
rising
from
his
chair
you
in
a
wax
well
ta
ta
do
you
resign
this
little
passage
of
arms
was
not
the
first
of
the
kind
that
had
taken
place
between
fletcher
and
thurston
and
it
did
not
prevent
a
renewal
of
their
friendship
on
the
morrow
the
latter
following
either
his
own
inclination
or
the
advice
of
his
chum
decided
not
to
resign
his
position
as
a
prefect
and
in
a
few
days
time
the
majority
of
the
school
had
wellnigh
forgotten
the
fracas
at
the
black
swan
among
those
in
high
places
however
the
affair
was
not
so
easily
overlooked
the
big
fellows
kept
their
own
counsel
but
it
soon
became
evident
that
thurston
was
being
cut
and
by
the
other
members
of
the
sixth
while
he
for
his
part
as
though
by
way
of
retaliation
began
to
more
freely
than
ever
with
boys
lower
down
in
the
school
and
of
decidedly
questionable
character
it
awfully
bad
form
of
a
chap
who
a
prefect
chumming
up
with
a
fellow
like
mouler
in
the
upper
fourth
said
carton
one
afternoon
i
wonder
old
is
ashamed
to
do
it
and
now
he
hand
and
glove
with
those
chaps
hawley
and
gull
in
the
fifth
they
both
got
heaps
of
money
but
they
frightful
cads
from
the
morning
following
their
return
to
ronleigh
the
triple
alliance
had
been
kept
in
a
continual
state
of
uneasiness
and
suspense
wondering
what
action
noaks
would
take
regarding
his
discovery
of
their
visit
to
the
hermitage
the
days
passed
by
and
still
he
made
no
further
reference
to
the
matter
and
took
no
notice
of
any
of
the
three
friends
when
he
happened
to
pass
them
in
the
passages
the
fact
was
that
for
the
time
being
his
attention
was
turned
in
another
direction
like
most
fellows
of
his
kind
noaks
was
a
regular
toady
ready
to
do
anything
in
return
for
the
privilege
of
being
able
to
rub
shoulders
occasionally
with
some
one
in
a
higher
position
than
himself
and
he
eagerly
seized
the
opportunity
which
his
friendship
with
mouler
afforded
him
of
becoming
intimate
with
thurston
it
was
rather
a
fine
thing
for
a
boy
in
the
upper
fourth
to
be
accosted
in
a
familiar
manner
by
a
prefect
and
asked
sometimes
to
visit
the
latter
in
his
study
and
when
such
things
were
possible
it
was
hardly
worth
while
to
spend
time
and
attention
in
carrying
on
a
feud
with
youngsters
in
the
third
form
but
noaks
had
never
forgotten
the
double
humiliation
he
had
suffered
at
chatford
first
in
being
sent
off
the
football
field
and
again
in
the
disastrous
ending
to
the
attempted
raid
on
the
birchites
fireworks
nor
had
he
forgiven
the
triple
alliance
for
the
part
which
they
had
played
especially
on
the
latter
occasion
in
bringing
shame
and
confusion
on
the
heads
of
the
philistines
one
morning
nearly
a
month
after
the
holiday
the
three
friends
were
strolling
arm
in
arm
through
the
archway
leading
from
the
quadrangle
to
the
paved
playground
when
they
came
face
to
face
with
their
old
enemy
he
was
about
to
push
past
them
without
speaking
then
seeming
suddenly
to
change
his
mind
he
pulled
up
took
something
from
his
pocket
and
handing
it
to
jack
vance
said
shortly
there
i
thought
you
like
to
see
that
it
seems
a
good
chance
to
earn
some
the
packet
turned
out
to
be
a
copy
of
the
todderton
weekly
paper
i
marked
the
place
added
noaks
turning
on
his
heel
with
a
sneering
laugh
you
need
give
it
me
back
a
cross
of
blue
chalk
had
been
placed
against
a
short
paragraph
appearing
under
the
heading
local
notes
jack
read
it
out
loud
for
the
edification
of
his
two
companions
we
notice
that
fossberry
has
offered
a
reward
of
pounds
for
any
information
which
shall
lead
to
the
arrest
of
the
thieves
who
entered
his
house
some
few
weeks
ago
and
stole
a
valuable
collection
of
coins
as
yet
the
police
have
been
unable
to
discover
any
further
traces
of
the
missing
property
but
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
before
long
the
offenders
will
be
discovered
and
brought
to
justice
there
was
a
moment
silence
i
wish
i
told
my
muttered
jack
vance
well
tell
him
now
said
diggory
oh
no
i
ca
now
he
wonder
why
i
had
done
it
sooner
besides
i
believe
noaks
is
only
doing
this
to
frighten
us
he
ca
prove
that
we
stole
the
coins
because
we
did
all
the
same
it
would
be
very
awkward
if
he
sent
the
police
that
and
told
them
he
seen
us
climbing
out
of
the
old
chap
window
yes
answered
diggory
i
suppose
it
would
look
rather
fishy
bother
him
why
ca
he
leave
us
alone
chapter
xi
shadows
of
coming
events
the
easter
holidays
came
and
went
as
rapidly
as
easter
holidays
always
do
and
before
the
alliance
had
recovered
from
the
excitement
connected
with
their
first
experience
of
breaking
up
at
ronleigh
they
were
back
again
greeting
their
friends
asking
new
boys
their
names
and
in
short
commencing
their
second
term
as
regular
old
stagers
up
to
the
present
they
had
been
content
to
lie
low
and
had
remained
satisfied
with
making
the
acquaintance
of
their
in
the
happy
family
but
now
they
began
to
take
more
interest
in
school
matters
in
general
and
to
notice
what
was
going
on
in
other
circles
besides
their
own
in
answer
to
the
eager
inquiries
of
his
two
companions
jack
vance
said
that
he
had
seen
nothing
of
noaks
during
the
holidays
except
having
passed
him
on
one
or
two
occasions
in
the
street
the
notice
of
the
fifty
pounds
reward
still
appeared
in
the
windows
of
the
police
station
but
the
robbery
itself
was
beginning
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
thing
of
the
past
and
was
already
wellnigh
forgotten
i
wonder
if
noaks
has
still
got
my
knife
said
mugford
oh
i
do
know
answered
jack
he
too
much
taken
up
with
mouler
and
gull
and
all
that
lot
to
think
about
us
i
should
bother
my
head
about
it
any
further
he
only
showed
us
that
paper
out
of
spite
to
put
us
in
a
funk
it
was
pretty
evident
to
the
most
casual
observer
that
the
quarrel
which
the
black
swan
incident
had
occasioned
between
thurston
and
his
brother
prefects
had
not
yet
been
dismissed
from
the
minds
of
either
party
the
former
became
more
lax
than
ever
in
the
discharge
of
his
duties
and
avoiding
the
society
of
his
school
equals
sought
the
companionship
of
such
boys
as
hawley
gull
and
mouler
who
at
length
came
to
be
known
throughout
the
college
as
thirsty
lot
with
the
exception
of
fletcher
the
prefects
left
him
severely
alone
allingford
occasionally
came
down
on
him
for
allowing
all
kinds
of
misconduct
to
pass
unchecked
but
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
a
fellow
who
was
hand
and
glove
with
some
of
the
principal
offenders
should
have
much
influence
or
power
in
maintaining
law
and
order
and
these
interviews
with
the
captain
usually
ended
in
an
exchange
of
black
looks
and
angry
words
the
consequences
which
resulted
from
this
lack
of
harmony
among
those
in
authority
may
be
easily
imagined
old
thirsty
never
makes
a
row
when
he
sees
a
chap
doing
was
the
cry
why
should
oaks
and
rowlands
and
those
other
fellows
kick
up
bothers
and
give
lines
for
the
same
thing
to
all
these
murmurers
the
prefects
turned
a
deaf
ear
i
do
care
what
thurston
does
would
be
their
answer
you
know
the
rule
and
that
sufficient
any
further
remonstrance
on
the
part
of
the
offender
was
met
with
a
summary
shut
up
or
you
get
your
head
punched
and
so
for
a
time
the
matter
ended
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
the
juveniles
of
the
third
form
should
trouble
their
heads
to
take
much
notice
of
this
disagreement
among
the
seniors
for
one
thing
they
knew
nothing
of
what
was
said
and
done
in
the
sixth
form
studies
and
even
the
prefects
themselves
never
thought
for
a
moment
that
this
little
bit
of
friction
in
the
machinery
of
ronleigh
college
would
figuratively
speaking
lead
to
hot
bearings
and
a
narrow
shave
of
a
general
breakdown
so
the
members
of
the
happy
family
pursued
the
even
tenor
of
their
way
getting
into
scrapes
and
scrambling
out
of
them
feasting
on
pastry
and
turning
up
in
force
on
saturday
afternoon
to
witness
the
cricket
matches
and
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
though
oaks
and
rowlands
might
be
a
trifle
strict
and
rather
freehanded
with
lines
and
impots
yet
all
this
could
be
overlooked
and
forgiven
for
the
sake
of
the
punishment
which
they
inflicted
on
the
enemy
bowling
as
it
has
been
all
along
the
intention
of
this
story
to
follow
the
fortunes
of
the
triple
alliance
the
record
of
their
second
term
at
ronleigh
would
not
be
complete
without
some
mention
of
their
memorable
adventure
with
the
wednesday
the
fourteenth
of
june
was
jack
vance
birthday
and
just
before
morning
school
he
expressed
his
intention
of
keeping
it
up
in
a
novel
manner
look
here
he
remarked
to
his
two
companions
you
know
that
little
bootmaker
shop
just
down
the
road
before
you
come
to
the
church
there
a
notice
in
the
window
tricycle
on
hire
well
the
mater
sent
me
some
money
this
year
instead
of
a
hamper
so
i
thought
i
hire
the
machine
and
we
go
out
for
a
ride
and
take
it
in
turns
for
one
to
walk
or
trot
behind
oh
i
advise
you
not
to
cried
rats
who
was
standing
by
and
overheard
the
project
why
not
why
it
a
rotten
old
one
of
the
first
i
should
think
that
was
ever
made
it
like
working
a
and
it
rattles
and
bangs
about
until
you
think
every
minute
it
must
all
be
coming
to
pieces
it
got
a
sort
of
instead
of
a
saddle
maxton
hired
it
out
one
day
the
term
before
last
and
he
and
i
and
collis
rode
to
chatton
it
is
meant
to
carry
three
but
the
seat
very
wide
and
they
squeezed
me
in
between
them
there
something
wrong
with
the
and
it
makes
a
beastly
grinding
noise
as
it
goes
along
so
maxton
christened
it
the
fellows
are
always
chaffing
old
jobling
about
it
when
they
go
into
his
shop
to
buy
bits
of
leather
and
asking
him
how
much
he
take
for
his
and
the
old
chap
gets
into
an
awful
wax
oh
i
do
care
answered
jack
it
be
a
lark
and
we
need
go
what
say
diggy
diggory
and
mugford
both
expressed
their
willingness
to
join
in
the
expedition
and
arrangements
were
accordingly
made
for
it
to
take
place
that
afternoon
you
better
not
let
old
jobling
see
three
of
you
get
on
at
once
said
rats
i
should
send
mugford
on
in
front
and
pick
him
up
when
you
get
round
the
corner
rathson
description
of
the
was
certainly
not
exaggerated
it
was
a
rusty
concern
a
relic
of
the
dark
ages
of
cycling
and
as
if
it
had
not
been
used
for
a
twelvemonth
jobling
squirted
some
oil
into
the
bearings
knocked
the
dust
off
the
cushioned
seat
and
remarked
that
a
shilling
an
hour
was
the
proper
charge
but
that
as
he
always
favoured
the
ronleigh
gentlemen
he
would
say
two
shillings
and
they
might
keep
it
the
whole
afternoon
jack
as
we
have
said
before
was
of
rather
a
nautical
turn
of
mind
and
occasionally
when
the
fit
was
on
him
loved
to
interlard
his
conversation
with
seafaring
expressions
she
is
much
of
a
craft
to
look
at
he
remarked
as
they
drew
up
and
dismounted
at
the
spot
where
mugford
stood
waiting
for
them
but
imagine
this
is
my
and
that
we
going
for
a
cruise
now
then
diggy
you
the
mate
and
you
shall
sit
on
the
starboard
side
and
steer
mugford
the
passenger
so
he
go
in
the
middle
i
captain
and
i
work
the
port
treadles
now
then
all
aboard
the
boys
scrambled
on
to
the
seat
and
with
some
little
amount
of
crushing
and
squeezing
got
settled
in
their
places
and
at
the
word
ahead
the
voyage
commenced
they
went
lumbering
and
clattering
through
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
at
length
after
having
roused
the
dormant
wit
of
one
who
shouted
knives
to
grind
after
them
they
gained
the
highroad
for
half
a
mile
the
voyage
was
prosperous
enough
then
the
adventures
began
they
were
going
at
a
good
pace
down
a
gentle
slope
and
on
turning
a
corner
saw
immediately
in
front
of
them
a
narrow
piece
of
road
with
a
on
one
side
and
a
high
bank
on
the
other
some
one
had
carelessly
left
a
wheelbarrow
standing
very
nearly
in
the
centre
of
the
highway
and
there
was
only
just
room
to
pass
it
on
the
water
side
starboard
a
little
the
steering
gear
worked
rather
stiffly
diggory
gave
the
handle
a
hard
twist
and
it
went
round
further
than
he
intended
port
cried
the
captain
hard
but
it
was
too
late
and
the
next
moment
the
ran
down
the
sloping
bank
and
plunged
into
the
it
gave
a
violent
lurch
but
fortunately
its
breadth
of
beam
kept
it
from
overturning
and
the
water
being
not
more
than
a
few
inches
deep
only
wet
the
boots
of
the
mariners
you
great
ass
diggy
why
did
you
demanded
the
captain
the
mate
who
as
a
matter
of
fact
could
not
have
told
the
difference
between
the
nautical
port
and
answered
promptly
so
i
did
and
the
two
officers
commenced
to
punch
each
other
with
their
disengaged
hands
this
combat
which
was
conducted
with
the
utmost
good
feeling
on
both
sides
had
been
continued
for
nearly
a
minute
when
the
passenger
on
whose
unoffending
back
a
large
proportion
of
the
blows
were
falling
remarked
well
if
we
are
going
to
stop
here
all
day
when
you
quite
done
we
better
think
about
getting
out
they
were
at
least
four
yards
from
the
shore
and
it
was
impossible
to
reach
it
some
one
must
take
off
his
boots
and
socks
and
haul
her
out
said
diggory
well
i
ca
answered
jack
the
captain
never
ought
to
leave
the
ship
oh
i
go
answered
mugford
laughing
and
accordingly
after
performing
some
complicated
gymnastic
feats
in
getting
off
his
boots
he
slid
from
the
seat
into
the
water
and
so
hauled
the
back
to
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
in
detail
all
the
alarming
incidents
which
happened
during
the
outward
passage
they
had
not
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
further
when
something
went
wrong
with
the
brake
they
flew
down
a
long
hill
holding
on
for
dear
life
nothing
but
the
grand
way
in
which
the
mate
managed
this
time
to
steer
a
straight
course
down
the
middle
of
the
road
saving
them
from
destruction
nevertheless
mounting
the
last
slope
was
such
hard
labour
that
mugford
had
to
turn
to
and
work
his
passage
by
every
now
and
again
taking
a
spell
at
the
treadles
look
here
said
diggory
at
length
do
you
think
we
gone
far
enough
we
sha
be
back
in
time
for
tea
oh
i
forgot
answered
the
captain
we
see
stand
by
your
anchor
let
the
stopped
and
jack
vance
pulled
out
his
watch
by
me
it
twelve
and
i
four
hours
slow
twelve
to
one
one
to
two
two
to
three
three
to
four
four
yes
it
time
we
turned
round
now
then
ship
the
tricycle
clanked
and
rattled
away
merrily
enough
on
the
return
journey
until
it
came
to
the
long
hill
which
this
time
had
to
be
climbed
instead
of
descended
do
let
get
off
said
jack
we
ought
to
rush
her
up
this
if
we
set
our
minds
to
it
with
a
great
deal
of
panting
and
struggling
they
succeeded
in
getting
about
then
suddenly
there
was
a
crack
and
the
machine
instead
of
going
forward
began
to
run
back
faster
and
faster
it
went
the
pedals
remaining
motionless
under
their
feet
the
chain
gone
gasped
the
captain
there
a
cart
behind
quick
run
her
aground
of
course
the
mate
turned
the
handle
the
wrong
way
on
one
side
of
the
road
was
an
ordinary
hedge
while
on
the
other
lay
a
deep
ditch
and
into
this
a
moment
later
the
disappeared
with
every
soul
on
board
there
was
an
awful
moment
when
earth
sky
arms
legs
wheels
and
bushes
seemed
all
mixed
together
and
then
jack
vance
found
himself
resting
on
his
hands
and
knees
in
a
puddle
of
dirty
water
diggory
and
mugford
had
been
driven
with
considerable
violence
into
the
thickest
part
of
a
thorn
hedge
and
proceeded
to
extricate
themselves
therefrom
with
many
groans
and
lamentations
well
said
the
mate
as
they
proceeded
to
drag
the
machine
out
of
the
ditch
i
should
think
jack
you
celebrated
your
birthday
about
enough
now
you
better
give
over
or
we
shall
all
be
sent
home
in
a
sack
me
cried
the
captain
with
great
indignation
it
was
fault
you
dummy
you
put
the
helm
over
wrong
again
you
hullo
you
kids
interrupted
a
voice
behind
them
and
turning
round
the
three
friends
saw
the
burly
form
of
john
acton
pushing
a
bicycle
up
the
hill
hullo
he
continued
it
young
trevanock
what
up
have
you
had
a
spill
yes
the
chain
broke
and
we
ran
into
the
ditch
umph
bad
business
now
you
have
to
foot
it
i
suppose
yes
answered
jack
ruefully
and
we
bound
to
be
back
late
pushing
this
old
thing
all
the
way
i
wish
old
jobling
would
try
a
ride
on
it
himself
oh
is
that
the
exclaimed
the
prefect
laughing
well
look
here
if
you
late
i
see
whoever
on
duty
and
tell
him
about
the
breakdown
and
see
if
i
can
get
you
off
oh
thanks
awfully
chorused
the
small
boys
i
half
a
mind
to
say
i
would
continued
acton
looking
round
as
he
put
his
foot
on
the
step
of
his
machine
and
nodding
his
head
at
diggory
i
owe
you
a
grudge
for
not
telling
me
what
i
wanted
to
know
about
my
young
brother
the
football
captain
was
as
good
as
his
word
he
got
the
triple
alliance
excused
the
impot
which
would
otherwise
have
been
awarded
them
for
arriving
at
the
school
half
an
hour
late
and
the
only
misfortune
which
resulted
from
their
eventful
excursion
was
that
jack
vance
had
to
expend
a
further
portion
of
his
postal
order
in
paying
jobling
for
repairing
the
broken
chain
the
day
however
did
not
close
without
another
incident
happening
to
one
of
the
voyagers
which
though
trifling
in
itself
proved
as
it
were
the
shadow
of
coming
events
which
were
destined
to
seriously
affect
the
and
happiness
of
all
the
ronleigh
boys
crossing
the
quadrangle
soon
after
tea
diggory
saw
something
bright
lying
on
the
gravel
it
proved
to
be
a
silver
with
the
letters
engraved
on
the
front
he
took
it
with
him
into
the
and
holding
it
up
as
the
boys
were
assembling
at
their
desks
for
preparation
asked
if
any
one
knew
who
was
the
owner
yes
i
do
answered
young
fletcher
it
thirsty
i
seen
it
often
preparation
of
the
next
day
work
having
ended
diggory
attention
was
occupied
for
a
time
in
discussing
with
carton
the
merits
of
some
foreign
stamps
just
before
supper
however
he
remembered
the
and
hurried
away
to
restore
it
to
its
rightful
owner
thurston
was
evidently
at
home
for
a
prolonged
shout
of
laughter
and
the
clamour
of
several
voices
reached
diggory
ears
as
he
approached
the
study
as
he
knocked
at
the
door
the
noise
suddenly
ceased
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
then
a
murmur
in
a
low
tone
followed
by
a
scuffling
of
feet
and
the
overturning
of
a
chair
who
there
you
ca
come
in
shouted
the
owner
of
the
den
i
do
want
to
answered
diggory
through
the
keyhole
i
brought
your
that
i
picked
up
in
the
oh
it
only
a
kid
said
the
voice
of
fletcher
senior
and
the
next
instant
the
door
was
unlocked
by
thurston
who
opened
it
about
six
inches
and
immediately
thrust
his
body
into
the
aperture
as
though
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
the
visitor
getting
any
sight
of
the
interior
of
the
room
oh
thanks
you
a
brick
he
said
taking
the
box
and
immediately
closed
the
door
and
turned
the
key
diggory
was
retracing
his
steps
along
the
passage
wondering
what
could
be
the
object
of
all
this
secrecy
when
he
nearly
ran
into
the
school
captain
hullo
young
man
said
the
latter
where
have
you
been
to
thurston
study
what
have
you
been
there
for
demanded
allingford
sharply
with
a
sudden
change
in
his
tone
and
manner
only
to
give
him
his
that
i
picked
up
in
the
the
captain
eyed
the
speaker
narrowly
as
though
half
inclined
to
doubt
the
truth
of
this
explanation
then
apparently
satisfied
with
the
honest
expression
of
the
small
boy
face
told
him
to
get
down
to
supper
the
latter
wandered
off
wondering
more
than
ever
what
could
have
been
the
object
of
the
private
gathering
in
thurston
study
which
he
had
just
interrupted
it
what
i
told
you
before
remarked
carton
when
diggory
chanced
to
mention
what
had
happened
thirsty
going
to
the
dogs
and
i
believe
big
fletcher
got
a
lot
to
do
with
it
allingford
ca
interfere
with
them
as
long
as
they
keep
to
themselves
i
do
know
what
they
do
but
i
should
be
surprised
if
there
is
a
rare
old
one
of
these
fine
days
mischief
certainly
was
brewing
and
the
came
sooner
than
even
carton
himself
expected
chapter
xii
the
wraxby
match
wednesday
the
of
july
saw
the
whole
of
ronleigh
college
in
a
state
of
bustle
and
excitement
the
near
approach
of
the
holidays
was
sufficient
in
itself
to
put
every
one
in
high
spirits
while
in
addition
to
this
the
afternoon
was
to
witness
the
chief
cricket
contest
of
the
season
the
annual
match
against
wraxby
grammar
school
during
the
hour
before
dinner
the
ground
itself
was
a
scene
of
brisk
activity
the
school
colours
flew
at
the
summit
of
the
flagstaff
the
boundary
flags
fluttered
in
the
breeze
a
number
of
willing
hands
under
the
direction
of
allingford
put
a
finishing
touch
to
the
pitch
with
the
big
roller
while
others
assisted
in
rigging
up
the
two
screens
of
white
canvas
in
line
with
the
wickets
i
do
hope
we
lick
them
said
little
rats
to
jack
vance
as
they
stood
by
the
pavilion
watching
oaks
mixing
some
whiting
for
the
creases
we
somehow
or
other
why
why
because
they
beaten
us
now
three
times
running
and
the
last
time
when
our
chaps
went
over
to
wraxby
and
got
licked
at
footer
their
captain
asked
ally
if
in
future
we
should
like
to
play
a
master
such
rot
continued
the
youthful
rats
boiling
with
wrath
as
if
we
could
smash
them
without
look
here
i
give
i
give
sixpence
if
we
could
win
and
with
this
burst
of
patriotic
enthusiasm
the
speaker
hurried
away
to
join
maxton
who
with
an
old
sprung
racquet
in
one
hand
and
the
inside
of
an
exploded
in
the
other
was
calling
to
him
from
the
adjoining
playing
field
to
come
and
play
tip
and
run
and
bring
something
that
do
for
a
wicket
the
feelings
expressed
by
rats
as
regards
the
result
of
the
match
were
shared
by
the
whole
school
and
by
none
more
so
than
the
members
of
the
third
form
the
happy
family
turned
up
to
a
man
and
encamped
upon
the
turf
within
twenty
yards
of
the
pavilion
bibbs
was
the
last
to
arrive
on
the
scene
of
action
and
did
so
with
a
bag
of
sweets
in
one
hand
a
book
in
the
other
and
a
piece
of
paper
pinned
by
some
joker
to
the
tail
of
his
coat
bearing
the
legend
please
to
kick
me
a
request
which
was
immediately
responded
to
in
a
most
hearty
and
generous
fashion
by
all
present
kicking
the
unfortunate
bibbs
afforded
every
one
such
exquisite
enjoyment
that
an
effort
was
made
to
prolong
the
pastime
by
forcible
attempts
to
fasten
the
placard
on
to
other
members
of
the
company
and
a
general
would
have
followed
if
the
attention
of
the
combatants
had
not
been
attracted
in
another
direction
ronleigh
having
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
go
in
first
the
wraxby
men
strolled
out
of
the
pavilion
to
take
the
field
they
were
a
lot
of
fellows
the
faded
flannel
caps
and
careless
way
in
which
they
sauntered
towards
the
pitch
proclaiming
the
fact
that
each
one
was
a
veteran
player
that
chap
with
the
gloves
in
his
hand
is
partridge
their
captain
said
carton
and
that
fellow
who
putting
out
the
single
stump
to
bowl
at
is
austin
he
does
put
them
in
to
some
tune
you
can
hardly
see
the
ball
it
so
swift
there
was
a
faint
from
the
pitch
see
that
cried
fletcher
junior
that
chap
austin
knocked
that
single
stump
out
of
the
ground
first
ball
my
eye
he
make
our
fellows
sit
up
i
bet
no
he
wo
cried
rats
excitedly
old
ally
knock
him
into
a
cocked
hat
he
soon
break
his
back
added
the
speaker
complaisantly
hullo
men
in
parkes
and
rowland
there
is
something
in
the
short
space
of
time
preceding
the
first
of
the
bat
at
a
cricket
match
which
rivals
in
interest
even
that
exciting
moment
at
football
when
the
centre
forward
stands
hovering
over
the
ball
waiting
for
the
whistle
to
give
the
signal
for
the
contest
to
commence
the
noisy
clatter
of
the
happy
family
ceases
as
the
crowd
of
boys
ranged
all
down
the
sides
of
the
field
turn
to
watch
the
opening
of
the
game
it
is
an
ideal
day
for
cricket
with
a
fresh
breeze
blowing
just
sufficient
to
temper
the
hot
afternoon
sunshine
and
cause
a
flutter
of
and
boundary
flags
rowland
takes
centre
twists
the
handle
of
his
bat
round
and
round
in
his
hands
and
is
heard
amid
the
general
hush
to
say
no
no
trial
austin
glances
round
at
the
motionless
figures
of
his
comrades
signals
to
to
stand
a
little
deeper
and
then
delivers
the
ball
with
an
easy
and
graceful
forward
stroke
the
batsman
returns
it
sharply
in
the
direction
of
the
opposite
wicket
and
an
almost
imperceptible
movement
like
the
releasing
of
a
spring
takes
place
among
the
fielders
so
begins
the
battle
twenty
up
had
just
been
called
from
the
pavilion
when
a
sharp
catch
in
the
slips
disposed
of
parkes
never
mind
cried
rats
here
comes
old
ally
he
make
them
trot
round
a
bit
the
captain
commenced
his
innings
with
a
leg
hit
which
sent
the
ball
to
the
boundary
a
wave
of
legs
and
arms
marking
its
track
as
the
spectators
with
a
joyous
yell
rolled
over
one
another
to
escape
being
hit
for
some
time
cheer
followed
cheer
and
the
happy
family
clapped
until
their
hands
smarted
then
suddenly
there
arose
a
prolonged
oh
from
all
the
field
hullo
what
the
matter
asked
bibbs
looking
up
from
the
book
he
was
reading
what
the
matter
shouted
maxton
wrathfully
snatching
away
the
volume
and
banging
bibbs
on
the
head
with
it
why
do
you
watch
the
game
old
ally
bowled
off
his
pads
it
was
only
too
true
the
captain
wicket
was
down
and
the
happy
family
after
a
simultaneous
ejaculation
of
it
tore
up
stalks
of
grass
and
began
to
chew
them
with
a
stern
expression
on
their
faces
this
disaster
seemed
but
the
forerunner
of
others
redfern
the
next
man
had
hardly
taken
his
place
at
the
wicket
when
a
sharp
the
glitter
of
bails
twirling
in
the
air
and
a
wraxby
shout
of
well
bowled
announced
his
fate
while
ten
minutes
later
rowland
one
of
the
mainstays
of
the
home
team
was
caught
in
a
most
provoking
manner
at
oh
bother
it
all
sighed
rats
this
is
nothing
but
a
procession
now
oaks
old
chap
do
your
best
for
us
cried
allingford
all
right
returned
the
other
laughing
as
he
paused
for
a
moment
outside
the
pavilion
to
fasten
the
strap
of
his
going
to
make
runs
this
journey
or
die
in
the
attempt
oaks
was
undoubtedly
a
regular
briton
just
the
sort
of
fellow
to
turn
the
fortunes
of
a
losing
game
he
walked
up
to
the
wicket
as
coolly
as
though
it
were
enclosed
within
a
practice
net
patted
down
the
ground
with
the
flat
of
his
bat
in
a
manner
which
seemed
to
imply
that
he
had
come
to
stay
and
then
proceeded
to
hit
three
twos
in
his
first
over
this
dashing
commencement
was
but
the
prelude
to
a
brilliant
bit
of
rapid
scoring
twos
and
threes
followed
each
other
in
quick
succession
allingford
shouted
the
crowd
roared
while
the
happy
family
gambolled
about
on
one
another
chests
and
stomachs
and
squealed
with
delight
like
the
poet
brook
oaks
might
have
exclaimed
men
may
come
and
men
may
go
but
i
go
on
for
ever
when
wraxby
changed
the
bowling
he
welcomed
the
by
sending
the
first
ball
into
the
next
field
and
continued
to
cut
and
drive
in
such
a
gallant
manner
that
even
bibbs
standing
up
to
get
the
full
use
of
his
lungs
shouted
go
and
well
hit
until
his
face
was
the
colour
of
a
poppy
i
say
exclaimed
carton
as
the
eighth
wicket
fell
i
wish
one
of
these
next
two
chaps
would
hang
on
a
bit
and
give
oaks
a
chance
of
getting
a
few
more
it
must
be
nearly
eighty
up
thurston
you
in
came
from
the
scorer
the
boy
named
was
sitting
by
himself
on
the
end
of
a
form
close
to
the
telegraph
moodily
scraping
up
the
ground
with
the
spikes
of
his
he
knew
that
most
of
his
comrades
in
the
eleven
would
give
him
the
cold
shoulder
and
so
did
not
mingle
with
them
inside
the
pavilion
he
rose
and
prepared
to
obey
the
summons
let
give
him
a
cheer
said
rats
he
may
do
go
it
thurston
sit
tight
and
keep
the
pot
boiling
the
big
fellow
turned
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
happy
family
and
with
something
of
the
old
smile
which
had
seldom
of
late
been
seen
upon
his
face
answered
all
right
my
boy
you
see
if
i
do
jolly
fellow
old
thirsty
remarked
rats
swelling
with
pride
at
this
friendly
recognition
he
can
play
when
he
likes
but
he
troubled
to
practise
much
of
late
he
used
always
phew
my
eye
what
an
awful
crack
a
terrifically
swift
ball
from
austin
had
risen
suddenly
from
the
hard
ground
thurston
had
no
time
to
avoid
it
but
turning
away
his
face
received
the
blow
on
the
back
of
his
head
he
dropped
his
bat
staggered
away
from
the
wicket
and
fell
forward
on
his
knees
to
suffer
for
the
cause
of
the
school
in
a
cricket
or
football
match
was
a
thing
which
like
charity
covered
a
multitude
of
sins
allingford
hurried
out
of
the
pavilion
and
ran
towards
the
pitch
while
partridge
and
a
few
more
of
the
wraxby
men
gathered
round
their
wounded
opponent
and
helped
him
to
his
feet
you
better
come
out
thurston
said
the
ronleigh
captain
i
send
the
next
man
in
no
i
go
on
replied
the
other
in
rather
a
shaky
voice
i
shall
be
all
right
in
a
minute
it
requires
something
more
than
ordinary
pluck
for
a
batsman
to
stand
up
to
fast
bowling
and
show
good
form
after
having
been
badly
hit
for
a
time
a
great
deal
of
determination
and
the
exercise
of
a
considerable
amount
of
will
power
are
necessary
to
conquer
the
natural
inclination
to
shrink
from
a
possible
repetition
of
the
injury
and
those
who
watched
the
dogged
manner
in
which
thurston
continued
to
defend
his
wicket
being
themselves
practical
cricketers
rewarded
him
with
loud
shouts
of
encouragement
and
praise
oaks
piled
on
the
score
with
unflagging
energy
while
the
careful
play
of
his
companion
defied
all
attempts
of
the
wraxby
bowlers
to
dissolve
the
partnership
bravo
shouted
the
spectators
go
and
another
at
length
just
as
the
telegraph
operator
had
received
the
welcome
order
a
hundred
up
the
ball
shot
and
crashed
into
wicket
he
came
slowly
back
from
the
pitch
still
holding
his
hand
to
the
back
of
his
head
and
though
his
individual
score
had
barely
run
into
double
figures
he
was
greeted
on
all
sides
with
hearty
cheers
payne
the
last
man
just
succeeded
in
cracking
his
and
the
innings
closed
for
as
the
fielders
came
trooping
in
a
small
boy
ran
past
the
third
form
encampment
exclaiming
i
say
you
chaps
old
punch
is
in
the
lower
road
over
by
that
tree
which
announcement
had
no
sooner
been
made
than
the
greater
part
of
the
happy
family
sprang
to
their
feet
and
went
scampering
across
the
field
in
the
direction
of
the
opposite
hedge
the
cause
of
this
stampede
it
must
be
explained
was
the
arrival
of
an
itinerant
vendor
of
whose
real
name
samuel
jones
had
been
changed
to
punch
on
account
of
the
prominence
of
his
nasal
organ
his
presence
within
the
grounds
of
ronleigh
college
was
not
approved
of
by
the
authorities
and
his
trade
with
the
small
boys
who
were
his
particular
patrons
was
carried
on
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
punch
establishment
ran
on
four
wheels
and
was
ornamented
with
a
number
of
daubs
representing
union
jacks
and
royal
standards
which
formed
the
framework
of
an
alarming
portrait
of
the
prince
of
wales
from
which
adornment
one
might
be
led
to
suppose
that
on
some
previous
occasion
his
royal
highness
had
patronized
the
stall
the
was
shovelled
out
of
a
tin
receptacle
and
pasted
in
lumps
on
to
the
top
of
very
shallow
glasses
the
standard
price
for
which
was
one
penny
and
there
being
a
scarcity
of
spoons
the
customers
usually
devoured
the
delicacy
in
the
same
manner
as
a
dog
does
a
saucer
of
milk
cynical
members
of
the
upper
classes
at
ronleigh
who
had
ceased
to
patronize
the
stall
charged
punch
with
not
being
in
washing
the
glasses
and
of
making
the
stuff
as
they
called
it
with
cornflour
instead
of
cream
but
the
small
boys
were
not
fastidious
and
as
each
one
had
two
helpings
which
they
ate
as
slowly
as
possible
to
prolong
the
enjoyment
they
were
still
refreshing
themselves
when
the
home
team
moved
out
to
field
look
sharp
cried
rats
giving
bibbs
elbow
a
sudden
jerk
which
caused
that
worthy
to
plaster
the
end
of
his
nose
with
the
remains
of
his
third
ice
come
on
let
see
the
beginning
the
second
half
of
the
game
proved
if
anything
more
exciting
than
the
first
two
wickets
fell
before
appeared
on
the
telegraph
oh
we
shall
lick
them
easily
cried
rats
jubilantly
while
fletcher
junior
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
by
handing
bibbs
bag
of
sweets
round
to
the
company
but
there
were
still
some
hard
nuts
to
be
cracked
in
the
wraxby
team
and
one
soon
appeared
in
partridge
the
captain
over
after
over
went
by
and
the
score
rapidly
increased
thirty
up
forty
up
fifty
up
two
more
wickets
were
taken
but
partridge
seemed
to
have
fairly
got
his
eye
in
and
gave
the
home
team
as
much
as
oaks
had
provided
for
the
visitors
to
make
matters
worse
austin
arriving
on
the
scene
sixth
man
in
appeared
to
be
also
possessed
with
a
determination
to
carry
his
bat
and
though
he
was
eventually
run
out
by
a
sharp
from
it
was
not
until
eighty
runs
had
been
registered
for
the
grammar
school
the
closing
scene
of
the
game
caused
an
amount
of
excitement
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
ronleigh
cricket
as
the
last
man
of
the
wraxby
team
went
in
to
bat
the
telegraph
was
changed
from
to
over
had
just
been
called
and
the
invincible
partridge
stepped
forward
to
play
evidently
making
up
his
mind
for
another
boundary
hit
thurston
had
been
put
on
to
bowl
at
the
top
end
and
stood
ready
to
recommence
the
attack
four
to
equal
five
to
beat
sighed
rats
bother
it
all
sure
to
win
a
cricket
match
needs
to
be
very
narrowly
watched
or
the
spectator
whose
eye
has
strayed
for
a
moment
from
the
game
misses
some
fine
piece
of
play
the
incident
which
finished
the
contest
between
ronleigh
college
and
wraxby
grammar
school
occupied
barely
three
seconds
of
time
yet
it
was
remembered
and
spoken
about
many
years
after
those
concerned
in
it
had
passed
on
to
swell
the
ranks
of
the
old
boys
partridge
commenced
the
over
with
a
hard
straight
drive
and
at
the
same
instant
thurston
gave
a
little
jump
into
the
air
with
his
right
arm
stretched
above
his
head
the
ball
had
passed
like
lightning
between
the
wickets
and
the
spectators
looked
for
a
moment
to
see
where
it
had
gone
then
a
wild
shriek
of
joy
from
the
happy
family
rent
the
air
it
was
true
enough
with
a
splendid
catch
thurston
had
brought
the
contest
to
a
close
and
secured
a
victory
for
ronleigh
college
this
brilliant
feat
coupled
with
the
gallant
manner
in
which
he
had
continued
his
innings
when
hurt
and
so
enabled
oaks
to
run
up
the
score
caused
the
black
sheep
of
the
sixth
form
to
be
regarded
as
the
hero
of
the
day
allingford
shook
him
by
the
hand
and
a
noisy
crowd
hoisted
him
shoulder
high
and
carried
him
three
times
round
the
quadrangle
thurston
certainly
had
good
reason
to
feel
proud
of
the
part
he
had
played
in
the
chief
match
of
the
season
and
might
in
years
to
come
have
always
looked
back
with
pleasure
on
this
of
july
unfortunately
another
event
of
a
sadly
different
character
was
destined
to
make
it
a
day
in
his
career
at
ronleigh
the
feeling
of
respect
and
which
his
prowess
in
the
field
had
awakened
in
the
minds
of
his
former
friends
afforded
him
a
splendid
opportunity
for
reassociating
himself
with
all
that
was
worthy
and
honourable
in
school
life
the
chance
no
sooner
presented
itself
however
than
it
was
flung
away
and
was
lost
for
ever
evening
preparation
was
over
and
supper
an
informal
meal
attendance
at
which
was
not
compulsory
was
in
progress
the
door
of
study
was
once
more
locked
on
the
inside
as
it
had
been
when
diggory
went
to
return
the
to
its
rightful
owner
fletcher
senior
hawley
and
gull
sat
on
three
sides
of
the
small
table
while
thurston
himself
occupied
the
fourth
hang
it
all
exclaimed
the
latter
throwing
down
a
handful
of
playing
cards
upon
the
table
and
pushing
back
his
chair
i
sha
play
any
more
i
got
no
more
tin
oh
go
on
i
lend
you
some
answered
fletcher

a
matter
of
fact

was
mightily
displeased
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
lost

square
up
as
it
is
till
next
term
it
all
very
well
for
fellows
like
you
three
who
have
rich
people
and
can
write
home
any
time
for
a
fiver
but
i
not
so
flush
of
look
here
gull
have
you
got
that
banjo
sing
us
a
song
all
right
answered
gull
reaching
down
and
picking
a
small
instrument
off
the
floor
what
you
have
oh
something
with
a
good
swing
to
it
i
feel
like
kicking
up
a
row
gull
tuned
up
struck
a
few
chords
and
then
launched
out
into
a
rattling
nigger
song
with
an
amount
of
go
and
clatter
sufficient
to
inspire
the
hearer
with
an
almost
irresistible
desire
to
get
up
and
dance
the
three
listeners
shouted
the
chorus
at
the
top
of
their
voices
pounding
the
table
with
their
fists
by
way
of
a
sort
of
drum
accompaniment
gull
was
just
preparing
to
commence
the
fourth
verse
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
study
door
wait
a
jiff
said
who
there
what
want
why
came
the
answer
uttered
in
rather
a
drawling
tone
i
wish
you
fellows
would
make
so
much
row
i
ca
possibly
work
do
be
quiet
oh
go
to
bath
shouted
it
only
that
old
browse
he
added
the
beggar
got
the
next
study
and
he
cramming
up
for
some
go
on
gull
the
entertainment
continued
and
waxed
more
noisy
than
ever
the
performers
hammering
the
table
with
a
ruler
and
two
to
add
zest
to
the
choruses
soon
there
came
another
interruption
very
different
in
tone
from
the
mild
expostulation
of
the
studious
browse
the
door
was
violently
shaken
and
from
without
came
the
sharp
peremptory
order
of
the
school
captain
look
here
thurston
just
shut
up
we
had
enough
of
this
horrible
row
for
one
night
stop
it
hear
all
right
growled
the
owner
of
the
study
keep
your
hair
on
old
fellow
sh
steady
on
thirsty
said
fletcher
in
a
low
tone
do
go
too
far
or
he
put
a
stop
to
our
next
merry
meeting
i
know
allingford
and
he
rather
a
hard
wall
to
run
your
head
against
that
confounded
old
browse
has
gone
and
sneaked
cried
the
other
with
a
flush
of
passion
on
his
face
let
wait
till
ally
gone
and
then
make
a
raid
on
the
old
hawley
and
gull
sprang
to
their
feet
with
a
murmur
of
assent
fletcher
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
remained
silent
what
we
do
is
this
continued
thurston
he
sits
with
his
back
to
the
door
i
pop
in
first
and
throw
this
tablecloth
over
his
head
then
while
i
hold
him
down
you
chaps
upset
the
things
and
put
out
the
light
then
we
rush
out
all
together
and
he
wo
know
for
certain
who
did
it
five
minutes
later
the
conspirators
crept
out
into
the
passage
and
towards
the
door
of
the
adjoining
study
fletcher
lingered
behind
and
instead
of
following
the
expedition
stole
softly
away
in
the
opposite
direction
another
moment
and
the
unfortunate
browse
was
struggling
to
rise
from
his
chair
with
his
head
enveloped
in
the
tablecloth
hawley
and
gull
following
immediately
in
rear
of
their
leader
sent
the
table
with
its
load
of
books
and
writing
materials
over
with
a
crash
threw
the
chairs
into
different
corners
of
the
room
and
were
about
to
scatter
the
contents
of
the
bookcase
over
the
floor
when
allingford
suddenly
burst
into
the
room
and
stood
glaring
round
like
an
angry
lion
with
one
swing
of
his
right
arm
he
sent
thurston
staggering
against
the
wall
and
then
stepping
forward
without
an
instant
hesitation
he
dealt
each
of
the
other
marauders
a
swinging
box
on
the
ear
the
two
fifth
form
boys
were
big
strong
fellows
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
though
a
fight
would
ensue
the
captain
however
followed
up
his
attack
with
amazing
promptness
and
before
his
antagonists
had
time
to
think
of
resistance
he
had
taken
them
both
by
the
shoulders
and
sent
them
flying
into
the
passage
there
he
exclaimed
i
teach
you
gentlemen
to
come
playing
pranks
on
sixth
form
studies
what
business
have
you
got
here
i
should
like
to
know
as
for
you
continued
the
speaker
casting
a
scornful
glance
at
the
originator
of
the
outrage
i
should
have
thought
a
fellow
a
prefect
ought
to
know
better
than
to
go
rioting
with
every
scamp
in
the
school
thurston
conduct
on
the
cricket
field
had
clearly
proved
him
to
be
no
coward
he
stood
his
ground
and
returned
allingford
angry
glances
with
a
look
of
fierce
defiance
he
attempted
to
make
some
reply
but
somehow
the
words
failed
him
and
turning
on
his
heel
he
walked
away
to
his
own
study
confound
that
fellow
fletcher
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
he
always
takes
precious
good
care
to
sneak
away
when
there
any
row
on
if
it
was
for
that
money
i
owe
him
i
punch
his
head
half
an
hour
later
there
was
a
sharp
rap
at
the
door
and
allingford
oaks
and
acton
entered
the
room
well
said
thurston
looking
up
with
a
frown
from
the
book
he
was
reading
what
want
now
i
do
remember
asking
you
fellows
to
come
and
see
me
a
chap
ca
call
his
study
his
own
nowadays
no
answered
acton
grimly
if
a
chap
wants
to
work
a
lot
of
blackguards
come
and
wreck
his
furniture
look
here
thurston
said
the
captain
coldly
we
no
wish
to
stay
here
longer
than
we
can
help
we
come
simply
to
tell
you
this
that
after
what
happened
the
prefects
are
determined
that
morning
you
send
in
your
resignation
to
the
doctor
and
supposing
i
do
choose
to
send
in
my
resignation
returned
the
other
then
answered
the
captain
calmly
we
shall
send
it
in
for
you
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
thurston
rose
from
his
chair
and
closing
his
book
flung
it
down
with
a
bang
upon
the
table
all
right
he
said
i
do
it
you
fellows
have
been
set
against
me
from
the
first
i
know
all
about
it
and
before
i
leave
this
place
pay
you
out
i
almost
wish
we
left
it
till
after
the
holidays
said
oaks
as
the
three
prefects
walked
down
the
passage
no
said
allingford
firmly
if
we
hesitate
and
the
fellows
see
it
we
lost
it
must
be
done
at
once
well
perhaps
so
answered
oaks
but
i
tell
you
this
thurston
means
mischief
i
wish
he
was
going
to
leave
he
wo
forget
this
in
a
hurry
and
my
belief
is
we
shall
hear
more
about
it
next
term
chapter
xiii
the
elections
thurston
resignation
as
might
have
been
expected
gave
rise
to
a
considerable
amount
of
excitement
and
conflicting
opinion
nearly
every
boy
in
the
school
saw
clearly
that
he
was
both
unworthy
and
unfitted
to
fulfil
the
duties
of
a
prefect
but
the
peculiar
circumstances
under
which
he
had
as
rats
put
it
been
given
notice
to
quit
caused
a
large
number
of
his
schoolfellows
to
side
with
him
and
condemn
the
action
of
the
captain
only
a
few
of
the
general
public
knew
exactly
what
the
row
had
been
the
sixth
form
authorities
refusing
to
be
catechized
would
answer
no
questions
while
the
other
side
took
good
care
to
spread
abroad
a
very
account
of
the
affair
the
wraxby
match
was
fresh
in
everybody
mind
awfully
hard
lines
i
call
it
said
the
cricketers
he
won
that
game
for
us
why
they
let
him
go
on
a
few
days
more
till
the
end
of
the
term
while
those
young
gentlemen
of
whom
a
few
are
to
be
found
in
every
school
who
cherish
a
strong
dislike
to
anything
in
the
shape
of
law
and
order
were
of
course
loud
in
their
expressions
of
dissatisfaction
at
the
removal
of
one
who
always
winked
at
their
transgressions
at
the
commencement
of
the
winter
session
it
soon
became
evident
that
seven
weeks
of
summer
holiday
had
not
dispelled
the
cloud
which
had
overshadowed
the
close
of
the
previous
term
no
sooner
had
the
first
excitement
of
meeting
and
settling
down
subsided
a
little
than
the
question
of
thurston
deposal
cropped
up
again
and
caused
an
unusual
amount
of
interest
to
be
felt
by
all
ronleigh
in
the
forthcoming
elections
every
school
has
its
own
methods
of
choosing
those
who
are
to
fill
the
posts
and
offices
in
connection
with
its
various
institutions
and
it
will
be
well
to
describe
in
a
few
words
how
this
was
done
at
ronleigh
in
order
that
the
reader
may
follow
with
greater
interest
the
working
out
of
an
important
event
in
the
history
of
the
college
the
elections
took
place
twice
a
year
at
the
commencement
of
the
summer
and
winter
terms
their
chief
object
being
to
appoint
what
was
known
as
the
sports
committee
who
had
the
management
of
athletics
and
of
the
forthcoming
cricket
or
football
season
two
librarians
and
a
keeper
of
the
in
addition
to
this
when
any
of
the
prefects
left
fresh
ones
were
chosen
in
their
places
only
members
of
the
sixth
form
were
eligible
for
this
office
which
was
not
conferred
before
the
choice
of
the
boys
had
been
confirmed
by
the
sanction
of
the
and
was
understood
to
last
for
the
remainder
of
the
recipient
school
life
on
the
second
or
third
morning
of
the
term
a
paper
was
posted
up
on
the
in
the
big
schoolroom
announcing
the
fact
that
the
elections
would
take
place
two
days
later
and
mentioning
exactly
what
each
voter
was
required
to
do
every
boy
who
had
been
two
terms
at
the
school
received
a
voting
paper
which
he
filled
up
at
his
leisure
and
handed
over
to
the
returning
officers
at
a
special
assembly
called
for
the
purpose
at
the
commencement
of
this
particular
winter
term
the
school
reassembled
on
a
tuesday
and
on
thursday
notice
was
given
that
the
elections
would
take
place
on
the
following
saturday
afternoon
according
to
the
usual
custom
when
fresh
prefects
were
to
be
chosen
the
names
of
all
the
sixth
form
boys
who
were
not
already
holding
that
office
were
mentioned
on
the
notice
to
show
who
were
eligible
for
the
position
thurston
name
did
not
appear
on
the
list
some
one
added
it
in
pencil
another
hand
crossed
it
out
and
an
hour
or
two
later
it
was
added
again
this
time
in
red
ink
this
simple
action
seemed
the
signal
for
a
general
agitation
on
thurston
behalf
his
friends
throughout
the
school
openly
proclaimed
their
intention
of
voting
for
him
and
exhorted
others
to
do
the
same
almost
to
a
man
the
sixth
and
remove
sided
with
the
captain
but
hawley
and
gull
in
the
fifth
noaks
and
mouler
in
the
upper
fourth
and
other
fellows
in
the
lower
forms
made
up
their
minds
to
secure
return
and
set
to
work
to
carry
out
their
project
with
a
zeal
worthy
of
a
better
cause
two
fresh
prefects
were
required
and
the
friends
of
law
and
order
were
unanimous
in
naming
fielding
and
parkes
as
the
most
suitable
candidates
to
fill
the
vacancies
rival
posters
appeared
on
the
double
doors
leading
to
the
playground
remember
the
wraxby
match
and
vote
for
thurston
plump
for
parkes
and
have
a
proper
prefect
but
this
method
of
carrying
on
the
campaign
was
soon
brought
into
disrepute
owing
to
the
fact
that
certain
juveniles
seeing
in
this
new
idea
of
a
fresh
field
for
practical
joking
began
to
adorn
the
walls
of
the
and
other
spaces
which
did
not
often
come
under
the
eye
of
a
master
with
placards
exhibiting
inscriptions
which
had
no
bearing
on
the
elections
such
irrelevant
remarks
as
nooks
two
wants
kicking
or
wits
signed
bibbs
being
calculated
to
occasion
a
considerable
amount
of
strife
and
bad
blood
without
serving
any
useful
purpose
the
lower
school
was
in
a
fever
heat
of
excitement
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
little
pleasantries
which
have
just
been
alluded
to
were
occasioned
by
difference
of
opinion
on
the
one
absorbing
topic
of
the
day
the
close
of
the
previous
holidays
had
witnessed
a
general
parliamentary
election
and
with
the
details
of
contests
which
had
taken
place
in
their
native
towns
vividly
impressed
upon
their
minds
the
younger
boys
from
the
lower
fourth
downwards
threw
themselves
into
the
present
conflict
with
an
amount
of
energy
and
spirit
which
was
not
to
be
found
in
the
more
sober
and
deliberate
action
of
their
seniors
the
greater
number
of
the
old
happy
family
had
now
been
removed
into
the
lower
fourth
and
this
form
in
particular
was
rent
with
opposing
views
and
shaken
with
continued
outbursts
of
hostility
between
the
rival
factions
the
triple
alliance
were
loyal
to
the
old
and
were
supported
by
rats
carton
and
several
of
their
old
friends
acton
saved
us
from
getting
into
a
row
after
that
business
remarked
diggory
rowland
gave
noaks
a
dressing
down
when
he
hit
me
in
the
mouth
said
jack
vance
and
old
ally
boxed
mouler
ears
when
they
made
me
upset
that
paint
added
mugford
rats
declared
that
he
meant
to
conduct
what
he
called
a
visitation
and
accordingly
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
the
form
the
first
person
he
called
upon
was
grundy
a
great
lout
of
sixteen
who
had
been
at
the
tail
end
of
the
lower
fourth
for
the
last
twelve
months
as
it
happened
grundy
was
a
strong
partisan
of
the
opposite
side
and
not
only
refused
to
vote
for
parkes
but
seizing
hold
of
the
unfortunate
canvasser
proceeded
to
twist
his
arms
and
pinch
his
ears
for
daring
to
oppose
the
election
of
thurston
fletcher
two
whose
sympathies
as
might
have
been
expected
were
with
his
brother
chum
organized
meetings
in
one
corner
of
the
field
where
the
big
could
be
used
as
a
platform
but
here
again
the
love
of
larking
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
lawless
small
boy
came
into
evidence
and
with
that
touch
of
nature
which
makes
the
whole
world
kin
friend
and
foe
alike
joined
in
the
spree
of
interrupting
the
proceedings
just
when
the
orator
had
reached
the
most
important
point
in
his
harangue
and
was
pouring
forth
a
torrent
of
impassioned
eloquence
the
platform
would
begin
to
move
or
the
audience
would
insist
on
turning
the
gathering
into
an
imaginary
scrum
and
almost
crushing
the
life
out
of
those
who
happened
to
be
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd
poor
bibbs
especially
became
a
target
for
the
humour
of
the
electors
according
to
fletcher
instructions
he
had
written
out
a
speech
and
learned
it
by
heart
but
though
he
was
being
continually
called
upon
to
deliver
it
he
never
got
beyond
the
opening
ahem
gentlemen
before
a
sudden
movement
of
the
platform
precipitated
him
into
the
arms
of
his
irreverent
hearers
or
a
shout
of
play
up
at
the
followed
by
a
shower
of
acorns
bits
of
stick
and
pieces
of
turf
caused
him
to
jump
down
and
hastily
seek
shelter
behind
the
roller
for
two
days
especially
in
the
lower
school
the
excitement
continued
steadily
to
increase
and
small
boys
being
seized
in
corners
were
made
to
assert
at
one
time
that
they
would
vote
for
thurston
and
at
another
that
they
would
vote
for
parkes
or
fielding
and
so
in
order
to
escape
with
a
whole
skin
were
forced
to
commit
perjury
at
least
a
dozen
times
between
the
hours
of
breakfast
and
tea
one
incident
which
as
far
as
the
lower
fourth
was
concerned
tended
considerably
to
embitter
the
contest
is
worthy
of
record
as
a
notable
feature
of
this
memorable
campaign
the
occupants
of
dormitory
no
were
rabid
thurstonians
dormitory
no
on
the
other
hand
in
which
slept
the
triple
alliance
maxton
rats
and
carton
were
to
a

supporters
of
parkes
and
fielding
on
friday
evening
the
two
doors
which
were
exactly
opposite
to
each
other
being
left
open
the
process
of
undressing
was
enlivened
by
a
continual
fire
of
abuse
and
insulting
remarks
which
might
have
led
to
a
regular
scrimmage
between
the
two
parties
if
the
presence
of
the
prefect
patrolling
the
passage
had
not
prevented
either
side
from
advancing
beyond
the
threshold
of
their
own
doorway
i
would
vote
for
a
chap
like
thurston
who
goes
boozing
in
a
common
like
the
black
swan
cried
rats
but
that
just
the
sort
of
man
for
you
you
a
cheap
lot
the
whole
crew
of
you
look
here
young
retorted
fletcher
junior
from
the
opposite
room
wandering
rather
wide
of
the
subject
in
hand
why
do
you
write
home
and
ask
your
people
to
buy
you
a
new
pair
of
braces
instead
of
mending
those
old
ones
up
with
string
you
look
just
like
a
young
street
arab
and
that
about
what
you
are
do
you
fellows
talk
about
broken
braces
and
looking
like
street
arabs
cried
diggory
when
only
yesterday
old
greyling
sent
stokes
out
of
class
and
told
him
to
go
down
to
the
lavatory
and
wash
his
face
that
a
sample
of
you
thurstonians
look
here
shouted
the
boy
alluded
to
springing
out
of
bed
and
appearing
in
his
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
dormitory
you
know
very
well
that
grundy
flipped
a
pen
full
of
ink
over
me
and
that
was
why
i
had
to
go
out
and
wash
my
face
i
know
you
looked
altogether
a
different
fellow
when
you
came
back
returned
jack
vance
i
hardly
knew
you
there
was
a
momentary
pause
in
the
discussion
and
bibbs
thinking
this
a
suitable
opportunity
for
the
delivery
of
his
speech
stepped
forward
and
took
up
his
stand
in
the
doorway
hardly
however
had
he
pronounced
the
opening
ahem
gentlemen
when
a
cake
of
soap
flung
by
maxton
struck
him
a
violent
blow
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
and
he
was
still
rolling
and
groaning
on
his
bed
in
the
throes
of
recovering
his
lost
wind
when
the
prefect
arrived
to
turn
out
the
light
the
occupants
of
the
two
dormitories
lay
down
but
not
to
sleep
you
mark
my
word
said
diggory
as
soon
as
the
prefects
have
gone
down
to
supper
those
chaps
from
over
the
way
come
across
and
pay
us
out
for
throwing
that
soap
we
better
put
a
chair
against
the
door
look
here
remarked
fletcher
junior
to
his
i
be
at
all
surprised
if
maxton
and
those
other
fellows
in
no
come
over
and
try
to
rag
us
let
lie
awake
a
bit
and
listen
for
half
an
hour
all
was
quiet
and
still
and
the
watchers
in
no
were
turning
over
and
preparing
to
go
to
sleep
when
rats
started
up
exclaiming
in
a
whisper
they
coming
i
heard
some
one
in
the
passage
there
is
again
jump
up
you
chaps
and
let
make
a
sortie
now
strange
to
say
an
exactly
similar
alarm
had
just
been
given
by
fletcher
junior
in
no
and
the
reason
was
simply
as
follows
greyling
the
master
of
the
lower
fourth
in
walking
towards
his
bedroom
in
slippered
feet
was
seized
with
a
sneezing
fit
and
halting
just
outside
the
two
dormitories
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
with
a
loud
after
a
moment
pause
he
sneezed
again
and
had
hardly
done
so
before
both
doors
were
suddenly
flung
open
and
with
a
cry
of
ah
you
sneaks
and
another
of
come
on
you
blackguards
a
crowd
of
figures
rushed
out
brandishing
pillows
and
startling
greyling
to
such
a
degree
that
he
exclaimed
great
scott
and
dropped
his
candle
what
followed
is
too
sad
to
be
related
in
detail
greyling
scattered
largess
in
the
shape
of
lines
among
the
crowd
and
the
next
day
the
occupants
of
the
two
dormitories
went
about
thirsting
for
each
other
blood
on
saturday
just
before
morning
school
the
voting
papers
were
collected
and
directly
after
dinner
the
boys
assembled
to
hear
the
result
of
the
poll
according
to
the
usual
custom
no
masters
were
present
allingford
presided
and
the
excitement
was
intense
a
hush
of
expectation
fell
on
the
crowded
room
as
the
captain
mounted
the
platform
on
which
stood
the
desk
up
to
the
present
time
elections
at
ronleigh
had
been
little
more
than
a
matter
of
form
but
on
this
occasion
every
one
felt
that
something
more
was
at
stake
than
the
mere
distribution
of
the
school
offices
gentlemen
the
business
of
this
meeting
as
you
are
very
well
aware
is
to
announce
the
result
of
the
elections
the
following
continued
allingford
referring
to
the
paper
which
he
held
in
his
hand
have
been
chosen
to
act
as
the
sports
committee
myself
chairman
oaks
acton
rowland
parkes
redfern
and
hoyle
the
two
former
librarians
clarkson
and
lang
have
been
dale
who
for
some
time
past
held
the
position
of
keeper
of
the
having
left
the
choice
of
a
successor
has
fallen
between
lucas
and
ferris
who
singularly
enough
both
received
the
same
number
of
votes
each
of
these
gentlemen
being
equally
ready
to
withdraw
in
the
other
favour
i
exercised
my
prerogative
as
captain
of
the
school
and
gave
the
casting
vote
in
favour
of
lucas
at
this
there
was
a
slight
murmur
among
the
audience
though
whether
of
dissent
or
approval
it
was
impossible
to
tell
the
interruption
was
only
momentary
for
every
one
was
too
much
interested
in
the
next
announcement
to
care
much
what
became
of
the
post
of
keeper
of
the
as
you
all
know
two
vacancies
have
occurred
among
the
prefects
to
fill
which
the
following
gentlemen
have
been
chosen
and
their
election
duly
sanctioned
by
the
parkes
and
fielding
the
words
had
hardly
passed
the
speaker
lips
when
the
whole
room
was
in
an
uproar
cheers
howls
whistling
and
the
stamping
of
feet
filled
the
air
with
an
indescribable
din
members
of
the
lower
fourth
fought
one
another
across
the
desks
and
it
was
some
minutes
before
allingford
could
obtain
sufficient
silence
to
enable
him
to
finish
his
speech
this
he
said
in
conclusion
is
the
result
of
the
present
election
i
believe
there
has
been
some
little
difference
of
opinion
among
you
especially
in
regard
to
the
selection
of
the
two
fresh
prefects
there
are
so
many
worthy
fellows
in
the
sixth
that
one
can
hardly
wonder
at
your
finding
some
difficulty
in
making
your
choice
one
thing
is
certain
namely
that
the
two
gentlemen
who
have
been
elected
to
what
is
and
always
has
been
a
very
honourable
position
at
ronleigh
are
eminently
fitted
for
the
work
the
duties
of
a
prefect
are
often
difficult
and
the
reverse
of
pleasant
but
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
when
i
say
that
in
any
large
school
it
is
eminently
satisfactory
to
find
that
a
certain
amount
of
the
government
and
discipline
can
be
entrusted
to
the
boys
themselves
and
i
feel
sure
that
you
will
give
parkes
and
fielding
the
same
willing
support
as
you
have
always
accorded
to
myself
and
the
other
prefects
as
the
captain
finished
speaking
hawley
gull
noaks
and
several
other
boys
sprang
to
their
feet
their
appearance
being
the
signal
for
a
fresh
outburst
of
cheers
and
groans
young
rats
commenced
to
hiss
like
a
small
while
grundy
made
frantic
but
futile
attempts
to
reach
over
from
the
desk
behind
and
smite
him
on
the
head
with
a
french
dictionary
if
any
one
wishes
to
speak
said
the
chairman
he
is
at
liberty
to
do
so
but
of
course
we
ca
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
with
the
exception
of
hawley
those
who
had
risen
sat
down
again
i
want
to
ask
said
the
former
what
were
the
numbers
in
the
voting
for
the
prefects
parkes
received
votes
and
fielding
did
thurston
receive
any
votes
yes
how
many
that
returned
the
captain
is
a
question
which
for
certain
reasons
i
think
it
would
be
best
not
to
answer
i
think
interrupted
gull
rising
to
his
feet
amid
a
murmur
of
excitement
that
we
have
a
perfect
right
to
insist
on
the
figures
being
made
public
everything
in
connection
with
these
elections
ought
to
be
fair
and
open
i
do
think
answered
allingford
quietly
that
any
one
has
ever
had
reason
to
accuse
me
of
being
unfair
in
any
of
my
dealings
it
is
exactly
because
i
think
it
would
be
hardly
fair
to
thurston
himself
that
i
propose
not
to
publish
the
number
of
votes
awarded
to
unsuccessful
candidates
the
subject
of
this
remark
sat
in
the
front
row
but
one
lolling
back
against
the
desk
behind
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
a
sneering
smile
on
his
lips
i
do
care
what
you
do
he
exclaimed
with
a
short
laugh
i
can
guess
pretty
well
what
coming
there
cried
gull
you
hear
what
thurston
says
now
let
have
the
figures
very
well
answered
the
captain
if
you
insist
you
shall
have
them
the
number
of
votes
for
thurston
was
then
if
he
got
more
votes
than
either
parkes
or
fielding
why
is
he
elected
because
the
doctor
would
not
sanction
it
the
names
have
to
be
submitted
to
him
for
approval
and
he
appointed
parkes
and
fielding
did
you
try
to
influence
him
to
overlook
thurston
demanded
gull
angrily
but
an
immediate
outburst
of
such
cries
as
shame
shut
up
and
sit
down
showed
the
speaker
he
had
gone
too
far
and
rendered
it
unnecessary
for
allingford
to
reply
to
the
question
i
think
said
fletcher
senior
rising
to
his
feet
when
this
interruption
had
ceased
and
looking
round
with
a
foxy
smile
on
his
face
that
with
all
due
respect
to
the
gentlemen
who
have
been
elected
as
prefects
it
is
a
great
pity
that
the
doctor
should
not
have
consented
to
confirm
the
choice
of
the
school
and
reappoint
thurston
i
think
if
the
matter
were
laid
before
him
in
a
proper
light
he
might
be
induced
to
reconsider
his
decision
well
will
you
go
and
see
him
about
it
yourself
asked
allingford
with
a
slight
sneer
no
of
course
i
should
go
alone
returned
fletcher
i
think
a
matter
that
should
be
taken
up
by
the
whole
school
there
was
a
moment
lull
in
the
proceedings
broken
only
by
a
confused
murmur
of
voices
then
acton
jumped
to
his
feet
the
football
captain
was
popular
with
everybody
and
the
sight
of
his
jovial
face
and
sturdy
figure
was
greeted
with
a
burst
of
cheers
look
here
you
fellows
he
began
i
no
speaker
but
i
can
say
enough
to
serve
the
purpose
i
think
we
are
very
much
indebted
to
our
captain
not
only
for
presiding
over
this
meeting
but
for
what
he
has
done
and
is
always
doing
for
the
good
of
the
school
i
remember
ronleigh
when
it
was
such
a
decent
place
as
it
is
a
lot
of
things
went
on
here
when
i
was
a
kid
that
would
be
put
up
with
now
and
i
do
think
the
school
ever
played
such
good
games
of
cricket
and
football
as
we
see
at
the
present
time
a
lot
of
this
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
is
due
to
our
captain
and
i
think
we
ca
show
our
appreciation
of
his
work
in
a
better
way
than
by
giving
him
three
cheers
now
then
take
the
time
from
me
three
cheers
for
allingford
hip
hip
hurrah
the
big
assembly
shouted
till
the
roof
rang
and
the
windows
rattled
then
the
meeting
slowly
dispersed
a
feeble
attempt
to
raise
three
cheers
for
thurston
being
met
with
as
many
groans
as
plaudits
chapter
xiv
a
passage
of
arms
the
triple
alliance
in
common
with
the
rest
of
their
schoolfellows
little
thought
on
returning
from
their
summer
holidays
what
a
memorable
epoch
the
coming
term
would
prove
in
the
history
of
ronleigh
college
still
less
did
any
one
imagine
what
important
results
would
arise
from
the
action
of
the
three
friends
and
how
much
would
depend
on
the
loyalty
of
these
youngsters
for
their
they
settled
down
to
enjoy
a
peaceful
thirteen
weeks
of
work
and
play
jack
vance
reported
that
the
robbery
of
the
hermit
coins
was
regarded
at
todderton
as
quite
a
piece
of
ancient
history
and
as
noaks
appeared
to
have
forgotten
the
existence
of
the
and
growing
every
day
more
intimate
with
thurston
and
seemed
more
than
ever
inclined
to
go
his
way
and
leave
his
former
foes
alone
the
latter
made
up
their
minds
to
banish
dull
care
and
consider
their
unfortunate
misadventure
as
a
storm
which
they
had
safely
weathered
the
wave
of
excitement
caused
by
the
elections
soon
passed
over
the
new
prefects
entered
upon
their
duties
and
in
the
performance
of
the
same
apparently
met
with
no
or
opposition
yet
to
every
keen
observer
it
was
evident
that
the
recent
contest
had
left
behind
it
a
distinct
of
dissatisfaction
and
for
the
first
time
in
the
memory
of
all
concerned
ronleigh
was
a
house
divided
against
itself
no
longer
united
in
a
common
cause
but
split
into
two
factions
one
pulling
against
the
other
thinking
more
of
party
interests
than
of
the
honour
and
welfare
of
the
whole
community
the
first
occasion
on
which
this
spirit
clearly
manifested
itself
was
some
ten
days
after
the
elections
when
the
college
played
their
first
football
match
of
the
season
against
ronleigh
town
thurston
name
had
as
usual
been
included
in
the
list
of
the
eleven
which
was
posted
up
on
wednesday
morning
but
before
school
was
over
it
was
noised
abroad
that
he
had
refused
to
play
i
say
you
fellows
have
you
heard
about
said
fletcher
junior
as
the
lower
fourth
straggled
into
their
classroom
after
interval
i
wonder
if
it
true
oh
it
true
enough
answered
grundy
from
the
back
desk
and
jolly
glad
he
done
it
i
heard
him
say
this
morning
that
if
allingford
and
those
other
fellows
would
put
up
with
him
as
a
prefect
they
should
have
him
in
the
team
well
i
call
that
rot
cried
jack
vance
the
team
does
belong
to
allingford
or
to
anybody
else
oh
shut
your
mouth
you
young
prig
interrupted
grundy
and
the
entrance
of
greyling
put
a
stop
to
any
further
conversation
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
a
much
nobler
spirit
would
pervade
such
as
cricket
and
football
if
the
fact
could
be
more
firmly
impressed
upon
the
minds
of
both
players
and
spectators
that
providing
the
conduct
of
each
side
is
fair
and
generous
and
that
every
one
does
his
big
best
it
is
equally
creditable
to
lose
as
to
win
certainly
both
sides
should
strive
their
hardest
to
gain
the
day
but
let
boys
especially
remember
in
an
uphill
game
when
scoring
goes
against
them
that
it
is
to
the
honour
of
the
slaughtered
spartans
and
not
of
the
victorious
persians
that
the
pass
of
thermopylae
has
become
a
household
word
in
addition
to
the
loss
of
thurston
who
to
do
him
justice
was
a
very
good
forward
the
school
team
was
weakened
still
further
by
an
unfortunate
accident
which
befell
rowlands
who
twisted
his
ankle
and
was
forced
to
leave
the
ground
at
the
very
commencement
of
the
game
the
town
were
unusually
strong
and
the
bulk
of
the
back
work
fell
on
allingford
the
captain
played
a
magnificent
game
and
covered
himself
with
glory
but
in
spite
of
all
that
he
and
his
men
could
do
after
a
gallant
fight
the
visitors
claimed
the
victory
with
a
score
of
four
goals
to
two
on
the
morning
after
the
match
just
before
school
the
members
of
the
triple
alliance
were
strolling
across
the
when
they
noticed
a
crowd
of
boys
surrounding
the
the
gathering
seemed
to
consist
mainly
of
members
of
the
lower
classes
and
the
manner
in
which
they
were
elbowing
each
other
aside
laughing
talking
and
gesticulating
showed
that
some
announcement
of
rather
uncommon
interest
and
importance
must
be
exposed
to
view
our
three
friends
hurried
forward
to
join
the
group
pinned
to
the
board
with
an
old
was
a
of
and
inscribed
thereon
in
what
was
evidently
a
disguised
handwriting
were
some
verses
which
were
seen
at
once
to
refer
to
the
previous
afternoon
defeat
they
were
as
follows

of
the
college
was
allingford
spoke
when
we
play
the
town
team
there
are
heads
to
be
broke
so
let
ten
veteran
players
come
now
follow
me
and
fight
for
the
honour
of
ancient
ronleigh
then
put
up
your
and
mark
your
we
grind
them
to
powder
and
put
them
in
brine
let
boarders
and
day
boys
all
come
out
to
see
us
fight
for
the
honour
of
ancient
ronleigh
the
ten
merry
men
mustered
quick
at
his
call
there
were
forwards
and
and
tall
but
one
who
was
wont
in
the
forefront
to
be
no
longer
was
seen
in
the
ranks
of
ronleigh
then
put
up
your
and
mark
etc
too
soon
their
rejoicings
and
empty
their
boast
for
the
town
fellows
very
soon
had
them
on
toast
and
the
bystanders
sighed
as
they
saw
frequently
the
ball
pass
the
back
of
our
ancient
ronleigh
then
put
up
your
and
mark
etc
from
this
draw
a
moral
you
fellows
who
rule
sink
personal
spite
when
you
act
for
the
school
and
whatever
your
notions
of
prefects
may
be
let
have
the
right
men
in
the
team
at
ronleigh
then
put
up
your
and
mark
etc
something
in
these
doggerel
lines
excited
jack
vance
wrath
above
measure
the
last
verse
especially
raising
his
anger
to
so
that
it
fairly
bubbled
over
jack
was
a
youngster
he
was
nothing
to
allingford
but
allingford
was
something
to
him
as
head
and
leader
of
the
community
of
which
he
himself
was
a
member
the
sight
of
the
captain
toiling
manfully
through
the
long
unequal
contest
of
the
previous
afternoon
doing
practically
double
work
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
his
and
to
prevent
a
losing
game
degenerating
into
a
rout
rose
up
once
more
before
the
small
boy
mind
and
as
has
been
said
before
his
wrath
boiled
over
well
i
call
that
a
beastly
shame
the
chap
who
wrote
it
ought
to
be
kicked
round
the
field
my
eye
cried
grundy
listen
to
what
talking
kicked
round
the
field
indeed
why
i
think
it
jolly
good
it
serves
allingford
and
those
other
fellows
just
right
for
turning
thurston
out
of
the
team
what
a
lie
retorted
jack
you
know
very
well
they
did
turn
him
out
he
went
out
of
his
own
accord
here
do
give
me
any
of
your
cheek
said
grundy
sidling
up
to
his
antagonist
in
a
threatening
manner
you
mean
to
say
i
a
liar
eh
the
advent
of
three
fifth
form
boys
one
of
whom
took
grundy
by
the
shoulders
and
pushed
him
away
with
the
command
to
get
out
and
lie
on
the
mat
put
an
end
for
the
time
being
to
the
altercation
the
crowd
increased
boys
of
all
ages
stopped
to
read
the
verses
some
few
laughed
and
pronounced
them
jolly
good
but
to
do
them
justice
the
greater
number
of
ronleians
were
too
jealous
of
the
honour
of
their
school
to
see
much
fun
in
this
attempt
to
lampoon
their
football
representatives
just
as
the
bell
was
ringing
for
assembly
the
paper
was
torn
down
by
trail
the
head
of
the
remove
who
ripped
it
up
into
fifty
pieces
and
in
answer
to
gull
inquiry
what
he
did
that
for
replied
i
jolly
soon
show
you
in
such
a
menacing
tone
that
the
questioner
saw
fit
to
turn
on
his
heel
and
walk
away
with
an
alacrity
of
movement
not
altogether
due
to
any
particular
eagerness
to
commence
work
the
lower
fourth
were
straggling
down
the
passage
on
the
way
to
their
classroom
when
they
heard
a
scuffle
and
the
clatter
of
falling
books
grundy
had
seized
jack
vance
by
the
collar
from
behind
and
was
screwing
his
knuckle
into
his
victim
neck
yes
you
called
me
a
liar
did
you
so
you
are
let
go
my
coat
oh
so
you
stick
to
it
do
you
i
the
sentence
was
interrupted
by
jack
giving
a
sudden
twist
and
striking
his
antagonist
a
heavy
blow
in
the
chest
which
sent
him
staggering
against
the
opposite
wall
grundy
was
nearly
a
head
taller
than
vance
but
the
latter
blood
was
up
and
in
another
moment
the
dogs
of
war
would
have
assuredly
broken
loose
had
not
the
flutter
of
a
gown
at
the
end
of
the
passage
announced
the
advent
of
greyling
the
class
had
finished
translating
from
their
latin
author
and
had
just
commenced
writing
an
exercise
when
a
note
was
passed
over
to
jack
vance
from
the
desk
behind
it
was
short
and
to
the
point
will
you
fight
me
after
twelve
at
the
back
of
the
pavilion
h
grundy
jack
read
the
challenge
turned
round
and
nodded
and
then
went
calmly
on
with
his
work
as
though
nothing
had
happened
this
cool
way
of
treating
the
matter
did
not
altogether
please
grundy
who
had
rather
expected
that
his
adversary
would
elect
to
take
a
licking
he
had
however
every
reason
to
count
upon
an
easy
victory
and
so
promptly
despatched
another
note
which
contained
the
words
very
well
i
smash
you
later
on
a
third
epistle
was
handed
over
do
tell
any
one
or
there
be
too
much
of
a
crowd
it
was
not
until
the
interval
that
the
two
other
members
of
the
triple
alliance
were
informed
of
the
coming
conflict
you
do
really
mean
you
going
to
fight
him
said
mugford
of
course
i
am
you
get
licked
added
diggory
with
a
sigh
i
do
care
if
i
am
if
i
land
him
one
or
two
he
wo
be
in
a
hurry
to
lick
me
again
do
you
remember
what
you
said
ages
ago
at
the
birches
diggy
when
you
went
down
that
slide
on
skates
well
it
the
same
thing
with
me
now
i
going
to
show
him
once
and
for
all
that
he
not
going
to
ride
over
me
for
nothing
during
the
last
hour
of
school
which
happened
to
be
devoted
to
algebra
the
only
member
of
the
triple
alliance
who
seemed
able
to
work
was
jack
vance
diggory
made
a
hash
of
nearly
every
sum
while
mugford
simply
collapsed
and
could
not
even
remember
that
like
signs
made
and
unlike
i
say
diggy
whispered
the
latter
do
you
think
grundy
lick
him
i
do
know
returned
the
other
with
a
desperate
attempt
to
be
cheerful
you
never
know
what
may
happen
he
may
trevanock
stop
talking
interrupted
greyling
if
i
have
to
speak
to
you
again
for
inattention
you
stay
in
and
work
out
these
examples
after
twelve
at
length
the
faint
jangle
of
the
bell
announced
the
fact
that
the
eventful
hour
had
arrived
the
lower
fourth
passed
on
into
the
big
schoolroom
and
were
dismissed
with
the
other
classes
jack
betrayed
not
the
least
sign
of
excitement
and
insisted
on
going
down
into
the
to
feed
two
white
mice
before
setting
out
for
the
front
his
two
friends
however
weighed
down
with
anxiety
and
with
dismal
forebodings
as
to
the
result
of
the
coming
conflict
were
obliged
to
seek
support
by
informing
rats
of
what
was
about
to
take
place
and
begging
him
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
his
cheering
company
young
rats
who
was
always
ready
to
take
part
in
anything
from
a
garden
party
to
a
game
of
marbles
immediately
accepted
the
invitation
jolly
glad
you
told
me
he
cried
would
have
missed
seeing
it
for
anything
jack
vance
and
grundy
the
long
whistle
with
which
he
concluded
the
sentence
had
certainly
an
ominous
sound
but
the
appearance
of
their
principal
was
the
signal
for
the
seconds
to
hide
their
fears
under
an
assumed
air
of
jovial
confidence
you
be
certain
to
lick
him
jack
said
diggory
with
a
face
as
long
as
a
fiddle
wo
he
lick
him
answered
rats
i
should
think
so
lick
him
into
fits
i
could
do
it
myself
he
a
beastly
bully
added
mugford
solemnly
and
bullies
always
get
licked
in
books
i
do
care
answered
jack
jauntily
if
i
lick
him
or
not
but
i
know
he
find
me
a
pretty
hard
nut
to
crack
ronleigh
had
no
recognized
but
when
a
premeditated
encounter
did
take
place
the
combatants
usually
resorted
to
a
little
patch
of
grass
situated
between
the
back
of
the
pavilion
and
the
edge
of
the
adjoining
field
here
it
was
possible
to
conduct
an
affair
of
honour
without
much
fear
of
interruption
grundy
was
already
at
the
accompanied
by
andson
a
chum
from
the
upper
fourth
and
fletcher
junior
it
was
quite
an
informal
little
gathering
and
the
business
was
conducted
in
a
manner
and
with
an
entire
absence
of
the
ceremony
which
characterized
similar
undertakings
in
the
palmy
days
of
the
prize
ring
look
here
young
vance
said
grundy
if
you
like
to
apologize
for
calling
me
a
liar
i
let
you
off
if
not
i
going
to
punch
your
head
punch
away
answered
jack
stolidly
and
all
further
attempt
at
pacification
was
abandoned
the
principals
took
off
their
coats
and
collars
while
their
companions
drew
aside
to
give
them
room
and
the
signal
was
given
to
commence
the
action
grundy
made
no
attempt
at
any
display
of
science
he
simply
relied
on
his
superior
strength
and
size
and
charged
down
upon
his
adversary
with
the
intention
of
thumping
and
pounding
him
till
he
gave
in
jack
vance
knew
very
little
about
the
noble
art
except
that
it
was
the
proper
thing
to
hit
straight
from
the
shoulder
and
following
out
this
fundamental
principle
he
succeeded
in
landing
his
opponent
a
good
hard
drive
between
the
eyes
which
made
him
see
more
stars
than
are
to
be
witnessed
at
the
explosion
of
a
sixpenny
rocket
grundy
drew
back
and
after
blinking
and
rubbing
his
nose
for
a
moment
came
on
again
this
time
with
greater
caution
jack
on
the
other
hand
emboldened
by
his
previous
success
made
an
unwise
attempt
to
rush
the
fighting
and
was
rewarded
with
a
sounding
smack
on
the
which
broke
the
skin
and
sent
him
staggering
back
into
the
arms
of
diggory
once
more
the
combatants
approached
each
other
this
time
with
a
little
more
feinting
and
dodging
which
showed
a
certain
amount
of
respect
for
the
weight
of
each
other
fists
at
length
urged
on
to
further
feats
of
arms
by
impatient
ejaculations
of
now
then
go
into
it
and
keep
the
game
alive
from
fletcher
and
andson
they
closed
again
and
after
a
sharp
interchange
of
rather
random
pounding
jack
smote
his
opponent
on
the
nose
and
received
in
return
a
heavy
blow
on
the
chest
which
very
nearly
sent
him
to
the
ground
after
this
there
was
another
short
a
thin
stream
of
blood
was
trickling
from
grundy
nasal
organ
while
diggory
and
mugford
noticed
with
aching
hearts
that
their
comrade
was
beginning
to
look
rather
limp
and
was
getting
short
of
breath
what
would
have
been
the
ultimate
result
of
the
contest
had
it
been
resumed
i
am
sure
i
can
not
say
but
i
fear
that
taking
superior
weight
and
height
into
consideration
the
story
of
the
fight
would
have
been
recorded
among
the
trials
and
not
the
triumphs
of
the
triple
alliance
as
it
was
a
sudden
interruption
brought
the
encounter
to
a
premature
close
hullo
you
young
beggars
what
are
you
up
to
the
voice
was
that
of
allingford
who
attracted
by
cries
of
go
it
give
him
another
bravo
vance
and
other
warlike
shouts
had
hurried
round
to
the
rear
of
the
pavilion
to
find
out
what
was
happening
hullo
he
continued
stepping
forward
and
grasping
grundy
by
the
shoulder
what
up
what
the
joke
it
only
a
bit
of
a
fight
said
andson
they
had
a
row
this
morning
what
mean
to
say
you
fighting
that
youngster
why
do
you
choose
some
one
a
bit
smaller
demanded
the
captain
rather
bitterly
well
it
his
own
doing
growled
grundy
i
offered
to
let
him
off
but
he
wanted
to
have
it
out
pshaw
returned
the
other
look
here
i
half
a
mind
to
give
you
two
a
jolly
good
to
keep
you
out
of
mischief
now
stop
it
hear
or
i
send
both
your
names
in
to
denson
fletcher
and
andson
had
already
beaten
a
retreat
and
grundy
was
preparing
to
follow
when
allingford
called
him
back
come
he
said
in
a
kinder
tone
i
do
know
what
your
about
but
finish
it
up
like
men
and
shake
hands
the
boys
did
as
they
were
told
and
though
the
salutation
was
not
a
very
hearty
one
it
helped
to
extinguish
the
smouldering
sparks
of
anger
which
might
at
some
future
meeting
have
been
once
more
fanned
into
a
flame
grundy
disappeared
round
the
corner
of
the
building
but
allingford
remained
for
a
moment
or
two
watching
jack
vance
as
he
fastened
on
his
collar
and
resumed
his
coat
well
what
was
the
row
about
oh
nothing
nonsense
fellows
do
fight
for
nothing
what
was
it
any
great
secret
oh
no
answered
jack
laughing
it
began
about
that
lot
of
verses
that
was
pinned
upon
the
this
morning
grundy
said
thurston
was
turned
out
of
the
team
and
i
said
he
was
the
captain
smiled
thoughtfully
and
going
down
on
one
knee
examined
the
wounded
cheek
put
some
cold
water
to
it
he
said
and
then
walked
away
that
look
was
worth
fifty
bruises
and
for
it
jack
would
have
continued
the
fight
with
grundy
to
the
bitter
end
diggory
and
mugford
fell
upon
his
neck
and
were
loud
in
their
declarations
that
in
another
round
their
champion
would
have
knocked
the
stuffing
out
of
his
opponent
that
this
would
really
have
been
the
case
is
as
i
remarked
before
rather
doubtful
but
one
fact
is
certain
that
the
conflict
caused
the
three
friends
to
be
more
firmly
established
than
ever
in
their
loyalty
to
the
side
of
law
and
order
for
a
couple
of
days
fellows
continued
to
talk
about
the
skit
on
the
eleven
and
to
hazard
guesses
as
to
who
was
the
writer
as
the
majority
however
pronounced
it
a
dirty
shame
and
spoke
of
the
author
as
some
mean
skunk
the
poet
wisely
concluded
to
conceal
his
identity
and
by
the
end
of
the
week
the
matter
was
for
the
time
being
practically
forgotten
chapter
xv
the
riot
thurston
followed
up
his
withdrawal
from
the
football
team
by
a
number
of
other
actions
which
clearly
showed
a
determination
to
spend
what
was
known
to
be
his
last
term
at
ronleigh
in
living
at
open
enmity
with
those
who
had
once
been
his
friends
and
associates
he
never
played
unless
it
was
in
one
of
the
practice
games
composed
chiefly
of
stragglers
who
from
being
kept
in
and
various
other
causes
were
too
late
for
the
regular
and
came
drifting
on
to
the
field
later
in
the
afternoon
he
severed
his
connection
with
the
debating
society
and
shunning
the
society
of
his
comrades
in
the
sixth
was
seen
more
frequently
than
ever
hobnobbing
with
gull
and
hawley
or
lounging
about
in
conversation
with
noaks
and
mouler
fletcher
senior
a
mean
fellow
continued
as
the
saying
goes
to
run
with
the
hare
and
hunt
with
the
hounds
it
an
awful
pity
about
old
he
would
say
to
his
brother
prefects
i
try
to
keep
him
a
bit
straight
but
upon
my
word
if
he
will
go
on
being
so
friendly
with
such
cads
as
gull
and
noaks
i
shall
chuck
him
altogether
the
speaker
methods
of
endeavouring
to
keep
his
chum
straight
were
to
say
the
least
of
it
not
very
effective
and
if
anything
rather
more
calculated
to
encourage
him
still
further
in
his
descent
along
the
downward
road
look
here
said
fletcher
as
they
sat
one
evening
talking
in
thurston
study
do
you
think
you
better
make
peace
with
allingford
and
the
rest
and
be
a
nice
white
sheep
again
instead
of
a
giddy
old
black
one
i
can
tell
you
at
present
they
do
look
upon
you
as
being
a
particular
credit
to
the
sixth
i
do
care
what
they
think
they
a
beastly
set
of
prigs
and
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
them
with
allingford
especially
well
of
course
answered
fletcher
with
an
air
of
resignation
the
quarrel
yours
and
not
mine
i
must
own
that
i
think
allingford
made
a
great
deal
of
unnecessary
fuss
over
that
black
swan
business
and
acted
very
shabbily
in
making
you
send
in
your
resignation
just
before
the
holidays
there
something
too
that
i
ca
understand
about
the
doctor
not
confirming
your
and
i
think
there
ought
to
have
been
some
further
attempt
made
to
get
you
to
remain
in
the
team
you
did
a
lot
of
good
service
last
season
however
my
advice
is
put
your
pride
in
your
pocket
and
return
to
the
fold
young
carton
had
shown
that
he
possessed
a
certain
amount
of
insight
into
character
when
he
told
diggory
that
thurston
was
a
dangerous
fellow
to
cross
the
brow
darkened
as
fletcher
enumerated
this
list
of
real
or
imaginary
grievances
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
latter
speech
there
was
a
short
silence
yes
said
thurston
suddenly
making
the
fender
jump
and
rattle
with
a
vicious
kick
allingford
got
his
knife
in
me
he
bent
on
spoiling
my
life
here
but
that
a
game
two
can
play
at
i
got
a
plan
or
two
in
my
head
and
i
take
the
change
out
of
him
and
those
other
prigs
before
the
term
finished
grundy
still
continued
to
brag
and
swagger
in
the
lower
fourth
but
his
attitude
towards
jack
vance
suddenly
underwent
a
change
towards
the
latter
he
assumed
quite
a
friendly
bearing
and
though
still
remaining
a
stanch
thurstonian
refrained
from
making
himself
aggressively
obnoxious
to
the
triple
alliance
the
hatchet
had
been
buried
for
nearly
a
fortnight
when
an
event
happened
which
caused
ronleigh
college
to
be
once
more
convulsed
with
excitement
and
party
feeling
a
certain
air
of
mystery
which
pervaded
the
whole
affair
tending
to
considerably
increase
the
interest
which
the
occurrence
itself
awakened
allingford
had
not
perhaps
been
altogether
wise
in
his
choice
of
lucas
as
keeper
of
the
the
latter
was
a
studious
boy
in
the
fifth
whose
parents
were
known
to
be
in
comparatively
poor
circumstances
and
the
captain
had
named
him
in
preference
to
ferris
thinking
that
the
guinea
which
was
given
as
remuneration
to
the
holder
of
this
post
as
well
as
to
the
two
librarians
would
be
specially
acceptable
to
one
who
seldom
had
the
means
to
purchase
the
books
which
he
longed
to
possess
the
duties
of
the
keeper
of
the
were
to
receive
and
take
charge
of
the
papers
and
magazines
to
keep
the
accounts
and
to
be
nominally
responsible
for
the
order
of
the
room
i
say
nominally
as
the
law
relating
to
absolute
silence
was
never
actually
enforced
and
as
long
as
the
members
amused
themselves
in
a
reasonably
quiet
manner
and
without
turning
the
place
into
a
they
were
allowed
to
converse
over
their
games
of
chess
or
draughts
and
exchange
their
opinions
on
the
news
of
the
day
lucas
was
if
one
may
say
it
a
little
too
conscientious
in
the
execution
of
his
duties
and
rather
apt
to
be
fussy
and
a
trifle
overbearing
in
his
manner
he
posted
copies
of
the
rules
on
each
of
the
four
walls
of
the
room
and
insisted
on
decorous
behaviour
and
perfect
silence
the
consequence
was
that
he
soon
became
the
butt
of
innumerable
jokes
fellows
said
they
were
in
school
and
meant
to
enjoy
themselves
rats
hit
on
the
idea
of
carrying
in
an
old
newspaper
under
his
coat
this
he
surreptitiously
produced
and
pretended
to
read
as
though
it
belonged
to
the
room
at
a
favourable
moment
with
an
exclamation
of
well
this
is
a
rotten
paper
he
suddenly
crunched
the
sheet
up
in
his
hands
and
tore
it
into
fifty
pieces
lucas
naturally
imagining
that
the
property
of
the
room
was
being
destroyed
rushed
up
exploding
with
wrath
an
explanation
followed
and
the
whole
assembly
went
off
into
fits
of
merriment
at
the
latter
expense
by
the
time
this
trick
was
worn
out
other
waggish
gentlemen
had
introduced
the
practice
of
dropping
wax
matches
on
the
floor
and
treading
on
them
and
of
hunting
an
imaginary
moth
an
irresistibly
humorous
proceeding
in
which
the
participators
rushed
about
brandishing
books
and
magazines
ever
and
anon
crying
there
he
is
and
smiting
on
the
head
some
quiet
unoffending
reader
some
young
miscreant
went
so
far
as
to
put
bits
of
on
the
top
of
the
stove
the
consequence
being
that
in
a
short
time
a
mysterious
smell
arose
of
such
a
fearful
and
distressing
nature
that
every
one
was
obliged
to
bolt
out
into
the
passage
those
boys
who
at
the
time
of
the
elections
had
formed
the
rank
and
file
of
the
thurstonian
party
saw
here
an
opportunity
for
showing
their
resentment
of
what
they
still
chose
to
consider
unfair
conduct
on
allingford
part
as
a
result
so
they
said
of
the
favouritism
lucas
had
been
forced
into
a
position
for
which
he
was
entirely
and
with
the
expressed
determination
not
to
stand
him
at
any
price
they
proved
themselves
ever
ready
to
assist
in
keeping
up
a
constant
repetition
of
the
disturbances
which
have
just
been
described
these
games
it
need
hardly
be
said
were
not
carried
on
when
any
of
the
prefects
or
members
of
the
sixth
happened
to
be
present
but
during
the
between
the
end
of
tea
and
the
commencement
of
preparation
when
it
rarely
happened
that
any
of
the
seniors
put
in
an
appearance
the
conduct
of
the
place
went
steadily
from
bad
to
worse
lucas
lost
his
head
and
lost
his
temper
and
in
doing
so
lost
all
control
of
his
charge
and
at
last
things
were
brought
to
a
climax
in
the
manner
we
are
about
to
describe
at
the
back
of
the
room
was
one
of
those
short
desks
which
can
be
changed
at
will
into
a
seat
the
top
part
falling
over
and
making
a
while
the
form
remains
stationary
in
connection
with
this
article
of
furniture
gull
one
evening
introduced
a
new
pastime
which
he
called
putting
fellows
in
the
stocks
and
which
consisted
in
decoying
innocent
small
boys
into
taking
a
seat
then
suddenly
pushing
them
backwards
on
to
the
floor
and
imprisoning
their
feet
between
the
form
and
the
reversible
desk
a
position
from
which
they
only
extricated
themselves
with
considerable
difficulty
lucas
made
a
couple
of
attempts
to
interfere
and
stop
the
proceedings
and
when
at
length
for
the
third
time
a
thud
and
a
shout
of
laughter
announced
that
still
another
victim
had
fallen
into
the
trap
he
rose
in
wrath
and
ordered
gull
to
leave
the
room
i
sha
returned
the
other
keep
to
yourself
and
mind
your
own
business
that
just
what
i
doing
you
know
the
rules
as
well
as
i
do
my
business
to
keep
order
in
this
room
rubbish
who
do
you
think
cares
for
your
rules
you
will
you
leave
the
room
no
of
course
i
wo
if
you
want
to
act
you
better
try
it
on
in
desperation
lucas
resolved
to
play
his
last
card
look
here
gull
he
said
rising
from
his
seat
you
know
i
not
your
match
in
size
or
strength
or
you
would
challenge
me
to
fight
but
this
i
will
do
unless
you
leave
the
room
i
shall
go
at
once
and
report
you
to
dr
denson
the
offender
seeing
perhaps
that
this
was
no
empty
threat
evidently
considered
it
the
wiser
plan
not
to
risk
an
interview
with
the
oh
keep
your
wig
on
he
answered
with
a
scornful
laugh
i
should
like
to
make
you
prove
yourself
a
sneak
as
well
as
a
coward
i
going
in
a
minute
the
assembly
who
for
the
most
part
considered
the
stocks
joke
very
good
fun
and
were
possessed
with
all
the
traditional
schoolboy
hatred
for
anything
in
the
shape
of
telling
tales
showed
their
disapproval
with
a
good
deal
of
booing
and
hissing
as
gull
sauntered
out
of
the
room
and
lucas
bent
over
his
accounts
with
the
despairing
sense
of
having
lost
instead
of
gained
by
the
encounter
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
matter
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
drop
without
some
show
of
feeling
for
on
the
following
morning
the
unfortunate
official
was
greeted
with
jeers
and
uncomplimentary
remarks
wherever
he
went
just
before
tea
diggory
and
jack
vance
were
crossing
the
quadrangle
on
their
way
from
the
gymnasium
to
the
schoolroom
when
they
were
accosted
by
fletcher
junior
i
say
remarked
the
latter
in
rather
a
knowing
manner
if
you
want
to
see
a
lark
come
to
the
before
why
what
up
oh
never
mind
do
tell
any
one
i
told
you
and
the
speaker
passed
on
shall
we
go
said
diggory
we
might
as
well
answered
his
companion
laughing
i
wonder
what
the
joke
is
another
or
some
more
of
that
business
i
suppose
when
the
two
friends
entered
the
it
presented
an
unusually
quiet
and
orderly
appearance
about
twenty
boys
were
seated
at
the
various
desks
and
tables
all
occupied
with
games
of
chess
or
draughts
or
in
the
perusal
of
magazines
and
papers
even
grundy
who
never
read
anything
but
an
occasional
novel
was
poring
over
the
advertisement
columns
of
daily
with
apparently
great
interest
while
young
fletcher
was
equally
engrossed
in
the
broad
pages
of
an
attempt
to
put
rats
in
the
stocks
utterly
failed
from
the
fact
that
those
who
were
usually
foremost
in
acts
of
disorder
refused
to
render
any
assistance
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
nip
the
disturbance
in
the
bud
with
angry
ejaculations
of
here
dry
up
stop
it
you
i
say
murmured
diggory
after
sitting
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
listlessly
turning
over
the
pages
of
a
magazine
fletcher
sold
us
about
that
lark
i
do
see
the
use
of
staying
here
any
longer
hardly
had
the
words
been
uttered
when
some
one
in
the
passage
outside
crowed
like
a
cock
there
was
a
rustling
of
newspapers
and
the
next
instant
all
four
were
turned
out
simultaneously
and
the
room
was
plunged
in
total
darkness
what
followed
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
the
door
was
flung
open
there
was
an
inrush
of
boys
from
the
passage
and
the
place
became
a
perfect
pandemonium
tables
were
overturned
books
and
magazines
went
whizzing
about
in
the
darkness
a
grand
scrum
seemed
in
progress
round
lucas
desk
while
amid
the
chorus
of
whoops
whistles
and
the
latter
voice
was
distinctly
audible
crying
in
angry
tones
leave
me
alone
you
blackguards
let
go
i
say
jack
and
diggory
listened
in
amazement
to
the
uproar
with
which
they
suddenly
found
themselves
surrounded
and
not
wishing
to
risk
the
chance
of
having
a
form
or
a
table
upset
on
their
toes
remained
seated
in
their
corner
wondering
how
the
affair
would
end
at
length
piercing
the
general
uproar
came
the
distant
of
the
bell
for
preparation
the
tumult
suddenly
subsided
and
there
was
a
rush
for
the
passage
hardly
had
this
stampede
been
accomplished
when
some
one
struck
a
match
and
lit
the
nearest
the
door
it
was
gull
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
round
the
room
with
a
sardonic
smile
upon
his
face
evidently
very
well
pleased
with
the
sight
which
met
his
gaze
the
place
certainly
presented
the
appearance
of
a
town
which
had
been
bombarded
carried
by
storm
and
pillaged
for
a
week
by
some
foreign
foe
most
of
the
furniture
was
upset
or
pulled
out
of
place
magazines
and
papers
lay
strewn
about
in
every
direction
ink
was
trickling
in
black
rivulets
about
the
floor
and
draughts
and
chess
men
seemed
to
have
been
scattered
broadcast
all
over
the
place
in
addition
to
our
two
friends
three
other
boys
who
had
evidently
taken
no
active
part
in
the
proceedings
still
remained
at
some
seats
next
to
the
wall
while
lucas
with
hair
dishevelled
waistcoat
torn
open
and
collar
flying
loose
stood
flushed
and
panting
amid
the
of
his
overturned
desk
well
i
sure
said
gull
with
a
short
laugh
you
fellows
seem
to
have
been
having
rather
a
bit
of
fun
here
this
evening
i
thought
i
heard
a
row
and
i
was
coming
to
see
what
it
was
only
just
when
i
got
to
the
door
about
fifty
chaps
bounced
out
and
nearly
knocked
me
what
have
they
been
up
to
eh
lucas
never
you
mind
answered
the
unfortunate
official
choking
with
rage
the
bell
gone
so
all
of
you
clear
out
well
you
ca
blame
me
this
journey
retorted
gull
calmly
striking
another
match
and
lighting
the
next
it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
little
too
much
of
a
good
thing
you
have
to
lick
a
few
of
them
lucas
my
boy
and
if
you
ca
manage
it
yourself
you
better
get
some
one
else
to
do
it
for
you
your
friend
allingford
for
instance
the
master
on
duty
in
the
big
schoolroom
had
to
call
several
times
for
silence
before
the
subdued
hum
of
muttered
conversation
entirely
ceased
every
one
had
heard
of
the
riot
and
was
anxious
to
discuss
the
matter
with
his
companions
who
did
it
who
did
it
was
the
question
asked
on
all
sides
i
do
know
would
be
the
answer
they
say
it
was
the
fellows
who
were
in
the
room
some
of
them
put
the
gas
out
but
it
was
a
lot
of
other
chaps
who
rushed
in
after
who
did
all
the
damage
and
caused
such
it
seems
to
me
remarked
diggory
to
his
two
chums
that
it
was
a
job
all
arranged
beforehand
then
who
think
planned
it
asked
mugford
i
do
know
but
i
believe
gull
had
a
hand
in
it
oh
i
do
think
that
answered
jack
vance
he
came
in
and
lit
the
gas
if
he
been
in
it
he
have
skedaddled
with
the
rest
um
would
he
returned
diggory
nodding
his
head
in
a
sagacious
manner
i
rather
inclined
to
think
he
came
in
on
purpose
by
the
end
of
supper
a
fresh
rumour
spread
which
caused
the
affair
to
assume
a
still
graver
and
more
important
aspect
lucas
had
reported
the
whole
thing
to
the
and
the
latter
had
expressed
his
intention
of
inquiring
into
it
on
the
following
day
the
truth
of
these
tidings
was
proved
beyond
all
possibility
of
doubt
when
next
morning
at
breakfast
an
announcement
was
made
that
the
school
would
assemble
immediately
after
the
boys
left
the
hall
instead
of
gathering
as
usual
at
nine
every
one
knew
what
this
meant
the
subject
had
been
discussed
for
hours
in
most
of
the
dormitories
on
the
previous
evening
and
when
denson
ascended
his
throne
there
was
no
necessity
for
him
to
strike
the
small
the
usual
signal
for
silence
an
expectant
hush
pervaded
the
whole
of
the
big
room
showing
clearly
the
interest
which
every
one
felt
in
the
business
on
hand
i
need
hardly
say
began
the
doctor
in
his
clear
decisive
manner
that
my
object
in
calling
you
together
is
to
inquire
into
a
disgraceful
piece
of
disorder
which
took
place
in
the
last
night
i
am
astonished
that
such
outrageous
behaviour
should
be
possible
in
what
up
to
the
present
time
i
have
always
been
proud
to
regard
as
a
community
of
gentlemen
such
an
offence
against
law
and
order
can
not
be
allowed
to
pass
unpunished
i
feel
certain
that
the
greater
number
of
those
here
present
had
no
share
in
it
and
i
shall
give
the
culprits
a
chance
of
proving
themselves
at
all
events
sufficiently
honourable
to
prevent
their
schoolfellows
suffering
the
consequences
which
have
arisen
from
the
folly
of
individuals
let
those
boys
who
are
responsible
for
what
occurred
last
evening
stand
up
with
one
exception
nobody
stirred
a
solitary
small
boy
rose
to
his
feet
and
in
spite
of
the
gravity
of
the
situation
a
subdued
titter
ran
through
the
assembly
apparently
the
whole
of
the
row
and
disturbance
of
the
previous
evening
was
the
handiwork
of
one
single
boy
and
that
boy
the
youthful
rats
well
rathson
said
the
grimly
am
i
to
understand
that
you
overturned
forms
and
tables
scattered
books
and
papers
to
the
four
winds
and
nearly
tore
the
clothes
off
another
boy
back
n
no
sir
answered
rats
plaintively
then
will
you
explain
exactly
what
you
did
do
i
was
reading
and
the
gas
went
out
and
some
one
emptied
a
box
of
over
my
head
and
i
i
hit
him
and
then
there
was
a
lot
of
pushing
and
i
pushed
and
concluded
rats
apologetically
and
i
think
i
shouted
h
said
the
doctor
so
that
all
you
did
sit
down
lucas
yes
sir
do
you
remember
what
boys
were
in
the
last
night
yes
sir
but
i
do
think
they
were
responsible
for
what
happened
it
was
done
by
others
who
came
in
from
outside
there
was
a
silence
i
ask
once
more
said
the
what
boys
took
part
in
this
disturbance
let
them
stand
up
once
more
young
rats
alone
pleaded
guilty
very
well
then
continued
the
doctor
sternly
the
whole
school
will
be
punished
there
will
be
no
on
wednesday
afternoon
and
the
will
be
closed
for
a
sit
down
rathson
you
are
the
only
boy
among
the
many
who
must
have
been
connected
with
this
affair
the
only
one
i
say
who
has
any
sense
of
manliness
or
honour
write
me
a
hundred
lines
and
bring
them
to
me
morning
the
prospect
of
having
to
work
on
wednesday
afternoon
caused
the
boys
themselves
to
take
up
the
doctor
inquiry
and
the
query
who
did
it
became
the
burning
question
of
the
hour
the
riot
had
evidently
been
carefully
planned
beforehand
and
the
plot
arranged
in
such
a
manner
that
those
who
took
part
in
it
might
do
so
without
being
recognized
it
was
impossible
to
discover
who
really
were
the
culprits
though
the
majority
of
the
boys
put
it
down
as
having
been
done
by
some
of
lot
and
as
being
a
further
proof
of
the
animosity
towards
allingford
who
had
of
course
appointed
lucas
as
keeper
of
the
room
look
here
said
diggory
accosting
fletcher
two
in
the
playground
what
made
you
tell
us
to
come
to
the
last
night
how
did
you
know
there
was
going
to
be
a
row
i
did
murmured
the
other
warily
all
i
knew
was
that
they
were
going
to
put
in
the
i
had
the
faintest
idea
there
was
going
to
be
such
a
fine
old
rumpus
umph
had
you
muttered
diggory
turning
on
his
heel
i
know
better
chapter
xvi
the
cipher
letter
the
row
as
it
was
called
had
pretty
well
blown
over
when
one
morning
diggory
accosted
jack
vance
and
mugford
who
were
both
seated
at
the
latter
desk
sharpening
their
knives
on
an
i
say
you
fellows
look
what
i
found
as
he
spoke
he
laid
on
the
desk
a
slip
of
paper
it
was
evidently
a
scrap
torn
out
of
some
and
inscribed
upon
it
were
several
lines
of
capital
letters
all
jumbled
together
without
any
apparent
object
in
their
arrangement
and
to
be
more
exact
placed
as
follows

vgsvxfkylziwfmwvigsvhgzrih
well
what
is
there
funny
about
that
asked
jack
it
looks
to
me
as
if
some
one
had
been
practising
making
capitals
is
it
a
puzzle
inquired
mugford
no
but
i
tell
you
what
i
think
it
is
answered
diggory
sitting
down
and
speaking
in
a
low
mysterious
tone
it
a
letter
written
in
cipher
a
letter
repeated
mugford
glancing
at
the
paper
why
how
could
any
one
read
that
rubbish
nvvg
of
course
they
can
if
they
know
the
key
did
i
say
it
was
written
in
cipher
you
duffer
every
letter
you
see
there
stands
for
something
different
then
why
did
they
write
the
proper
letters
at
once
and
have
done
with
it
grumbled
mugford
because
you
prize
ass
retorted
diggory
with
pardonable
asperity
they
did
want
it
read
then
if
they
did
want
it
read
why
did
they
write
it
at
all
exclaimed
mugford
triumphantly
oh
shut
up
you
cracked
you
look
here
interrupted
jack
vance
where
did
you
find
the
thing
why
you
know
the
window
in
the
that
looks
out
on
the
well
there
a
little
crack
under
the
ledge
between
the
wooden
frame
and
the
wall
and
this
note
was
stuck
in
there
i
should
never
have
seen
it
only
i
was
watching
a
spider
crawling
up
the
wall
and
it
ran
into
the
hole
close
to
the
end
of
the
paper
some
fellows
must
be
using
the
place
as
a
sort
of
do
you
remember
fred
acton
made
one
in
the
wainscotting
at
the
birches
only
these
fellows
have
invented
a
cipher
well
i
going
to
find
it
out
and
read
this
note
just
for
the
lark
how
are
you
going
to
do
it
though
i
do
see
it
possible
to
read
a
thing
like
this
you
ca
tell
where
one
word
ends
and
a
fresh
one
begins
there
is
a
way
of
finding
out
a
cipher
answered
diggory
it
tells
you
how
to
do
it
in
that
book
that
we
bought
when
mug
had
his
things
sold
by
auction
at
chatford
what
in
poe
tales
asked
mugford
yes
in
one
of
the
stories
called
gold
bug
where
is
the
book
i
lent
it
to
maxton
but
i
should
think
he
finished
it
by
this
time
i
go
and
see
all
right
said
diggory
pocketing
the
slip
of
paper
you
get
it
and
then
i
can
show
you
what
i
mean
come
on
jack
let
go
out
the
two
friends
were
just
rising
from
the
form
on
which
they
had
been
sitting
when
they
were
accosted
by
browse
who
strolling
up
with
a
pair
of
dilapidated
slippers
on
his
feet
which
caused
him
to
walk
as
though
he
were
skating
inquired
in
drawling
tones
i
say
have
either
of
you
kids
got
a
jack
vance
handed
him
the
required
article
which
happened
to
be
of
the
kind
which
fit
all
watches
the
sixth
form
sap
was
very
and
proceeded
to
wind
up
his
timepiece
holding
it
close
to
his
spectacles
throughout
the
operation
i
ca
think
how
it
is
he
continued
in
his
tone
i
always
losing
my
key
i
had
two
new
ones
already
this
term
i
always
stick
them
in
a
place
where
i
think
they
sure
not
to
get
lost
and
then
i
forget
where
i
put
them
thanks
awfully
what
a
queer
old
codger
browse
is
remarked
diggory
as
the
big
fellow
moved
away
no
one
would
ever
think
he
was
so
clever
no
answered
jack
vance
did
you
hear
that
he
had
another
row
with
last
night
no
what
about
oh
the
same
thing
as
before
some
fellows
were
making
a
beastly
row
in
thurston
study
and
browse
could
work
so
he
threatened
if
they
were
quiet
he
report
them
to
the
doctor
came
out
in
an
awful
wax
and
said
for
two
pins
he
knock
browse
down
and
young
collis
who
was
standing
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
says
he
believes
have
done
it
if
some
of
the
other
fellows
in
the
sixth
had
come
out
and
interfered
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
diggory
secured
mugford
copy
of
tales
and
sad
to
relate
spent
a
good
part
of
that
preparation
in
trying
to
unravel
the
secret
of
the
mysterious
missive
which
he
had
found
in
the
so
intent
was
he
on
solving
the
problem
that
instead
of
going
down
to
supper
with
the
majority
of
his
companions
he
remained
seated
at
his
desk
poring
over
the
experiments
which
he
was
making
according
to
directions
given
in
the
famous
story
of
the
gold
bug
well
how
are
you
getting
on
inquired
jack
vance
as
the
crowd
came
straggling
back
from
the
oh
pretty
well
answered
the
other
the
first
thing
you
have
to
do
is
to
find
e
it
the
letter
which
occurs
most
frequently
well
in
this
case
v
is
the
letter
which
comes
oftenest
there
are
fourteen
of
them
so
v
is
then
when
you
know
what
e
is
you
search
for
the
word
there
are
certain
to
be
several
in
the
piece
so
you
look
for
instances
in
which
the
same
two
letters
come
before
e
or
in
this
case
before
well
here
it
is
g
s
v
five
times
so
you
are
pretty
certain
that
g
s
v
is
or
in
other
words
that
g
is
t
s
is
h
and
v
is
that
as
far
as
i
got
at
present
but
i
mean
to
worry
out
the
rest
of
it
while
diggory
was
holding
forth
in
the
big
schoolroom
on
his
methods
of
reading
a
cipher
a
conversation
of
a
very
different
character
and
on
a
matter
of
grave
importance
was
taking
place
in
the
study
of
the
school
captain
allingford
and
john
acton
were
seated
in
front
of
the
former
little
fireplace
talking
over
matters
connected
with
the
football
club
suddenly
there
was
a
sound
of
hurrying
feet
in
the
passage
the
next
instant
the
door
burst
open
and
in
bounced
browse
the
two
prefects
gazed
at
him
for
a
moment
in
astonishment
then
acton
broke
the
silence
exclaiming
why
browse
what
the
matter
the
sap
certainly
presented
an
extraordinary
appearance
his
spectacles
were
gone
his
hair
was
pasted
all
over
his
face
as
though
he
had
just
come
up
from
a
long
dive
his
clothes
were
torn
and
in
a
state
of
the
wildest
disorder
while
the
strangest
part
of
all
was
that
from
head
to
foot
he
seemed
soaking
wet
drenched
through
and
through
with
water
which
dripped
from
his
garments
as
he
stood
why
man
alive
cried
allingford
what
have
you
been
up
to
it
those
blackguards
gasped
browse
choking
with
rage
and
shaken
for
once
in
a
way
out
of
his
usual
drawl
it
that
thurston
and
his
crew
i
know
it
was
but
what
was
what
the
matter
with
some
little
difficulty
the
two
prefects
at
length
succeeded
in
extracting
from
their
excited
comrade
an
account
of
his
wrongs
even
then
such
an
amount
of
was
necessary
that
it
will
be
best
to
make
no
attempt
at
a
verbatim
report
but
rather
to
give
the
reader
a
more
concise
version
of
the
story
from
browse
statement
it
appeared
that
just
before
supper
some
one
had
come
to
his
study
saying
smeaton
wants
you
in
the
look
sharp
the
door
had
only
been
opened
about
a
couple
of
inches
and
then
closed
again
from
the
few
words
thus
spoken
browse
did
not
recognize
the
voice
but
thinking
that
his
particular
friend
smeaton
another
tremendous
worker
was
engaged
in
some
important
experiments
and
needed
his
assistance
he
hurried
away
never
dreaming
but
that
the
message
he
had
received
was
genuine
in
order
to
reach
the
laboratory
it
was
necessary
to
traverse
the
and
the
gymnasium
both
of
which
were
in
darkness
the
lights
being
turned
out
by
the
prefect
on
duty
when
the
boys
assembled
for
preparation
across
the
first
of
these
chambers
browse
groped
his
way
in
safety
hardly
however
had
he
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
second
when
he
was
suddenly
seized
and
held
fast
by
several
strong
pairs
of
hands
his
indignant
expostulations
were
met
with
a
titter
of
suppressed
laughter
he
was
roughly
forced
down
upon
his
knees
and
while
in
this
position
what
seemed
like
two
buckets
of
cold
water
were
emptied
over
his
devoted
head
this
having
been
done
he
was
dragged
to
his
feet
thrust
back
into
the
and
the
door
leading
into
the
gymnasium
was
slammed
to
and
locked
on
the
inside
from
first
to
last
not
a
word
had
been
spoken
and
at
the
very
commencement
of
the
struggle
spectacles
had
been
knocked
off
these
two
circumstances
had
entirely
prevented
him
from
recognizing
the
shadowy
figures
of
his
assailants
he
made
one
attempt
to
force
the
door
open
but
finding
it
securely
fastened
had
come
straight
away
to
the
captain
study
it
that
thurston
and
some
of
his
gang
he
repeated
in
conclusion
they
did
it
to
pay
me
out
for
interfering
with
their
noisy
meetings
allingford
and
john
acton
sprang
to
their
feet
the
idea
that
the
rowdy
element
should
be
so
powerful
in
ronleigh
that
a
sixth
form
boy
could
with
impunity
be
seized
and
drenched
with
cold
water
was
not
very
pleasing
to
one
who
was
largely
responsible
for
the
order
of
the
school
and
the
captain
face
was
as
black
as
thunder
all
right
he
exclaimed
leave
this
to
me
go
and
change
your
clothes
the
two
prefects
hurried
down
the
passage
wait
a
minute
said
allingford
which
is
thurston
study
acton
knocked
at
the
door
and
receiving
no
answer
pushed
it
open
and
looked
in
the
room
was
empty
come
on
cried
allingford
the
they
may
be
there
still
they
rushed
down
the
stairs
scattering
a
group
of
small
boys
who
were
roasting
chestnuts
at
the
in
the
passage
and
on
through
the
but
only
to
find
the
door
on
the
other
side
standing
wide
open
and
the
gymnasium
itself
silent
and
deserted
two
empty
lying
in
a
big
pool
of
wet
on
the
cement
floor
being
the
only
remaining
traces
of
the
recent
outrage
they
gone
said
acton
what
shall
we
do
we
find
one
of
them
at
all
events
replied
his
companion
and
returning
once
more
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
studies
he
shouted
there
was
a
faint
hullo
and
a
moment
later
a
door
opened
down
the
passage
well
what
want
allingford
walked
quickly
forward
look
here
he
demanded
sternly
where
have
you
been
what
have
you
been
doing
doing
echoed
thurston
why
i
been
sitting
here
for
the
last
two
hours
with
old
smeaton
i
asked
him
to
let
me
come
and
work
in
his
study
there
some
of
this
ovid
i
ca
get
on
with
and
he
promised
he
help
me
out
with
it
if
i
tell
him
what
it
was
i
understand
the
captain
hesitated
a
moment
rather
nonplussed
by
this
unexpected
reply
i
believe
you
know
something
about
this
affair
with
browse
he
continued
who
did
it
who
did
what
demanded
thurston
snappishly
if
you
mean
when
he
came
banging
at
my
study
door
last
night
no
i
do
mean
that
interrupted
allingford
i
mean
this
blackguard
trick
that
was
played
on
him
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
retorted
thurston
angrily
look
here
allingford
i
thank
you
not
to
call
me
a
blackguard
for
nothing
for
i
suppose
that
what
you
driving
at
if
you
think
i
speaking
the
truth
ask
smeaton
i
suppose
you
take
his
word
if
you
wo
take
mine
smeaton
whose
veracity
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
confirmed
the
last
speaker
assertions
and
allingford
and
acton
were
forced
to
beat
a
retreat
feeling
that
they
had
certainly
been
worsted
in
the
encounter
what
to
be
done
asked
acton
as
they
the
study
i
do
know
answered
the
other
flinging
himself
into
a
chair
the
only
thing
i
can
see
is
to
report
it
to
the
doctor
oh
i
should
do
that
it
more
a
piece
of
personal
spite
than
any
disorder
and
breach
of
rule
like
that
affair
i
think
it
a
thing
which
ought
to
be
put
down
by
the
fellows
themselves
who
was
in
thurston
study
last
night
i
do
know
it
may
have
been
those
fellows
gull
and
hawley
but
you
ca
accuse
them
without
some
evidence
you
see
what
i
got
just
now
for
tackling
thurston
ever
since
the
elections
there
seem
to
be
a
lot
of
fellows
bent
on
bringing
the
place
to
the
dogs
thurston
hand
and
glove
with
the
whole
lot
of
them
and
it
hard
to
say
who
did
this
thing
to
browse
a
report
of
what
had
happened
was
rapidly
spreading
all
over
the
school
one
by
one
the
other
prefects
dropped
in
to
the
captain
study
to
talk
the
matter
over
most
of
them
were
inclined
to
agree
with
acton
in
considering
it
a
thing
to
be
taken
up
by
the
boys
themselves
and
the
discussion
was
continued
till
bedtime
well
i
tell
you
what
i
think
i
better
do
said
allingford
preparing
to
wish
his
companions
i
report
it
to
the
doctor
and
ask
him
not
to
take
any
steps
in
the
matter
until
had
a
chance
of
inquiring
into
it
ourselves
the
story
of
browse
mishap
as
we
have
just
said
soon
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
until
it
was
common
property
throughout
the
college
the
remarks
which
the
news
elicited
were
often
of
an
entirely
opposite
nature
according
to
the
character
of
the
boys
who
made
them
noaks
and
mouler
laughed
aloud
declaring
it
a
rare
good
joke
but
to
the
credit
of
the
ronleians
of
that
generation
be
it
said
the
majority
shook
their
heads
and
muttered
beastly
shame
what
be
done
was
the
question
asked
on
all
sides
will
it
be
reported
to
the
doctor
if
it
is
said
rats
we
shall
lose
another
confound
those
fellows
whoever
they
are
i
should
like
to
see
them
all
jolly
well
kicked
on
the
following
day
the
first
assembly
for
morning
school
passed
without
anything
happening
though
every
one
looked
rather
anxiously
towards
the
throne
as
denson
took
his
seat
the
brazen
voice
of
the
bell
had
just
proclaimed
the
eleven
interval
when
the
triple
alliance
hurrying
with
their
companions
of
the
lower
fourth
along
the
main
corridor
leading
to
the
schoolroom
found
that
the
passage
was
nearly
blocked
by
a
large
crowd
of
boys
standing
round
the
hullo
said
diggory
another
rhyme
this
time
however
the
placard
was
in
good
plain
prose
and
ran
as
follows
notice
a
meeting
of
the
whole
school
will
take
place
directly
after
dinner
in
the
gymnasium
a
full
attendance
is
urgently
requested
as
the
matter
for
consideration
is
of
great
importance
r
allingford
humph
muttered
fletcher
senior
to
himself
as
he
turned
on
his
heel
after
reading
the
notice
the
fat
in
the
fire
now
and
no
mistake
chapter
xvii
diggory
reads
the
cipher
the
gymnasium
was
filled
with
a
dense
crowd
of
boys
rats
maxton
and
some
other
members
of
the
lower
fourth
were
fighting
for
seats
on
the
parallel
bars
and
throughout
tho
whole
assembly
there
was
a
subdued
murmur
of
interest
and
expectation
the
last
gathering
of
the
kind
had
been
a
held
some
two
years
previously
on
a
boy
suspected
of
stealing
old
stagers
in
a
patronizing
manner
related
what
had
happened
to
their
younger
comrades
adding
what
were
you
here
well
you
are
a
kid
and
forgetting
to
mention
that
at
the
time
they
themselves
were
wearing
knickerbockers
and
doing
simple
arithmetic
in
the
lowest
form
at
one
end
of
the
room
was
a
big
chest
containing
and
and
allingford
mounting
on
the
top
of
this
as
the
last
stragglers
from
the
joined
the
assembly
called
for
silence
there
was
no
attempt
at
eloquence
or
in
remarks
brief
they
were
almost
to
bluntness
but
well
suited
to
the
audience
to
whom
they
were
addressed
it
was
the
old
captain
of
ronleigh
who
spoke
and
the
boys
of
ronleigh
who
listened
and
the
manner
in
which
the
words
were
given
and
received
might
have
reminded
one
of
a
speech
of
sir
colin
campbell
in
the
indian
mutiny
and
the
answer
of
the
highlanders
he
addressed
you
are
my
own
lads
i
rely
on
you
to
do
yourselves
and
me
credit
ay
ay
sir
colin
ye
ken
us
and
we
ken
you
i
think
you
all
know
began
the
captain
the
reason
of
this
meeting
being
called
together
last
night
browse
was
set
on
in
this
room
in
the
dark
mind
you
knocked
down
and
drenched
with
cold
water
some
fellows
may
think
it
a
good
joke
i
do
i
think
the
fellows
who
did
it
were
cads
and
cowards
i
reported
the
matter
to
the
doctor
and
he
consented
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
the
prefects
and
leave
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
the
boys
themselves
rather
than
inquire
into
it
himself
which
would
probably
only
have
meant
another
punishment
for
the
whole
school
hear
hear
now
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
i
been
here
a
good
many
years
longer
than
any
one
except
oaks
and
rowlands
and
two
or
three
more
i
love
the
place
and
i
proud
of
it
i
sooner
be
captain
of
ronleigh
than
of
any
other
public
school
you
could
mention
cheers
but
i
tell
you
plainly
the
place
is
going
down
there
been
a
good
deal
too
much
of
this
rowdy
element
showing
lately
and
it
high
time
it
was
put
a
stop
to
some
of
you
i
know
have
lately
taken
a
dislike
to
me
and
think
i
do
act
rightly
no
no
if
i
to
blame
i
sorry
for
it
for
i
always
tried
to
do
my
best
i
ask
you
not
to
look
upon
this
matter
as
a
personal
affair
either
of
mine
or
of
any
of
the
other
prefects
but
to
consider
only
the
welfare
of
the
school
i
say
again
that
if
ronleigh
is
to
retain
its
reputation
and
be
kept
from
going
to
the
dogs
it
high
time
these
underhanded
bits
of
foul
play
like
the
row
and
this
attack
on
browse
were
put
a
stop
to
and
i
beg
you
all
to
join
in
taking
measures
to
prevent
anything
of
the
kind
occurring
again
in
the
future
the
speaker
concluded
his
remarks
amid
a
general
outburst
of
applause
so
we
will
cried
several
voices
three
cheers
for
old
ally
in
my
opinion
began
oaks
as
soon
as
order
was
restored
the
first
thing
is
to
try
to
find
out
who
did
it
surely
a
fellow
ca
be
set
on
by
three
or
four
others
without
somebody
knowing
something
about
have
you
yourself
any
idea
who
it
was
browse
well
i
ca
swear
answered
browse
readily
i
could
see
because
it
was
dark
and
my
spectacles
were
knocked
off
but
i
pretty
certain
it
was
some
of
thurston
lot
gull
or
hawley
or
some
of
those
fellows
they
did
it
because
i
complained
when
they
kicked
up
a
row
and
interfered
with
my
work
this
reply
created
a
great
sensation
and
the
air
was
rent
with
a
storm
of
groans
cheers
and
hisses
oaks
who
seemed
to
have
taken
upon
himself
the
duties
of
counsel
for
the
prosecution
held
up
his
hand
to
procure
silence
shut
up
he
exclaimed
every
one
will
be
heard
in
time
browse
thinks
it
might
have
been
gull
thurston
or
now
gull
what
have
you
got
to
say
where
were
you
last
night
in
bed
asleep
answered
gull
promptly
there
was
a
laugh
i
do
mean
that
what
we
want
to
know
is
what
were
you
doing
after
well
i
was
about
some
private
business
of
my
own
what
was
it
i
do
see
why
i
should
tell
you
all
my
private
affairs
well
in
this
instance
we
mean
to
know
so
out
with
it
what
were
you
doing
directly
after
last
night
there
was
a
hush
of
expectation
every
one
thought
an
important
disclosure
was
about
to
be
made
all
right
answered
gull
calmly
if
you
must
know
i
tell
you
i
was
in
the
matron
room
getting
her
to
sew
two
buttons
on
my
waistcoat
a
roar
of
laughter
interrupted
the
proceedings
the
defence
had
scored
heavily
oaks
was
for
the
moment
completely
nonplussed
and
thurston
seized
the
opportunity
of
making
a
he
strode
forward
and
mounting
the
chest
addressed
the
assembly
as
follows
gentlemen
however
low
ronleigh
may
have
sunk
there
is
still
i
believe
left
among
us
a
certain
amount
of
love
of
fair
play
and
therefore
i
ask
you
to
give
me
a
hearing
the
saying
goes
a
dog
a
bad
name
and
then
hang
him
i
a
dog
on
which
certain
people
have
been
good
enough
to
bestow
a
bad
name
i
know
i
got
it
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
much
care
all
the
same
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
hung
for
a
thing
which
is
no
fault
of
mine
you
just
heard
what
gull
had
to
say
i
can
prove
that
i
was
in
smeaton
study
when
this
thing
happened
and
i
daresay
if
hawley
is
to
be
be
able
to
show
that
he
was
somewhere
else
at
the
time
what
i
say
however
is
this
that
it
very
unfair
and
unjust
to
practically
accuse
fellows
of
a
thing
without
having
some
grounds
for
so
doing
i
do
want
to
brag
but
there
have
been
times
as
for
instance
at
the
last
wraxby
match
cheers
when
the
school
thought
well
of
me
loud
cheers
now
i
a
black
sheep
but
there
ought
to
be
fair
play
for
black
sheep
as
well
as
for
white
ones
hear
hear
allingford
said
something
about
underhanded
bits
of
foul
play
well
i
for
one
am
not
afraid
to
be
open
and
speak
my
mind
if
the
place
is
going
to
the
dogs
because
of
it
being
continually
in
a
state
of
disorder
then
the
fault
lies
with
the
prefects
sensation
they
the
ones
who
ought
to
check
it
and
if
they
are
incompetent
and
ca
do
their
duty
it
no
excuse
for
their
trying
to
shift
the
blame
on
to
fellows
who
are
innocent
but
who
happen
to
stand
in
their
bad
books
the
speech
had
just
the
effect
which
thurston
intended
it
should
have
the
english
schoolboy
has
always
been
a
zealous
champion
of
fair
play
though
sometimes
misled
in
his
ideas
as
to
what
the
term
really
implies
a
vague
sense
that
the
prefects
were
at
fault
and
that
this
inquiry
was
a
blind
to
cover
their
shortcomings
spread
through
the
meeting
oaks
was
interrupted
and
prevented
from
questioning
hawley
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
good
influence
of
allingford
opening
speech
would
be
entirely
lost
and
that
the
meeting
would
bring
about
a
still
more
hostile
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
rank
and
file
towards
those
in
authority
the
thurstonians
however
attempting
to
make
the
most
of
this
temporary
triumph
met
with
an
unexpected
disaster
which
quickly
turned
the
changing
tide
of
public
opinion
during
a
momentary
pause
in
the
hubbub
which
followed
address
fletcher
senior
with
the
usual
smile
upon
his
face
began
to
speak
thurston
has
just
said
that
as
regards
these
rows
the
fault
lies
with
the
prefects
and
that
they
are
culpable
in
trying
to
shift
the
blame
on
to
other
fellows
without
first
getting
sufficient
evidence
to
warrant
their
so
doing
as
one
of
the
prefects
i
think
it
only
fair
to
myself
to
mention
that
i
was
not
in
favour
of
this
meeting
being
called
i
suggested
to
my
friend
allingford
that
this
matter
should
be
allowed
to
rest
until
some
inquiries
had
been
made
stop
cried
the
captain
sternly
the
two
lines
were
deepening
between
his
eyebrows
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
were
drawn
down
the
boys
had
seen
that
look
before
as
he
stood
at
the
wicket
when
runs
were
few
and
the
bowling
dangerous
stop
speak
the
truth
you
not
my
friend
allingford
says
we
are
not
friends
continued
the
speaker
with
the
same
eternal
smile
upon
his
lips
i
sorry
to
hear
it
i
know
always
tried
to
be
his
friend
ever
you
lying
interrupted
the
other
sharply
take
care
or
prove
it
there
was
a
dead
silence
all
over
the
room
fletcher
did
not
know
what
was
coming
and
though
he
felt
uneasy
he
had
gone
too
far
to
go
back
i
ca
understand
he
began
why
you
should
have
this
unkind
feeling
towards
me
i
can
only
repeat
in
spite
of
what
you
say
that
i
your
friend
very
well
returned
the
other
with
an
angry
flash
in
his
eyes
as
it
was
partly
an
attack
on
myself
i
had
meant
to
have
said
nothing
about
it
but
since
you
persist
in
your
miserable
hypocrisy
i
expose
you
remember
he
continued
turning
to
the
audience
and
speaking
with
a
ring
of
bitter
scorn
in
his
voice
that
paltry
rhyme
that
was
fastened
on
the
after
the
town
match
well
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
the
author
of
it
he
was
too
modest
to
sign
his
name
to
it
but
here
he
is
all
the
same
a
fellow
who
tries
to
bring
ridicule
and
contempt
on
his
own
side
who
stabs
a
man
in
the
dark
and
in
the
daylight
professes
to
be
his
friend
a
derisive
groan
rose
from
the
crowd
you
ca
prove
it
retorted
fletcher
turning
first
white
and
then
red
i
can
prove
it
up
to
the
hilt
you
had
the
confounded
cheek
to
borrow
from
me
the
very
book
of
songs
you
used
when
you
wrote
the
parody
and
you
were
fool
enough
to
leave
the
rough
copy
in
it
when
you
brought
it
back
it
there
now
in
your
writing
shall
i
send
for
it
it
on
my
study
table
at
this
moment
the
culprit
muttered
something
about
it
being
only
a
joke
but
his
reply
was
lost
amid
a
storm
of
hoots
and
hisses
sneak
cried
one
voice
turn
him
out
yelled
another
while
the
object
of
this
outburst
of
animosity
recovering
himself
sufficiently
to
glance
round
with
a
contemptuous
sneer
on
his
face
fell
back
and
endeavoured
to
hide
his
confusion
by
entering
into
conversation
with
gull
and
thurston
fletcher
had
come
a
nasty
cropper
and
reaped
what
sooner
or
later
is
the
inevitable
reward
of
once
more
the
sympathy
of
the
meeting
was
enlisted
on
the
side
of
allingford
and
the
prefects
and
the
crowd
dispersed
resolved
to
discover
if
possible
who
had
made
the
attack
on
browse
and
determined
that
such
acts
of
disorder
were
not
to
be
tolerated
in
the
future
hullo
old
chap
said
thurston
entering
his
friend
study
a
few
moments
later
you
made
rather
a
mess
of
that
speech
of
yours
i
inclined
to
think
you
damaged
your
reputation
i
do
care
returned
the
other
we
both
leaving
at
the
end
of
this
term
as
for
allingford
just
let
him
look
out
it
be
my
turn
to
move
next
and
there
plenty
of
time
to
finish
the
game
between
now
and
christmas
it
was
a
bright
crisp
afternoon
almost
everybody
hurried
away
to
change
for
football
where
diggy
asked
jack
vance
as
he
and
mugford
strolled
out
to
the
junior
playing
field
oh
he
said
he
was
coming
he
stewing
away
at
that
stupid
cipher
he
ca
find
any
word
except
he
never
be
able
to
read
the
thing
it
being
a
the
games
lasted
a
little
longer
than
usual
at
length
however
the
signal
was
given
to
cease
fire
and
a
general
cry
of
hold
the
ball
put
an
end
to
the
several
contests
the
crowd
of
players
were
tramping
across
the
paved
playground
and
surging
through
the
archway
into
the
quadrangle
when
jack
vance
and
mugford
were
suddenly
confronted
by
diggory
he
held
some
scraps
of
paper
in
his
hand
and
appeared
to
be
greatly
agitated
come
here
he
cried
seizing
each
of
them
by
the
arm
i
got
something
to
show
you
well
what
is
it
asked
the
other
two
their
friend
however
would
vouchsafe
no
further
reply
than
come
here
out
of
the
way
and
tell
you
he
dragged
them
along
until
they
reached
the
deserted
entrance
to
some
of
the
classrooms
then
stopping
and
turning
to
them
with
an
extraordinary
look
of
mingled
triumph
mystery
and
excitement
exclaimed
i
read
the
cipher
pooh
what
of
that
answered
jack
rather
annoyed
at
being
taken
so
far
out
of
his
way
for
nothing
i
expect
it
is
anything
particular
after
all
it
is
though
returned
the
other
confidently
and
you
say
so
too
when
you
read
it
well
tell
us
first
how
you
managed
to
find
it
out
that
just
what
i
was
going
to
do
you
know
i
found
that
g
was
t
s
was
h
and
v
was
e
well
i
tried
and
tried
and
i
could
get
any
further
i
wrote
down
the
alphabet
and
put
v
opposite
e
and
t
opposite
g
and
s
opposite
i
stared
at
it
and
stared
at
it
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
do
know
how
i
came
to
think
of
it
i
noticed
that
e
is
the
fifth
letter
from
the
of
the
alphabet
and
v
is
the
fifth
letter
from
the
the
same
thing
held
good
with
the
next
letter
g
was
seventh
from
the
beginning
and
t
was
seventh
from
the
end
diggory
paused
as
though
to
see
what
effect
this
announcement
would
have
on
the
faces
of
his
friends
well
they
exclaimed
go
on
why
then
i
saw
in
a
moment
what
they
done
simply
transposed
the
whole
was
z
and
z
was
a
oh
cried
jack
vance
i
see
it
now
of
course
it
was
as
plain
as
print
i
put
the
two
alphabets
side
by
side
one
the
right
way
and
the
other
upside
down
and
i
read
the
cipher
in
two
minutes
and
here
what
you
might
call
the
translation
as
he
spoke
he
held
out
a
scrap
of
jack
vance
took
it
and
read
as
follows
meet
in
the
when
the
fellows
pass
on
to
supper
the
two
cans
of
water
are
standing
inside
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
mugford
stared
at
jack
vance
and
jack
stared
at
diggory
see
cried
the
latter
eagerly
yes
well
what
then
why
it
must
have
something
to
do
with
this
row
about
browse
of
course
the
fellows
who
did
it
did
want
i
suppose
to
be
seen
talking
together
too
much
just
before
it
happened
and
so
they
invented
this
way
of
making
their
plans
but
who
can
it
be
asked
mugford
it
seems
to
me
it
just
like
one
of
those
secret
society
things
in
russia
so
it
is
and
we
must
find
out
who
they
are
answered
diggory
smacking
his
lips
with
great
relish
we
see
once
more
what
can
be
done
by
the
triple
alliance
the
more
the
three
friends
thought
over
the
matter
of
the
cipher
letter
the
more
their
curiosity
and
interest
were
excited
i
believe
it
either
noaks
or
mouler
said
mugford
they
were
both
of
them
siding
with
thurston
and
trying
to
kick
up
a
row
at
the
meeting
oh
they
neither
of
them
have
the
sense
to
invent
a
thing
like
this
answered
jack
they
may
be
in
it
but
there
some
one
else
besides
diggory
scouted
the
idea
of
letting
any
other
boys
share
their
secret
the
honour
of
having
discovered
and
exposed
the
plot
must
belong
to
the
triple
alliance
alone
and
it
must
be
said
that
they
had
accomplished
their
task
unaided
by
any
outsiders
that
evening
and
the
following
day
the
greater
portion
of
their
free
time
was
spent
in
discussing
the
great
question
as
to
what
should
be
done
the
cipher
note
evidently
had
direct
connection
with
the
attack
on
browse
but
the
translation
of
the
letter
was
in
itself
like
finding
a
key
without
knowing
the
whereabouts
of
the
lock
which
it
fitted
the
question
was
by
whom
and
for
whom
it
had
been
written
afternoon
school
was
just
over
and
the
three
friends
were
standing
warming
their
feet
on
a
pipe
discussing
the
likelihood
of
making
any
other
discoveries
which
might
tend
to
throw
more
light
on
the
subject
when
suddenly
a
happy
thought
entered
the
head
of
jack
vance
look
here
diggory
you
said
you
found
this
note
in
a
crack
in
the
wall
under
one
of
the
windows
and
that
you
thought
some
fellows
were
using
it
as
a
sort
of
well
have
you
been
there
to
see
if
anything
been
put
there
since
no
cried
diggory
good
idea
i
go
now
at
once
he
walked
quickly
out
of
the
room
and
came
back
a
few
moments
later
at
a
run
i
got
one
he
exclaimed
in
a
low
eager
tone
do
let
any
one
see
come
to
my
desk
the
note
this
time
was
very
brief
zugvigvzfmwvigsvkze
diggory
hastily
fished
out
his
double
alphabet
wrote
down
the
proper
letters
as
jack
read
out
those
on
the
paper
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
translation
was
complete
and
read
as
follows
tea
under
the
the
three
boys
stared
at
it
in
silence
what
does
it
mean
asked
mugford
why
cried
diggory
excitedly
i
see
something
going
to
happen
after
tea
this
evening
in
that
place
under
the
pavilion
you
know
where
i
mean
the
other
two
nodded
their
heads
the
pavilion
at
ronleigh
being
raised
some
distance
above
the
level
of
the
field
there
was
a
space
between
the
floor
and
the
ground
used
for
storing
and
a
number
of
forms
which
were
brought
out
on
to
afford
seats
for
visitors
the
door
of
this
den
had
no
lock
and
opened
on
the
piece
of
waste
turf
at
the
back
of
the
building
small
boys
used
it
as
a
cave
when
playing
brigands
and
for
so
doing
had
their
ears
boxed
by
irate
members
of
the
sports
committee
it
was
too
low
to
admit
of
any
one
moving
about
except
in
a
stooping
posture
and
pitch
dark
unless
the
door
was
left
wide
open
what
do
you
think
it
is
said
mugford
i
do
know
answered
diggory
but
i
mean
to
go
and
see
if
they
catch
you
prying
about
and
find
out
that
you
been
watching
them
you
get
an
awful
licking
i
do
care
if
i
do
i
mean
to
go
well
we
go
with
you
said
jack
vance
remember
it
the
triple
alliance
and
we
vowed
always
to
stand
by
each
other
whatever
happened
yes
answered
diggory
and
so
we
will
but
there
less
chance
of
one
being
seen
than
three
no
i
go
alone
chapter
xviii
a
secret
society
it
was
a
clear
starlight
night
diggory
was
one
of
the
first
to
leave
the
and
passing
swiftly
out
of
the
quadrangle
was
soon
hurrying
across
the
junior
playing
field
on
reaching
the
pavilion
all
was
quiet
and
deserted
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
considering
what
should
be
his
next
step
the
thin
hedge
dividing
the
two
playgrounds
was
by
this
time
bare
of
leaves
and
afforded
no
the
only
chance
of
concealment
was
to
take
shelter
inside
the
den
itself
a
place
which
has
already
been
described
this
however
seemed
rather
like
venturing
into
the
mouth
what
was
going
to
happen
would
anything
take
place
or
was
it
only
a
chase
after
all
here
goes
muttered
diggory
to
himself
he
opened
the
door
pulling
it
to
again
after
him
as
he
crept
inside
then
taking
a
step
forward
in
the
pitchy
darkness
promptly
fell
over
a
bucket
with
an
appalling
crash
scrambling
once
more
to
his
feet
he
felt
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
finding
there
a
fusee
which
he
remembered
to
have
taken
from
a
box
owned
by
rats
he
struck
it
and
by
the
aid
of
its
feeble
glare
crept
behind
the
heap
of
benches
which
lay
piled
up
close
to
the
opposite
wall
hardly
had
he
done
so
when
there
were
a
sound
of
footsteps
and
a
murmur
of
conversation
the
door
was
opened
and
some
one
crept
into
the
den
no
sooner
had
the
crossed
the
threshold
than
he
stopped
sniffed
audibly
and
exclaimed
hullo
what
a
stink
of
fusees
who
been
here
i
wonder
diggory
instantly
recognized
the
voice
as
belonging
to
noaks
and
the
sound
of
it
brought
a
momentary
recollection
of
the
time
when
he
and
jack
vance
had
lain
concealed
behind
the
hedge
opposite
to
horace
house
his
heart
beat
fast
and
he
vainly
wished
that
he
had
had
sufficient
forethought
to
come
provided
with
some
ordinary
matches
several
more
boys
entered
and
one
of
them
struck
a
light
diggory
peering
through
an
aperture
in
the
pile
of
forms
saw
at
a
glance
who
they
were
fletcher
senior
thurston
noaks
and
hawley
there
do
seem
to
be
any
one
about
continued
noaks
peering
into
the
corners
yet
it
rum
there
should
be
such
a
smell
of
fusees
i
expect
it
was
the
man
said
thurston
producing
a
and
sticking
it
in
an
empty
bottle
which
lay
on
the
ground
he
was
in
here
this
afternoon
after
some
of
those
old
boxes
and
i
expect
he
lit
his
pipe
the
smell
is
sure
to
hang
about
when
the
shut
the
four
boys
sat
down
on
two
upturned
buckets
and
a
couple
of
old
hampers
with
the
candle
in
their
midst
and
diggory
gave
vent
to
an
inward
sigh
of
relief
well
began
thurston
one
reason
we
meet
here
is
because
i
wanted
to
explain
to
you
fellows
that
we
ca
have
any
more
of
those
pleasant
little
parties
in
my
study
at
all
events
for
the
present
until
this
row
about
browse
has
blown
over
every
one
be
watching
us
like
cats
watching
a
mouse
we
ought
not
to
be
seen
speaking
together
and
that
where
that
cipher
business
that
old
fletcher
invented
will
come
in
jolly
useful
we
can
say
anything
we
want
to
without
appearing
to
meet
interrupted
noaks
what
became
of
that
last
note
mouler
told
me
about
it
or
i
should
have
come
some
one
had
taken
it
away
before
i
went
to
look
perhaps
it
was
gull
answered
thurston
where
is
he
he
got
some
turned
work
to
do
answered
hawley
mouler
outside
keeping
added
noaks
we
thought
it
would
be
well
for
some
one
to
keep
a
in
case
anybody
came
well
what
i
was
going
to
say
continued
thurston
is
that
for
the
present
we
better
lie
low
and
not
be
seen
going
about
together
it
was
a
good
thing
gull
and
i
managed
to
turn
the
tables
on
oaks
at
that
inquiry
it
would
have
been
jolly
awkward
for
the
rest
of
you
to
have
proved
an
of
course
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
keep
out
of
it
as
it
was
a
dead
certainty
they
pounce
down
on
me
first
so
i
went
and
sat
all
the
evening
with
old
smeaton
ha
ha
the
fool
quite
thought
i
meant
it
when
i
asked
him
to
help
me
about
my
work
but
i
say
how
did
it
come
off
i
have
heard
the
particulars
oh
simply
enough
answered
hawley
noaks
and
mouler
and
gull
and
i
did
the
trick
young
grundy
was
the
voice
that
told
browse
to
go
down
to
the
grundy
hung
about
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
browse
come
back
and
make
for
allingford
study
he
let
us
know
the
coast
was
clear
so
we
unlocked
the
door
and
skedaddled
gull
went
straight
away
to
the
matron
room
and
asked
her
to
sew
the
two
buttons
on
his
waistcoat
he
pulled
them
off
on
purpose
he
is
a
cunning
beggar
that
gull
fancy
his
staying
behind
to
light
the
gas
and
telling
lucas
he
only
just
come
why
he
did
more
of
the
wrecking
than
any
two
of
us
put
together
think
young
grundy
to
be
trusted
asked
noaks
oh
yes
answered
hawley
he
been
on
our
side
all
along
he
had
a
fight
with
young
not
long
ago
about
that
skit
on
the
town
match
besides
i
told
him
that
if
it
gets
out
that
he
had
a
hand
in
that
browse
business
he
be
expelled
so
he
keep
his
mouth
shut
right
enough
oh
cried
thurston
turning
to
his
particular
chum
have
you
heard
anything
more
about
that
poem
of
yours
fletcher
senior
who
had
been
sitting
all
this
time
scowling
in
silence
at
the
candle
answered
shortly
no
hullo
returned
his
friend
what
the
matter
you
seem
precious
glum
what
up
are
you
going
to
chuck
this
business
and
turn
good
you
asked
me
whether
i
heard
anything
more
about
that
rhyme
i
wrote
answered
the
other
rousing
himself
and
speaking
with
a
thrill
of
anger
in
his
voice
i
say
no
but
i
a
jolly
lot
how
mean
why
there
not
a
fellow
in
the
sixth
but
gives
me
the
cold
shoulder
allingford
sets
the
example
and
there
hardly
one
of
them
will
give
me
a
civil
word
they
like
to
oust
me
from
the
prefects
like
they
did
you
but
they
sha
and
what
more
i
get
even
chalks
with
some
of
them
before
i
leave
hear
hear
exclaimed
thurston
that
just
what
i
say
and
now
the
question
is
what
shall
we
do
nothing
at
present
answered
the
other
we
must
wait
until
this
affair
blown
over
there
no
need
to
run
the
risk
of
getting
expelled
and
besides
we
want
some
time
to
think
of
a
plan
the
faint
of
a
bell
sounded
across
the
playing
field
noaks
and
hawley
rose
to
their
feet
exclaimed
the
latter
we
must
be
off
a
new
cause
for
anxiety
now
presented
itself
to
diggory
mind
in
the
thought
that
he
would
be
late
in
taking
his
place
in
the
big
schoolroom
he
knew
that
noaks
and
hawley
would
have
to
be
in
time
for
the
assembly
but
the
two
sixth
form
boys
were
not
amenable
to
the
same
rule
and
might
linger
behind
thurston
however
rose
to
his
feet
blew
out
the
candle
and
the
four
conspirators
groped
their
way
in
a
body
out
through
the
low
doorway
diggory
waited
until
he
thought
they
must
have
reached
the
school
buildings
and
then
prepared
to
follow
the
bell
had
stopped
ringing
some
minutes
and
without
looking
very
carefully
where
he
was
going
he
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
out
of
the
and
across
the
junior
field
suddenly
right
in
front
of
him
and
within
fifty
yards
of
the
paved
playground
a
dark
figure
seemed
all
at
once
to
rise
out
of
the
ground
it
was
noaks
the
latter
had
dropped
a
and
had
been
left
by
his
companions
searching
for
it
on
his
hands
and
knees
hullo
he
exclaimed
catching
the
small
boy
by
the
arm
who
are
you
and
where
have
you
been
what
that
to
you
answered
diggory
boldly
let
me
go
the
remembrance
of
that
mysterious
smell
of
a
fusee
flashed
across
noaks
mind
look
here
he
cried
sharply
you
tell
me
this
moment
where
been
in
the
other
field
what
were
you
doing
there
running
there
was
a
moment
silence
noaks
had
a
strong
suspicion
that
the
other
knew
something
about
the
secret
meeting
it
was
equally
possible
however
that
he
did
not
young
madcaps
were
often
known
to
let
off
steam
by
careering
wildly
round
the
field
after
dark
and
if
this
had
really
been
the
case
in
the
present
instance
it
would
be
folly
to
say
anything
that
should
awaken
suspicion
the
big
fellow
hesitated
then
a
happy
thought
occurred
to
him
he
dragged
his
captive
across
the
paved
playground
and
stopping
under
the
which
lit
up
the
archway
leading
into
the
quadrangle
began
a
hasty
examination
of
the
contents
of
the
latter
pockets
there
was
no
time
to
lose
and
failing
to
find
what
he
sought
noaks
gave
the
youngster
a
final
shake
saying
as
he
did
so
look
here
have
you
forgotten
that
coin
robbery
because
if
you
have
i
have
i
got
that
knife
still
do
you
fall
foul
of
me
or
you
have
reason
to
be
sorry
for
it
hear
the
two
boys
ran
quickly
across
to
the
big
schoolroom
and
entered
just
in
time
to
take
their
seats
before
the
master
on
duty
called
silence
as
might
have
been
expected
none
of
the
triple
alliance
put
in
an
appearance
at
supper
that
evening
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
congregated
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
listening
to
a
graphic
account
of
diggory
adventures
noaks
threat
about
the
revived
all
their
former
feelings
of
dread
and
uneasiness
respecting
their
unfortunate
expedition
to
the
hermitage
and
there
was
a
grave
look
upon
their
faces
as
the
narrative
concluded
you
see
said
diggory
as
he
brought
his
story
to
a
close
the
thing
was
this
he
was
quite
sure
whether
i
knew
anything
or
not
but
he
said
that
to
frighten
me
in
case
i
did
i
do
see
that
we
can
do
anything
began
mugford
uneasily
you
say
they
are
going
to
kick
up
any
other
row
just
yet
and
it
would
be
an
awful
thing
if
noaks
found
it
out
and
sent
my
knife
to
the
police
no
i
do
see
very
well
what
i
can
do
answered
diggory
somehow
it
seems
rather
mean
to
hide
away
and
then
go
and
tell
what
overheard
i
think
it
best
to
leave
it
and
keep
a
sharp
and
see
what
happens
next
fancy
fletcher
inventing
that
cipher
said
jack
vance
and
being
mixed
up
with
that
lot
he
is
a
beast
it
was
just
like
him
making
that
underhanded
attack
on
the
football
team
yes
added
mugford
and
fancy
gull
being
in
both
those
rows
and
making
every
one
believe
he
was
they
must
be
a
deep
lot
so
they
are
answered
diggory
complacently
but
they
are
a
match
for
the
triple
alliance
i
say
what
made
noaks
search
your
pockets
asked
jack
as
the
three
friends
prepared
to
break
up
their
confab
oh
for
a
long
time
i
could
imagine
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
thought
why
it
was
do
you
see
he
wanted
to
find
if
i
had
any
more
fusees
my
stars
i
was
glad
had
only
given
me
one
instead
of
the
box
chapter
xix
a
chapter
of
accidents
the
firmest
friendships
we
are
told
have
been
formed
in
mutual
adversity
and
among
the
many
trials
which
served
to
strengthen
and
confirm
the
loyalty
and
unity
of
the
triple
alliance
a
string
of
minor
disasters
which
overtook
them
one
unlucky
day
early
in
december
must
certainly
not
be
overlooked
the
after
results
of
this
chapter
of
accidents
cause
it
to
assume
an
additional
importance
as
being
the
beginning
of
the
end
alike
of
this
narrative
and
of
an
eventful
period
in
the
history
of
ronleigh
college
the
reader
will
understand
therefore
that
in
turning
our
attention
for
a
short
time
to
an
account
of
the
misfortune
of
the
three
friends
we
are
not
wandering
from
what
might
be
called
the
main
line
of
our
story
it
all
came
about
so
said
jack
vance
through
carton
having
the
cheek
to
go
home
some
ten
days
before
proper
time
the
latter
certainly
did
for
one
reason
or
another
leave
ronleigh
on
wednesday
the
eleventh
of
december
and
by
his
own
special
request
our
three
friends
came
down
to
the
station
to
see
him
off
have
you
got
anything
to
read
going
along
asked
diggory
as
they
stood
lingering
round
the
carriage
door
yes
answered
carton
look
here
you
fellows
you
might
get
in
and
sit
round
the
window
till
the
train
starts
it
keep
other
people
from
getting
in
and
i
shall
have
the
place
to
myself
the
triple
alliance
did
as
they
were
requested
aha
my
boys
continued
carton
rubbing
his
hands
together
when
you
stewing
away
in
this
evening
think
of
me
at
home
eating
a
rattling
good
tea
and
no
more
work
to
prepare
after
it
for
old
greyling
oh
rubbish
cried
jack
i
would
go
now
even
if
i
had
the
chance
why
you
miss
all
the
fun
of
breaking
up
and
young
is
making
up
a
party
to
fill
a
carriage
and
we
going
to
have
a
fine
spree
then
by
the
time
we
get
home
for
christmas
it
be
all
stale
to
you
pshaw
i
would
hullo
here
stop
a
minute
why
she
off
off
she
certainly
was
there
had
been
a
sharp
chirrup
of
the
whistle
and
at
almost
the
same
moment
the
train
began
to
move
diggory
tried
to
let
down
the
window
to
get
at
the
handle
of
the
door
but
the
sash
worked
stiffly
and
before
he
succeeded
in
making
it
drop
the
train
had
run
the
length
of
the
platform
and
the
station
was
left
behind
the
four
boys
gazed
at
one
another
for
a
moment
in
blank
astonishment
and
then
burst
into
a
simultaneous
roar
of
laughter
you
have
to
go
as
far
as
chatton
now
said
carton
never
mind
you
can
get
back
by
the
next
train
yes
but
the
question
is
if
we
got
any
money
answered
jack
vance
ruefully
it
fourpence
the
single
journey
so
the
fare
there
and
back
for
three
of
us
be
two
bob
here
threepence
that
all
the
tin
i
what
have
you
got
diggy
four
halfpenny
stamps
and
half
a
frank
on
my
was
the
reply
but
i
do
think
these
railway
johnnies
take
either
of
those
on
examination
the
only
articles
of
value
mugford
pockets
were
found
to
contain
were
an
aluminium
which
would
work
and
a
dirty
scrap
of
indiarubber
look
here
cried
carton
i
give
you
two
shillings
it
my
fault
and
i
got
something
over
from
my
the
offer
was
gladly
accepted
and
at
length
when
the
train
reached
chatton
the
three
chums
wished
their
companion
laughing
heartily
over
their
unexpected
journey
what
time
the
next
train
back
to
ronleigh
asked
jack
as
he
paid
the
money
for
their
fare
to
the
let
see
answered
the
official
next
train
to
ronleigh
jack
face
fell
is
there
any
train
before
that
he
asked
we
got
to
be
back
at
the
school
by
five
ca
help
that
returned
the
man
next
train
from
here
to
and
he
added
encouragingly
she
nearly
always
a
bit
late
the
boys
wandered
disconsolately
through
the
of
the
little
country
station
and
halted
outside
to
consider
what
was
to
be
done
it
past
four
said
jack
vance
looking
at
his
watch
and
it
a
good
six
miles
by
road
we
shall
never
walk
it
in
the
time
it
a
good
bit
shorter
by
rail
mused
diggory
if
we
could
walk
along
the
line
that
tunnel
under
arrow
hill
cuts
off
a
long
round
we
could
do
that
said
mugford
there
are
all
over
the
shop
saying
that
trespassers
on
the
railway
will
be
prosecuted
oh
bother
that
cried
jack
vance
suddenly
smitten
with
idea
who
cares
for
we
go
home
along
the
line
if
we
trot
every
now
and
then
we
shall
get
back
in
time
well
we
better
walk
along
the
road
as
far
as
that
curve
said
diggory
and
then
they
wo
see
us
from
the
station
the
trio
started
off
in
the
direction
indicated
hurrying
along
the
permanent
way
hopping
over
the
sleepers
and
seeing
how
far
they
could
run
on
one
of
the
metals
without
falling
off
at
length
they
entered
a
cutting
the
steep
banks
of
which
rose
gradually
until
they
towered
high
above
their
heads
on
either
hand
before
long
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
was
reached
and
as
if
by
mutual
consent
the
three
friends
came
to
a
halt
there
was
something
forbidding
about
the
dark
gloomy
entrance
the
stale
smoky
smell
and
the
damp
dripping
from
the
roof
all
tending
to
give
it
a
very
uninviting
aspect
it
awfully
long
said
mugford
do
you
think
we
better
turn
back
in
their
secret
hearts
his
two
companions
were
more
than
half
inclined
to
follow
this
suggestion
but
there
is
a
form
of
cowardice
to
which
even
the
bravest
are
subject
namely
the
fear
of
being
thought
afraid
and
it
was
this
perhaps
which
decided
them
to
advance
instead
of
retreat
oh
no
we
wo
go
back
cried
diggory
come
along
i
go
first
and
so
saying
he
plunged
forward
into
the
deep
shadow
of
the
archway
the
ground
seemed
to
be
plentifully
strewn
with
ashes
which
scrunched
under
their
feet
as
they
plodded
along
and
their
voices
sounded
hollow
and
strange
my
eye
said
jack
it
precious
dark
i
can
hardly
see
where
going
it
be
darker
still
before
we
see
the
end
answered
diggory
some
one
was
telling
me
the
other
day
that
there
a
curve
in
the
middle
had
we
better
go
back
faltered
mugford
no
you
fathead
shut
up
the
darkness
seemed
to
increase
and
the
silence
grew
oppressive
the
boys
were
walking
in
single
file
diggory
leading
and
jack
vance
bringing
up
the
rear
i
say
exclaimed
the
latter
as
he
stumbled
over
a
sleeper
i
should
like
to
be
caught
here
by
a
train
that
ca
happen
retorted
diggory
did
you
hear
the
man
say
there
was
another
till
yes
added
mugford
but
there
might
be
a
luggage
or
one
coming
the
other
way
well
all
you
have
to
do
would
be
to
cross
over
on
to
the
other
line
imperceptibly
the
boys
quickened
their
pace
until
it
became
almost
a
trot
hurrah
cried
diggory
a
few
moments
later
as
a
semicircle
of
daylight
came
into
view
there
the
other
end
stop
a
minute
cried
jack
emboldened
by
the
prospect
of
soon
being
once
more
in
the
fresh
air
let
see
if
we
can
make
an
echo
the
little
party
halted
for
a
moment
but
instead
of
hearing
the
shrill
yell
for
the
production
of
which
jack
had
just
filled
his
lungs
their
ears
were
greeted
with
a
far
more
terrible
sound
which
caused
their
hearts
to
stop
beating
there
was
it
seemed
a
sudden
boom
followed
by
a
long
continuous
roar
diggory
turned
his
head
to
find
the
patch
of
light
replaced
by
a
spark
of
fiery
red
and
the
terrible
truth
flashed
across
his
mind
that
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
he
could
not
remember
for
certain
which
was
the
down
line
it
was
well
for
the
triple
alliance
that
at
least
one
of
their
number
was
blessed
with
the
faculty
of
quick
decision
and
prompt
action
or
the
history
of
their
friendship
might
have
had
a
tragic
ending
diggory
wheeled
round
and
catching
hold
of
mugford
cried
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
be
heard
above
the
din
quick
get
into
the
way
and
lie
down
what
followed
even
those
who
underwent
the
experience
could
never
clearly
describe
they
flung
themselves
upon
the
ground
there
were
the
thundering
roar
of
an
earthquake
coupled
with
a
deafening
clatter
as
though
the
whole
place
were
falling
about
their
ears
and
a
whirling
hurricane
of
hot
air
and
steam
in
ten
seconds
which
seemed
like
ten
minutes
the
whole
thing
had
come
and
gone
and
diggory
scrambling
to
his
feet
in
the
dense
darkness
of
the
choking
atmosphere
inquired
in
a
shaky
voice
are
you
all
right
you
chaps
there
was
a
reply
in
the
affirmative
and
the
three
boys
proceeded
to
grope
their
way
along
in
silence
until
the
broad
archway
of
the
tunnel
mouth
appeared
through
a
fog
of
steam
and
smoke
i
say
you
fellows
cried
diggory
as
they
emerged
into
the
fresh
air
i
would
go
through
there
again
for
something
it
was
a
good
thing
you
gave
me
that
shove
said
mugford
i
felt
as
though
i
could
move
and
we
were
standing
on
the
very
line
it
went
over
yes
i
could
remember
for
the
moment
which
was
and
which
was
i
thought
too
we
should
be
safer
lying
flat
on
the
ground
when
it
passed
had
we
stood
up
in
the
way
we
might
have
got
giddy
and
fallen
under
the
wheels
the
conversation
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
a
strange
voice
shouting
hullo
you
young
beggars
what
are
you
there
the
boys
turned
to
see
from
whence
this
inquiry
proceeded
up
the
cutting
on
their
left
was
a
little
hut
and
beside
it
stood
the
man
who
had
spoken
the
same
glance
showed
them
another
thing
namely
that
just
beside
this
little
shanty
was
one
of
the
mugford
had
mentioned
warning
the
public
that
persons
found
trespassing
on
the
railway
would
be
prosecuted
come
along
cried
jack
vance
let
bolt
unless
they
doubled
back
into
the
tunnel
their
only
way
of
escape
lay
in
scaling
the
right
side
of
the
cutting
as
a
short
distance
down
the
line
a
gang
of
platelayers
were
at
work
who
would
have
intercepted
them
before
they
reached
the
open
country
come
along
repeated
jack
vance
and
the
next
moment
he
and
his
two
companions
were
clambering
as
fast
as
they
could
up
the
steep
side
of
the
embankment
clutching
at
bushes
and
tufts
of
grass
and
causing
miniature
landslips
of
sand
and
gravel
with
every
step
they
took
the
man
shouted
after
them
to
stop
and
seeing
that
they
paid
no
attention
to
his
commands
promptly
gave
chase
rushing
down
the
narrow
pathway
from
the
hut
and
scrambling
after
them
up
the
opposite
slope
jack
vance
and
diggory
whose
powers
of
wind
and
limb
had
benefited
by
constant
exercise
in
the
football
field
were
soon
at
the
top
but
mugford
who
was
not
inclined
to
be
athletic
and
who
had
already
been
pretty
nearly
pumped
in
hurrying
out
of
the
tunnel
was
still
slowly
dragging
himself
up
the
ascent
panting
and
puffing
like
a
when
his
comrades
reached
the
summit
his
pursuer
was
gaining
on
him
rapidly
and
it
was
in
vain
that
his
two
friends
too
loyal
to
make
good
their
escape
alone
stood
and
with
frantic
gestures
urged
him
to
quicker
movement
just
however
as
the
capture
seemed
certain
a
great
piece
of
loose
earth
giving
way
beneath
the
man
weight
caused
the
latter
to
fall
forward
on
his
face
in
this
posture
he
tobogganed
down
the
slope
with
more
force
than
elegance
and
with
a
yell
of
triumph
jack
and
diggory
stretched
out
their
hands
and
dragged
mugford
up
to
the
level
grassy
plateau
on
which
they
stood
close
behind
them
was
a
wood
and
without
a
moment
hesitation
they
plunged
through
the
hedge
and
dashed
on
through
the
bushes
the
dry
twigs
cracked
and
the
dead
leaves
rustled
beneath
their
feet
suddenly
not
more
than
fifty
yards
away
to
their
right
there
was
the
loud
explosion
of
a
gun
and
almost
at
the
same
instant
a
shouted
hi
there
stop
where
are
you
going
oh
panted
jack
it
one
of
the
keepers
run
for
all
you
worth
the
opposite
edge
of
the
wood
was
not
far
distant
the
three
youngsters
rushed
wildly
on
and
stumbling
blindly
over
the
boundary
hedge
continued
their
mad
gallop
across
a
narrow
field
over
another
hedge
and
they
were
in
a
sunken
roadway
then
came
the
end
mugford
staggered
over
to
the
opposite
bank
and
falling
down
upon
it
with
his
hand
pressed
to
his
side
gasped
out
awful
stitch
ca
go
any
further
years
afterwards
when
the
triple
alliance
met
at
an
old
boys
dinner
they
laughed
heartily
in
talking
over
this
adventure
but
there
were
no
signs
of
mirth
on
any
of
their
faces
at
the
time
it
was
happening
then
as
jack
vance
and
diggory
stood
staring
blankly
at
each
other
in
the
deepening
winter
twilight
they
suddenly
blossomed
out
into
heroes
heroes
it
is
true
in
flannel
and
collars
but
heroes
at
all
events
to
my
mind
as
genuine
in
the
spirit
which
prompted
their
action
as
those
whose
deeds
are
known
in
song
and
story
the
barking
of
a
dog
in
the
field
above
showed
that
the
keeper
was
following
up
their
trail
bun
for
it
panted
mugford
do
wait
for
me
sha
said
jack
and
diggory
in
one
voice
and
the
latter
sticking
his
hands
in
his
trouser
pockets
began
to
whistle
go
on
cried
mugford
sha
repeated
his
companions
it
was
evident
that
the
triple
alliance
would
sink
or
swim
together
and
it
so
happened
that
by
a
piece
of
unexpected
good
fortune
they
were
destined
to
realize
the
latter
alternative
there
was
a
clatter
of
wheels
the
quick
stamp
of
a
horse
and
a
baker
cart
came
swinging
round
the
corner
diggory
whose
wits
never
seemed
to
desert
him
at
a
critical
moment
recognized
it
at
once
as
belonging
to
the
man
who
supplied
the
school
and
springing
forward
he
beckoned
to
the
driver
to
stop
crying
i
say
give
us
a
lift
into
ronleigh
and
we
pay
you
a
shilling
we
belong
to
the
college
the
man
peered
round
the
canvas
covering
and
at
once
recognized
the
boys
cap
and
crest
all
right
he
said
hop
up
i
find
room
for
you
somewhere
the
danger
was
past
with
an
audible
sigh
of
relief
the
three
youngsters
clambered
into
the
vehicle
and
the
next
moment
were
bowling
rapidly
along
in
the
direction
of
the
town
i
say
cried
jack
this
is
a
stroke
of
good
luck
why
we
shall
be
back
in
time
after
all
the
remainder
of
their
conversation
was
lost
to
the
ears
of
the
driver
but
seemed
to
consist
mainly
of
a
series
of
attempts
on
the
part
of
mugford
to
say
something
which
were
always
interrupted
by
a
chorus
of
groans
and
shouts
of
shut
up
from
his
two
companions
at
length
the
cart
arrived
at
ronleigh
and
set
down
the
three
passengers
at
the
corner
of
broad
street
the
principal
thoroughfare
and
here
their
adventures
seemed
to
have
terminated
i
say
because
as
a
matter
of
fact
something
still
remains
to
be
told
in
the
history
of
this
eventful
day
but
before
proceeding
to
the
close
of
the
chapter
it
will
be
well
to
say
a
word
or
two
with
regard
to
a
certain
person
connected
with
it
who
is
as
yet
unknown
to
the
reader
ronleigh
was
fortunate
in
having
a
staff
of
masters
who
won
the
respect
and
confidence
of
the
boys
some
fellows
there
are
who
will
always
abuse
those
set
in
authority
over
them
but
at
ronleigh
there
was
happily
on
the
whole
a
mutual
good
understanding
such
as
might
exist
in
a
well
and
wisely
disciplined
regiment
between
officers
and
men
exceptions
however
prove
the
rule
and
when
at
the
commencement
of
the
present
winter
term
a
new
junior
master
had
come
to
take
charge
of
the
third
form
it
was
evident
from
the
first
that
before
long
there
would
be
trouble
grice
was
a
very
short
man
with
a
pompous
hectoring
manner
which
was
somehow
especially
exasperating
to
fellows
who
stood
a
good
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
the
master
his
rule
was
founded
on
the
fear
of
punishment
and
the
sceptre
which
he
wielded
was
a
small
black
in
which
he
entered
the
names
of
all
offenders
with
an
accompanying
hundred
lines
brown
or
write
the
lesson
out
after
school
smith
lastly
grice
was
not
a
gentleman
boys
i
know
pay
little
attention
to
the
conventionalities
and
are
seldom
found
consulting
books
on
etiquette
but
those
who
have
been
well
brought
up
and
accustomed
at
home
to
an
air
of
refinement
are
quick
to
detect
and
bad
manners
in
those
older
than
themselves
and
who
ought
to
know
better
so
it
came
about
that
grice
was
unpopular
and
the
boys
in
his
class
bemoaned
their
fate
and
called
him
uncomplimentary
nicknames
we
left
the
three
friends
standing
at
the
corner
of
broad
street
the
church
clock
had
just
struck
the
five
and
by
this
time
it
was
dark
though
the
street
was
lit
up
by
the
and
the
long
rows
of
shop
windows
i
hope
no
one
sees
us
said
jack
vance
i
mud
all
over
we
must
look
sharp
or
we
shall
be
late
hullo
exclaimed
diggory
look
out
here
that
wretched
little
grice
coming
there
he
stopped
to
look
into
the
ironmonger
shop
we
must
dodge
past
him
somehow
or
he
want
to
know
where
been
the
trio
crossed
quickly
over
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
and
hurried
off
at
full
speed
in
the
direction
of
the
school
all
boys
were
supposed
to
be
on
the
school
premises
by
five
and
at
that
time
the
door
leading
to
the
outer
world
was
locked
by
the
prefect
for
the
day
oaks
who
happened
to
be
on
duty
was
standing
in
the
passage
talking
to
allingford
when
the
three
juveniles
arrived
out
of
breath
and
flushed
with
running
hullo
you
kids
where
have
you
been
inquired
the
captain
diggory
launched
out
into
a
brief
description
of
their
many
adventures
oaks
laughed
heartily
well
he
said
pulling
out
his
watch
just
got
back
in
time
half
a
minute
more
and
you
have
been
outside
my
boys
the
prefect
locked
the
door
and
continuing
his
conversation
with
allingford
started
off
down
the
passage
on
reaching
what
was
the
main
corridor
on
the
ground
floor
they
paused
for
a
moment
and
stood
warming
their
hands
at
the
pipe
and
it
was
while
thus
engaged
that
they
were
suddenly
accosted
by
grice
who
bustled
up
to
them
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
are
you
on
duty
oaks
yes
sir
have
any
boys
come
in
late
no
sir
well
three
boys
passed
me
in
the
town
i
think
one
of
them
was
young
trevanock
i
called
to
them
to
stop
but
they
took
no
notice
when
they
come
in
you
send
than
to
me
they
were
late
sir
answered
oaks
they
came
in
about
a
minute
ago
oh
nonsense
i
looked
at
my
watch
when
i
saw
them
in
the
town
and
then
it
was
past
they
could
have
come
up
in
five
minutes
you
must
either
have
let
them
in
or
not
closed
the
door
at
the
proper
time
prefects
at
ronleigh
were
not
in
the
habit
of
being
lectured
as
though
they
were
boys
oaks
bit
his
lip
i
closed
the
door
on
the
stroke
of
he
answered
well
you
say
those
boys
came
in
about
two
minutes
ago
by
me
it
now
twenty
to
six
so
they
must
have
been
late
they
were
in
before
sir
your
watch
must
be
wrong
do
keep
contradicting
me
sir
said
the
master
we
are
supposed
to
work
by
the
school
clock
sir
interposed
the
captain
i
not
aware
that
i
addressed
any
remark
to
you
allingford
retorted
grice
rapidly
losing
all
control
of
his
temper
you
need
make
no
further
attempt
to
teach
me
the
rules
of
the
school
i
flatter
myself
that
i
am
sufficiently
well
versed
in
them
already
a
crowd
of
idlers
attracted
by
the
angry
tones
of
the
master
voice
had
begun
to
collect
in
the
passage
and
the
captain
flushed
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
at
being
thus
taken
to
task
in
public
i
merely
said
sir
that
we
work
by
the
school
clock
and
i
say
hold
your
tongue
oaks
remember
you
report
those
three
boys
for
being
late
i
ca
do
that
sir
answered
oaks
stolidly
for
they
were
in
time
grice
boiled
over
you
are
a
very
impertinent
fellow
he
cried
i
shall
report
you
both
to
the
doctor
and
so
saying
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
there
was
a
buzz
of
astonishment
among
the
bystanders
the
idea
of
a
captain
of
ronleigh
being
reported
to
the
doctor
was
something
novel
indeed
and
by
the
time
the
first
bell
rang
for
tea
a
report
of
the
collision
between
grice
and
the
prefects
had
spread
all
over
the
school
chapter
xx
sowing
the
wind
the
passage
of
arms
between
grice
and
the
two
prefects
was
eagerly
discussed
by
boys
of
all
ages
exaggerated
reports
spread
from
mouth
to
mouth
each
teller
of
the
story
adding
to
it
some
details
drawn
from
his
own
imagination
until
away
down
in
the
second
form
it
was
confidently
asserted
that
oaks
had
called
grice
a
little
tin
monkey
and
that
allingford
had
boxed
the
master
ears
which
enormities
would
most
certainly
result
in
the
expulsion
of
the
two
offenders
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
expected
storm
never
burst
the
first
thing
the
doctor
did
on
receiving
grice
complaint
was
to
compare
that
gentleman
watch
with
his
own
hum
he
said
shortly
i
suppose
you
aware
that
you
ten
minutes
fast
a
few
moments
later
grice
withdrew
looking
rather
crestfallen
as
may
be
imagined
the
result
of
his
interview
with
the
was
never
made
public
and
in
the
meantime
ronleians
old
and
young
were
expressing
their
high
approval
of
the
conduct
of
their
captain
and
his
lieutenant
the
gilt
was
beginning
to
wear
off
the
thurstonian
gingerbread
and
sensible
fellows
who
could
tell
the
difference
between
jewel
and
paste
were
less
inclined
than
ever
to
be
led
by
the
nose
by
such
fellows
as
gull
and
hawley
here
was
an
instance
in
which
the
prefects
had
taken
a
stand
against
palpable
injustice
and
the
action
had
caused
the
whole
body
to
rise
several
pegs
in
estimation
the
near
approach
of
the
wraxby
football
match
caused
a
revival
of
good
honest
public
spirit
if
only
ronleigh
could
beat
the
grammar
school
this
year
at
footer
as
well
as
at
cricket
every
one
felt
that
their
cup
of
joy
would
run
over
and
the
champions
who
were
to
strive
for
the
victory
were
naturally
regarded
for
the
time
being
as
standing
on
more
exalted
ground
than
their
fellows
ever
since
the
exposure
of
fletcher
senior
as
the
author
of
college
town
the
poem
had
become
a
weapon
turned
against
the
writer
and
his
party
boys
had
gone
to
the
bottom
of
the
matter
and
discovering
the
real
reason
of
thurston
absence
from
the
team
had
declared
that
a
fellow
who
out
of
spite
would
refuse
to
give
his
services
to
uphold
the
honour
of
the
school
had
forfeited
all
claim
on
their
consideration
or
sympathy
such
was
the
state
of
popular
feeling
when
with
the
clang
of
the
bell
on
thursday
morning
the
twelfth
of
december
a
day
commenced
fraught
with
unexpected
episodes
and
situations
closely
affecting
the
interests
of
the
triple
alliance
one
might
have
thought
that
their
adventures
on
the
previous
afternoon
had
afforded
them
sufficient
excitement
for
at
least
one
week
but
these
were
destined
to
prove
but
the
prelude
to
an
event
of
still
greater
importance
the
three
friends
went
into
school
at
nine
looking
forlorn
and
miserable
something
indeed
had
happened
to
mar
their
happiness
and
the
cause
of
their
depression
was
as
follows
soon
after
breakfast
when
the
contents
of
the
had
been
distributed
as
usual
mugford
accosted
his
two
chums
who
were
strolling
up
and
down
the
quadrangle
a
look
of
abject
misery
was
on
his
face
and
in
his
hand
he
held
an
open
letter
hullo
cried
jack
vance
what
up
you
look
as
if
you
had
lost
a
sovereign
and
found
sixpence
matter
enough
murmured
mugford
whose
heart
was
evidently
in
his
mouth
i
going
to
leave
going
to
leave
exclaimed
diggory
what
ever
mean
well
i
do
mind
telling
you
fellows
answered
the
other
you
know
my
is
well
off
and
he
says
he
lost
money
and
ca
afford
to
keep
me
at
ronleigh
i
know
i
no
good
and
you
fellows
get
on
all
right
without
me
and
the
sentence
not
being
completed
the
two
other
boys
glanced
at
the
speaker
face
and
from
previous
indications
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
were
not
surprised
to
find
that
he
was
crying
two
years
appear
a
long
time
when
one
is
on
the
bright
side
of
twenty
and
the
friendship
seemed
to
have
lasted
for
ages
at
the
near
prospect
of
separation
all
mugford
little
failings
were
forgotten
and
both
diggory
and
jack
vance
felt
that
life
without
him
would
be
a
blank
oh
dash
it
all
said
the
latter
you
must
go
is
there
anything
we
can
do
shall
i
write
to
your
the
idea
of
jack
vance
addressing
a
remonstrance
to
his
respected
parent
caused
the
ghost
of
a
smile
to
appear
on
mugford
doleful
face
no
it
no
good
he
answered
there
nothing
for
it
i
shall
have
to
leave
during
the
interval
which
divided
morning
school
and
the
free
time
before
dinner
the
three
friends
mooned
about
together
trying
in
vain
to
regard
the
future
in
a
more
cheerful
light
and
to
make
plans
for
keeping
touch
of
each
other
by
an
interchange
of
letters
and
a
possible
meeting
in
the
holidays
it
all
very
well
said
jack
vance
to
diggory
when
late
on
in
the
afternoon
he
happened
to
come
across
the
latter
flattening
his
nose
against
the
glass
of
the
window
it
all
very
well
talking
about
writing
and
all
that
but
this
is
the
end
of
the
triple
alliance
yes
answered
diggory
after
a
moment
thought
i
suppose
it
is
i
wish
we
could
do
something
more
before
it
broken
up
as
he
spoke
he
passed
his
hand
mechanically
along
the
lower
surface
of
the
window
ledge
then
with
a
sudden
exclamation
he
went
down
on
his
knees
and
picked
something
out
of
the
wall
it
was
another
note
written
in
cipher
the
missive
was
certainly
very
brief
consisting
of
only
seven
letters
glmrtsg
hullo
said
jack
vance
they
at
it
again
his
companion
made
no
reply
but
taking
out
a
pencil
copied
the
cipher
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
and
then
replaced
the
mysterious
document
in
the
crack
between
the
and
the
bricks
what
are
you
doing
that
for
why
because
they
may
miss
it
and
smell
a
rat
come
on
let
get
the
key
and
see
what
it
means
in
this
instance
the
translation
of
the
cryptograph
did
not
occupy
much
time
diggory
produced
his
double
alphabet
and
soon
spelt
out
the
word
the
two
chums
gazed
at
each
other
for
a
few
moments
in
silence
what
does
it
mean
queried
jack
i
do
know
unless
it
is
that
they
are
going
to
have
another
meeting
after
tea
under
the
pavilion
let
find
mug
and
hear
what
he
thinks
in
discussing
their
new
find
and
attempting
to
solve
its
meaning
the
three
friends
forgot
for
the
time
being
the
melancholy
tidings
they
had
received
that
morning
and
gave
themselves
up
to
a
full
enjoyment
of
the
mystery
i
ca
see
said
mugford
that
it
means
anything
else
than
that
they
are
going
to
have
another
meeting
yes
that
it
i
shall
go
down
to
the
pavilion
again
after
tea
and
see
what
up
i
should
wonder
if
there
is
going
to
be
another
row
fletcher
said
he
meant
to
do
something
before
he
left
and
there
much
time
now
before
the
end
of
the
term
sha
mug
or
i
go
this
time
asked
jack
vance
it
rather
a
risky
business
no
i
go
i
know
now
just
where
to
hide
during
the
between
tea
and
evening
preparation
jack
vance
and
mugford
lingered
about
in
the
dark
and
deserted
quadrangle
anxiously
awaiting
their
comrade
return
once
only
was
the
silence
broken
by
maxton
chasing
young
rats
from
the
gymnasium
into
the
big
school
shouting
i
lick
you
you
little
villain
but
with
this
exception
our
two
friends
had
the
place
to
themselves
it
was
a
raw
cold
night
every
one
seemed
very
naturally
to
be
keeping
indoors
and
there
were
no
signs
of
any
members
of
the
secret
society
being
abroad
jack
vance
and
his
companion
trotted
softly
up
and
down
endeavouring
to
keep
themselves
warm
at
length
when
their
patience
was
wellnigh
exhausted
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
and
diggory
was
descried
coming
through
the
archway
leading
to
the
playing
fields
well
cried
his
two
chums
in
low
eager
tones
what
have
you
heard
the
answer
was
certainly
one
they
had
least
expected
nothing
nothing
what
mean
why
they
did
come
there
was
any
meeting
i
waited
and
waited
until
i
saw
it
was
no
use
staying
any
longer
so
then
i
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
did
the
note
really
say
yes
i
went
down
just
before
tea
to
see
if
it
was
still
there
and
i
brought
it
away
with
me
here
look
for
yourself
as
he
spoke
diggory
produced
the
slip
of
paper
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
by
the
light
of
the
archway
lamp
it
was
compared
with
a
key
and
the
former
translation
was
found
to
be
correct
the
triple
alliance
had
certainly
for
once
in
a
way
drawn
blank
and
the
preparation
bell
putting
an
end
to
their
further
deliberations
they
directed
their
steps
toward
the
schoolroom
wondering
more
than
ever
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
that
significant
word
now
the
real
reason
of
the
three
friends
being
thus
at
fault
in
their
investigations
was
simply
this
they
were
exactly
hours
behindhand
in
their
attempt
to
unravel
the
mystery
the
conclusion
they
had
come
to
with
regard
to
the
meaning
of
the
note
was
correct
a
tacit
understanding
had
existed
for
some
time
among
the
inner
circle
of
the
thurstonian
party
that
this
should
be
the
signal
for
a
gathering
of
the
clan
but
the
note
when
diggory
had
found
it
had
been
lying
in
the
impromptu
post
office
for
a
day
and
a
half
and
the
meeting
to
which
it
was
a
summons
had
already
taken
place
on
the
previous
evening
for
the
reader
who
is
a
privileged
person
we
intend
to
put
back
the
clock
and
leaving
the
triple
alliance
dividing
their
attention
between
attempts
to
discover
the
meaning
first
of
their
latin
author
and
secondly
of
the
enigma
formed
by
this
perplexing
epistle
we
will
give
a
short
account
of
the
gathering
to
which
it
referred
it
was
while
the
greater
number
of
their
were
gathered
in
numerous
little
groups
whiling
away
the
free
time
before
preparation
discussing
the
various
rumours
that
were
current
respecting
encounters
with
oaks
and
allingford
that
the
same
five
conspirators
assembled
for
another
secret
confab
in
the
den
beneath
the
pavilion
in
one
way
it
was
a
fortunate
thing
for
diggory
that
he
did
not
discover
the
note
sooner
for
hardly
had
thurston
set
the
lighted
candle
in
the
empty
bottle
than
noaks
picked
it
up
and
peered
carefully
into
each
of
the
four
corners
and
behind
the
heaps
of
benches
and
other
lumber
what
are
you
doing
that
for
asked
gull
oh
only
to
see
that
no
one
come
who
was
invited
remember
last
time
what
a
stink
there
was
of
a
burnt
fusee
well
after
gone
i
found
young
trevanock
knocking
about
the
field
and
i
swear
but
what
he
knew
something
about
our
meeting
i
searched
the
young
beggar
pockets
but
he
had
got
any
more
lights
so
i
let
him
go
the
party
grouped
themselves
round
the
candle
as
they
had
done
on
the
previous
occasion
when
diggory
had
watched
their
movements
from
behind
the
pile
of
forms
and
thurston
with
an
inquiring
look
at
fletcher
asked
well
what
the
object
of
this
pleasant
little
reunion
i
suppose
you
can
pretty
well
guess
answered
the
other
the
last
time
we
were
here
we
all
agreed
that
before
the
end
of
the
term
was
up
we
get
even
chalks
with
allingford
and
well
seeing
there
only
eight
days
left
i
thought
it
was
about
time
we
had
another
meeting
and
decided
what
we
were
going
to
added
the
speaker
turning
with
something
like
a
sneer
on
his
lips
and
addressing
his
chum
it
the
wraxby
match
on
saturday
i
suppose
they
have
asked
you
to
play
in
the
team
the
shaft
went
home
and
thurston
face
darkened
with
anger
no
he
answered
indignantly
and
i
would
play
not
if
they
all
went
down
on
their
knees
and
begged
me
to
what
do
i
care
about
the
wraxby
match
if
i
could
i
put
a
stopper
on
it
and
bring
the
whole
thing
to
the
ground
well
continued
fletcher
calmly
that
just
what
we
going
to
do
if
you
asked
me
this
morning
how
we
could
put
a
spoke
in
wheel
and
pay
out
him
and
a
lot
of
those
other
prigs
like
oaks
and
rowlands
i
could
have
told
you
but
now
the
thing
as
easy
as
pat
they
find
out
they
have
me
at
every
turn
and
corner
for
nothing
i
give
them
tit
for
tat
and
after
christmas
when
i
left
this
beastly
place
i
write
and
tell
them
who
did
it
you
seem
to
have
got
your
back
up
old
chap
said
thurston
referring
to
the
bitter
tones
in
which
the
last
few
sentences
had
been
spoken
but
out
with
it
what
your
plan
why
this
i
no
idea
what
a
chance
we
should
have
when
i
stuck
that
note
in
our
but
here
it
is
all
ready
made
allingford
and
oaks
have
had
a
row
with
little
grice
he
reported
them
and
quite
natural
they
should
want
to
pay
him
out
for
doing
it
as
such
good
boys
i
do
suppose
they
try
anything
of
the
kind
but
we
might
undertake
the
job
and
do
it
for
them
the
speaker
paused
to
see
if
he
had
been
understood
what
exclaimed
thurston
bluntly
you
mean
play
grice
a
trick
and
make
it
appear
they
done
it
because
of
this
rumpus
about
locking
the
door
that
about
it
returned
the
other
laughing
what
could
we
do
better
noaks
murmured
his
approval
of
the
scheme
but
gull
and
hawley
were
silent
to
tell
the
truth
since
the
big
row
following
their
attack
on
browse
had
put
a
stop
to
any
further
chance
of
and
other
amusements
in
thurston
study
their
attachment
to
the
had
considerably
lessened
like
many
others
of
their
kind
they
were
thoroughly
selfish
at
heart
and
saw
no
good
in
running
any
personal
risk
to
settle
the
quarrels
of
a
third
person
the
party
feeling
which
had
characterized
the
last
school
elections
and
caused
for
the
time
being
a
spirit
of
and
opposition
towards
the
school
leaders
had
just
about
died
a
natural
death
and
if
another
public
meeting
had
been
called
in
the
gymnasium
not
half
a
dozen
fellows
would
have
shouted
for
thurston
or
allied
themselves
against
the
side
of
law
and
order
all
this
had
tended
to
make
hawley
and
gull
lukewarm
in
their
adherence
to
the
cause
noaks
however
who
would
have
paid
any
price
for
the
privilege
of
being
able
to
hobnob
with
those
who
were
in
any
higher
position
than
himself
was
ready
to
follow
his
two
sixth
form
cronies
to
any
extreme
they
might
suggest
well
he
inquired
and
what
to
be
the
trick
i
only
just
thought
of
one
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
answered
fletcher
but
if
no
one
else
has
a
better
to
suggest
i
daresay
do
we
might
screw
up
little
grice
bedroom
door
so
as
to
get
him
down
late
in
the
morning
his
room
right
away
at
the
end
of
the
passage
there
is
a
belonging
to
oaks
lying
in
one
of
the
empty
lockers
it
has
his
name
on
the
handle
and
if
we
happened
to
drop
it
as
we
came
away
i
think
that
in
the
face
of
this
row
it
would
look
uncommonly
like
his
doing
twig
there
was
something
so
mean
and
cowardly
in
this
scheme
and
in
the
manner
in
which
the
proposal
was
made
that
even
thurston
gave
vent
to
an
exclamation
of
contempt
so
that
your
little
game
is
it
he
inquired
yes
that
it
that
my
little
project
for
putting
a
stop
to
the
wraxby
match
there
be
an
awful
row
and
the
doctor
keep
the
team
from
going
now
then
who
do
the
trick
will
you
hawley
no
fear
answered
hawley
gull
and
i
did
most
of
the
last
two
it
some
one
else
turn
now
suppose
you
do
it
yourself
as
it
your
idea
fletcher
frowned
in
matters
of
this
sort
he
liked
to
make
the
plans
and
get
others
to
execute
them
well
i
was
thinking
one
of
you
might
he
began
oh
bother
interrupted
thurston
whose
revengeful
spirit
had
been
once
more
aroused
by
the
mention
of
the
wraxby
match
it
nothing
you
and
i
do
it
and
i
help
if
you
like
added
noaks
who
thought
the
present
occasion
a
good
opportunity
to
distinguish
himself
all
right
continued
thurston
you
go
down
town
and
get
some
screws
noaks
two
or
three
good
long
ones
well
we
fix
night
said
fletcher
keep
awake
and
meet
at
the
top
of
b
staircase
say
at
one
then
there
no
fear
but
what
every
one
be
asleep
the
triple
alliance
had
for
some
hours
ceased
to
puzzle
their
brains
over
either
virgil
or
cipher
notes
and
the
whole
of
ronleigh
college
was
apparently
wrapped
in
slumber
when
three
shadowy
figures
assembled
on
the
landing
at
the
top
of
staircase
b
and
proceeded
noiselessly
along
the
corridor
and
down
the
side
passage
at
the
end
of
which
grice
room
was
situated
have
you
got
the
screws
yes
answered
noaks
producing
a
twist
of
paper
from
his
pocket
do
you
think
i
better
go
and
keep
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
whispered
fletcher
no
returned
thurston
noaks
can
do
that
i
make
the
two
holes
and
you
must
put
the
screws
in
you
the
best
carpenter
of
the
lot
standing
in
the
cold
dark
passage
the
work
seemed
to
take
ages
to
perform
but
at
length
it
was
finished
hist
what
are
you
doing
fletcher
had
produced
a
scrap
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
was
seemingly
about
to
slip
it
under
the
door
i
want
to
make
certain
that
it
shall
be
put
down
to
oaks
he
whispered
so
in
case
the
should
be
overlooked
i
going
to
slip
this
under
the
door
for
grice
to
find
in
the
morning
thurston
glanced
at
the
paper
and
saw
printed
thereon
in
bold
capitals
the
following
inscription
be
in
time
by
the
school
clock
chapter
xxi
reaping
the
whirlwind
work
at
ronleigh
commenced
with
a
sort
of
preliminary
practice
in
the
various
classrooms
the
school
then
assembled
for
prayers
after
which
came
breakfast
during
the
progress
of
this
meal
on
the
friday
morning
in
the
small
hours
of
which
had
been
enacted
the
scene
described
at
the
end
of
the
previous
chapter
it
became
evident
that
something
was
up
the
table
at
which
sat
most
of
the
boys
of
the
third
form
was
in
a
state
of
great
disorder
while
the
discussion
of
some
topic
of
unusual
interest
seemed
to
be
occupying
the
attention
of
the
prefects
it
was
not
however
until
after
the
boys
had
swarmed
out
of
the
that
the
reason
of
this
subdued
commotion
became
generally
known
and
then
like
the
sudden
report
of
an
explosion
every
one
seemed
to
become
acquainted
with
the
news
at
the
same
moment
grice
had
been
screwed
up
in
his
bedroom
oaks
and
allingford
had
done
it
the
doctor
had
summoned
them
to
meet
him
in
his
study
it
was
from
a
member
of
the
third
form
that
the
triple
alliance
heard
the
particulars
of
what
had
happened
grice
said
this
young
gentleman
whose
own
height
was
about
four
feet
two
inches
grice
never
turned
up
until
just
before
the
bell
rang
for
prayers
and
then
he
was
simply
bursting
with
rage
and
told
us
all
about
it
put
a
note
under
his
door
telling
him
to
be
in
time
by
the
school
clock
and
besides
that
when
one
of
the
men
went
to
get
him
out
he
found
a
with
oaks
name
on
so
it
as
clear
as
day
who
did
it
this
conversation
took
place
in
the
quadrangle
travers
the
third
form
boy
rushed
off
to
impart
his
information
to
other
hearers
and
the
three
chums
passed
on
through
the
archway
and
came
to
a
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
paved
playground
well
asked
diggory
who
did
it
who
think
it
was
retorted
jack
vance
why
some
of
thurston
lot
i
believe
so
do
i
mugford
who
was
always
rather
slow
at
grasping
a
new
idea
opened
his
eyes
in
astonishment
but
he
exclaimed
how
about
the
paper
and
the
pooh
answered
diggory
how
about
that
cipher
note
that
said
of
course
added
jack
vance
they
evidently
arranged
it
beforehand
and
that
paper
was
to
say
when
they
were
to
do
the
trick
it
seems
possible
sometimes
to
come
by
wrong
roads
to
a
right
conclusion
and
though
the
boys
were
mistaken
in
changing
from
their
first
opinion
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
note
yet
in
this
instance
their
error
caused
them
to
hit
the
right
nail
on
the
head
it
was
one
of
thurston
lot
who
did
it
repeated
diggory
decisively
neither
oaks
nor
allingford
would
ever
dream
of
doing
such
a
mad
thing
i
do
see
exactly
how
you
can
prove
it
said
jack
vance
thoughtfully
that
one
word
might
mean
anything
of
course
it
no
proof
in
itself
answered
the
other
but
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
if
the
doctor
or
any
other
sensible
chap
knew
all
we
do
about
the
cipher
and
what
they
said
at
their
last
meeting
he
would
doubt
for
a
moment
but
that
it
was
one
of
them
who
screwed
up
grice
door
travers
says
the
doctor
has
sent
for
oaks
and
old
ally
it
be
an
awful
shame
if
they
get
into
a
row
i
do
see
how
they
are
going
to
get
out
of
it
sighed
mugford
then
i
do
answered
diggory
stoutly
with
a
sudden
flash
in
his
bright
eyes
the
triple
alliance
can
get
them
out
how
why
we
must
tell
all
we
know
and
show
denson
the
note
when
now
wo
it
be
sneaking
i
should
consider
we
were
beastly
sneaks
if
we
did
so
we
should
be
exclaimed
jack
vance
they
always
been
jolly
decent
to
us
and
it
was
on
our
account
they
had
this
row
with
grice
if
noaks
finds
we
split
he
send
that
knife
to
the
police
said
mugford
i
do
care
a
straw
what
noaks
does
answered
diggory
boldly
you
fellows
need
have
anything
to
do
with
it
i
go
and
tell
denson
myself
no
i
come
too
said
jack
so
i
added
mugford
and
off
they
started
it
was
always
a
great
ordeal
to
enter
the
doctor
study
even
in
what
might
be
termed
times
of
peace
and
now
as
diggory
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
in
answer
to
the
muffled
come
in
which
had
followed
his
knock
the
three
friends
experienced
a
sudden
shortness
of
breath
and
an
unpleasant
sinking
sensation
at
the
pit
of
the
stomach
the
two
prefects
were
standing
at
the
front
of
the
allingford
face
was
very
white
and
oaks
very
red
for
all
the
world
like
the
wars
of
the
roses
as
jack
vance
afterwards
remarked
though
it
would
be
difficult
to
clearly
understand
the
simile
the
glanced
round
for
a
moment
to
see
who
had
entered
the
room
and
without
taking
any
further
notice
of
the
three
juveniles
continued
the
speech
he
was
in
the
act
of
making
when
they
entered
the
apartment
i
am
not
going
to
defend
the
action
of
grice
he
was
saying
we
are
all
apt
to
make
mistakes
and
i
will
tell
you
candidly
that
on
this
occasion
i
think
grice
was
unwise
but
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
uphold
the
authority
of
my
masters
if
boys
consider
they
are
not
justly
dealt
with
they
have
me
to
appeal
to
but
the
idea
that
disputes
between
the
two
should
be
settled
by
practical
joking
is
simply
outrageous
this
is
the
first
instance
of
the
kind
that
i
ever
remember
to
have
happened
at
ronleigh
and
i
tell
you
plainly
that
i
am
determined
to
make
an
example
of
the
offenders
i
assure
you
sir
said
oaks
in
a
low
agitated
voice
that
we
have
had
no
hand
in
this
matter
i
am
sorry
even
to
seem
to
doubt
your
word
oaks
answered
the
doctor
but
i
think
you
must
own
that
appearances
are
very
much
against
you
a
bearing
your
name
was
found
in
the
passage
and
this
piece
of
paper
which
was
pushed
under
the
bedroom
door
and
which
now
lies
before
me
bears
a
direct
reference
to
the
dispute
about
the
school
time
as
far
as
i
can
see
at
present
the
only
conclusion
which
can
be
arrived
at
is
that
this
is
an
act
of
retaliation
which
has
sprung
from
your
contention
with
mr
grice
the
captain
was
about
to
speak
but
denson
held
up
his
hand
as
i
said
before
he
continued
i
am
sorry
allingford
even
to
appear
to
doubt
your
word
i
have
always
had
reason
to
rely
with
confidence
upon
the
integrity
and
honour
of
my
prefects
and
believe
me
this
interview
is
to
me
an
exceedingly
painful
one
the
matter
however
is
too
serious
to
be
passed
over
lightly
and
you
must
hear
me
to
the
end
the
conduct
of
the
school
during
the
present
term
has
been
far
from
satisfactory
two
acts
of
gross
misconduct
have
already
been
committed
and
i
can
not
but
blame
those
whom
i
hold
mainly
responsible
for
the
order
of
the
school
that
in
both
instances
the
offenders
should
have
gone
unpunished
it
seems
hardly
possible
to
me
that
such
things
should
happen
without
its
coming
to
the
ears
of
the
prefects
who
were
the
perpetrators
of
the
deeds
in
question
here
we
have
a
third
example
of
the
same
thing
if
neither
of
you
took
any
actual
part
in
screwing
up
this
door
i
am
still
inclined
to
think
that
you
must
have
been
cognizant
of
the
act
and
i
demand
to
know
the
names
of
the
offenders
take
time
to
think
before
you
answer
i
warn
you
once
more
that
i
am
determined
to
sift
the
matter
to
the
bottom
once
more
the
two
prefects
protested
that
they
had
not
the
remotest
idea
who
had
played
the
trick
on
grice
denson
frowned
and
sat
for
some
moments
without
speaking
rapping
the
in
front
of
him
with
the
butt
end
of
a
seal
then
remembering
the
presence
of
the
small
boys
he
turned
towards
them
with
an
inquiring
look
well
diggory
face
wore
something
of
the
same
expression
which
jack
and
mugford
had
seen
upon
it
when
long
ago
their
friend
first
distinguished
himself
at
the
birches
by
going
down
the
slide
on
skates
he
gave
a
nervous
little
cough
and
advancing
towards
the
table
laid
thereon
the
cipher
note
at
the
same
time
remarking
if
you
please
sir
we
know
who
screwed
up
little
hem
grice
door
or
at
all
events
we
think
we
do
so
sudden
and
unexpected
was
this
announcement
that
it
caused
the
doctor
to
half
rise
from
his
chair
while
oaks
and
allingford
turned
and
gazed
at
the
speaker
in
astonishment
they
none
of
them
expected
for
a
moment
that
the
three
youngsters
had
come
for
any
more
important
purpose
than
to
solicit
orders
for
new
caps
or
and
this
confession
came
like
a
thunderbolt
from
a
clear
sky
what
exclaimed
the
taking
the
scrap
of
paper
and
glancing
alternately
from
the
mystic
word
to
the
boy
face
what
on
earth
is
this
explain
yourself
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
attempt
a
verbatim
report
of
evidence
in
doing
so
we
should
but
be
repeating
facts
with
which
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
with
many
haltings
and
stumbles
he
gave
a
full
account
of
his
finding
the
first
cipher
translating
the
same
attending
the
secret
meeting
and
lastly
discovering
on
the
previous
day
the
brief
note
which
he
had
just
produced
the
telling
of
the
tale
occupied
some
considerable
time
for
the
doctor
had
many
questions
to
ask
and
when
it
came
to
the
account
of
the
conversation
which
had
taken
place
under
the
pavilion
his
face
visibly
darkened
my
eye
remarked
diggory
an
hour
later
i
would
go
through
that
again
for
something
i
swear
that
by
the
time
i
finished
the
perspiration
was
running
down
my
back
in
a
regular
stream
well
said
the
doctor
turning
to
jack
vance
and
mugford
when
their
companion
had
finished
speaking
and
what
have
you
two
got
to
say
only
the
same
as
trevanock
sir
we
we
found
it
out
together
then
in
the
first
place
why
did
you
tell
me
all
this
before
we
were
afraid
to
sir
faltered
jack
vance
and
we
thought
it
would
be
sneaking
dear
dear
exclaimed
the
impatiently
when
will
you
boys
see
things
in
a
proper
light
you
think
it
wrong
to
tell
tales
and
yet
quite
right
that
innocent
people
should
suffer
for
things
done
by
these
miserable
cowards
no
sir
answered
diggory
we
come
now
to
try
to
get
oaks
out
of
a
scrape
though
we
were
afraid
afraid
of
what
nothing
sir
afraid
of
telling
more
tales
i
suppose
well
well
the
question
now
is
whether
the
same
boys
are
guilty
of
having
screwed
up
door
why
they
should
have
done
such
a
thing
i
do
understand
nor
do
i
see
how
it
is
to
be
brought
home
to
them
simply
by
means
of
this
exceedingly
brief
note
there
was
a
silence
diggory
glanced
up
and
received
a
look
from
the
two
prefects
that
amply
repaid
him
for
the
trying
ordeal
through
which
he
had
just
passed
jack
vance
leaned
over
to
whisper
something
in
his
ear
when
their
attention
was
attracted
by
an
exclamation
of
surprise
from
denson
aha
what
does
this
mean
look
here
allingford
every
member
of
the
company
edged
forward
and
looking
down
at
what
lay
on
the
saw
in
a
moment
that
the
mystery
was
solved
the
communication
which
had
been
slipped
under
the
bedroom
door
was
written
on
a
of
a
similar
piece
of
stationery
had
been
used
for
the
cipher
note
the
had
accidentally
brought
them
together
on
his
and
the
rough
torn
edge
of
the
one
fitted
exactly
into
the
corresponding
side
of
the
other
they
had
both
unmistakably
come
from
the
same
source
even
the
dread
atmosphere
of
the
doctor
study
could
not
restrain
some
show
of
excitement
on
the
part
of
those
interested
in
this
disclosure
but
it
was
quickly
suppressed
oaks
said
the
doctor
go
and
give
my
compliments
to
cowland
and
ask
him
to
open
school
for
me
and
at
the
same
time
inform
the
following
boys
that
i
wish
to
see
them
at
once
here
in
my
study
fletcher
one
thurston
gull
hawley
and
noaks
to
the
triple
alliance
hours
seemed
to
pass
before
a
shuffling
of
feet
in
the
passage
announced
the
arrival
of
the
thurstonians
one
by
one
they
filed
into
the
room
the
door
was
shut
and
there
was
a
moment
of
awful
silence
even
diggory
trembled
and
allingford
noticing
it
laid
his
big
hand
reassuringly
on
the
small
boy
shoulder
i
wish
to
know
began
the
doctor
which
of
you
boys
were
concerned
in
what
took
place
last
night
i
refer
of
course
to
the
screwing
up
of
grice
bedroom
door
no
one
spoke
but
fletcher
turned
pale
to
the
lips
had
you
anything
to
do
with
it
fletcher
no
sir
then
will
you
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
continued
the
holding
up
the
cipher
note
i
i
do
know
what
it
means
began
the
prefect
do
lie
to
me
sir
interrupted
the
doctor
sternly
you
know
very
well
what
it
means
it
of
your
own
invention
thurston
saw
clearly
that
the
game
was
up
and
with
the
recklessness
of
despair
decided
at
once
to
accept
the
inevitable
i
screwed
up
grice
door
he
said
sullenly
and
who
assisted
you
to
this
inquiry
thurston
would
give
no
reply
but
maintained
a
dogged
silence
gull
and
hawley
however
anxious
at
all
costs
to
save
their
own
skins
practically
answered
the
question
by
saying
we
did
and
casting
significant
glances
at
noaks
and
fletcher
what
followed
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
describe
in
detail
the
five
culprits
were
subjected
to
a
merciless
during
which
a
confession
not
only
of
their
various
transgressions
but
also
of
the
motives
which
had
prompted
them
to
adopt
such
a
line
of
conduct
was
dragged
from
their
unwilling
lips
the
cloak
was
torn
off
and
the
cowardice
and
meanness
of
their
actions
appeared
plainly
revealed
and
were
forced
home
even
to
their
own
hearts
thurston
and
fletcher
said
the
doctor
when
at
length
long
after
the
bell
had
rung
for
interval
the
inquiry
concluded
go
to
your
studies
and
remain
there
till
you
hear
from
me
noaks
go
in
like
manner
to
the
housekeeper
gull
and
hawley
as
you
seem
to
have
taken
no
active
part
in
this
last
misdemeanour
you
may
go
as
regards
your
previous
misconduct
i
shall
speak
to
you
on
that
subject
when
i
have
decided
what
is
to
be
done
with
your
companions
for
the
triple
alliance
the
remainder
of
the
day
passed
in
a
whirl
of
conflicting
emotions
in
a
very
short
time
the
whole
school
knew
exactly
what
had
taken
place
in
the
doctor
study
and
every
boy
was
incensed
at
the
underhanded
meanness
of
this
attempted
attack
on
oaks
and
allingford
it
was
a
good
thing
for
thurston
and
fletcher
that
they
had
their
studies
and
noaks
the
housekeeper
room
in
which
to
find
shelter
or
they
would
have
been
compelled
to
run
the
gauntlet
hawley
and
gull
though
not
found
guilty
on
this
particular
count
were
hustled
and
abused
for
their
former
misdeeds
which
it
was
perfectly
evident
would
be
remembered
against
them
during
the
remainder
of
their
life
at
ronleigh
as
for
diggory
and
his
two
chums
never
were
three
small
boys
made
so
much
of
before
what
was
the
cipher
how
did
they
find
it
out
these
and
a
hundred
other
questions
were
continually
being
dinned
in
their
ears
coupled
with
slaps
on
the
back
ejaculations
of
well
done
you
a
precious
sharp
lot
and
many
other
expressions
of
approval
at
the
close
of
this
eventful
day
two
things
alone
remained
vividly
impressed
upon
their
minds
the
first
was
an
interview
with
allingford
and
oaks
in
the
study
well
said
the
captain
you
kids
have
done
us
a
good
turn
we
were
in
a
precious
awkward
box
and
i
do
know
how
we
should
have
got
out
of
it
if
it
had
been
for
you
yes
added
oaks
i
was
never
more
surprised
at
anything
in
my
life
than
when
trevanock
said
he
knew
who
done
the
business
it
made
old
denson
open
his
eyes
so
it
did
continued
allingford
and
if
it
had
come
out
the
whole
school
would
have
got
into
another
precious
row
and
there
have
been
a
stop
put
to
the
wraxby
match
i
tell
you
what
you
youngsters
thought
it
sneaking
to
let
out
what
you
knew
in
my
opinion
you
have
been
jolly
sneaks
if
you
shielded
those
blackguards
and
allowed
everyone
else
to
suffer
well
as
i
said
before
you
done
is
a
good
turn
and
as
long
as
we
at
ronleigh
together
we
sha
forget
you
the
second
thing
which
lodged
in
the
recollection
of
the
three
friends
was
a
look
which
noaks
had
bestowed
upon
them
as
he
passed
out
of
the
doctor
study
did
you
see
his
face
said
diggory
he
looked
as
if
he
could
have
killed
us
he
never
forgiven
us
since
that
time
he
was
turned
off
the
football
field
for
striking
you
at
the
birches
no
added
jack
vance
and
then
we
were
the
means
of
old
noaks
getting
the
sack
over
those
fireworks
and
that
reminds
me
he
always
had
a
grudge
against
me
for
letting
out
that
time
that
his
father
was
a
servant
man
and
now
there
this
last
row
oh
yes
he
do
his
best
now
to
get
us
into
a
bother
over
that
knife
of
mugford
of
course
he
will
answered
diggory
that
what
he
meant
by
glaring
at
us
as
he
did
i
do
care
exclaimed
jack
vance
with
forced
bravado
he
prove
we
stole
the
coins
of
course
he
ca
sighed
mugford
but
if
there
a
row
it
rather
spoil
our
christmas
chapter
xxii
when
shall
we
three
meet
again
the
wraxby
match
was
played
and
won
allingford
and
his
men
journeyed
to
the
neighbouring
town
so
gaming
the
additional
credit
of
a
victory
on
their
opponents
ground
and
thus
for
the
first
time
for
many
years
ronleigh
lowered
the
flag
of
their
ancient
rivals
both
at
cricket
and
at
football
hurrah
cried
rats
who
was
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
when
the
news
arrived
they
wo
ask
us
again
if
we
like
to
play
a
master
the
cheeky
beggars
the
same
afternoon
on
which
ronleigh
so
distinguished
herself
saw
also
the
melancholy
ending
of
the
school
life
of
two
of
her
number
thurston
and
fletcher
one
went
home
to
return
no
more
practically
expelled
though
the
doctor
in
this
instance
did
not
make
a
public
example
of
their
departure
another
thing
happened
on
this
memorable
day
which
caused
quite
a
sensation
especially
among
the
members
of
the
upper
and
lower
divisions
of
the
fourth
form
i
say
have
you
heard
the
latest
cried
maxton
bursting
into
the
just
before
preparation
regardless
alike
of
the
presence
of
lucas
and
the
rule
relating
to
silence
what
about
asked
several
voices
why
about
noaks
no
well
then
he
run
away
magazines
and
papers
fell
from
the
hands
which
held
them
and
the
usual
quiet
of
the
room
was
broken
by
a
buzz
of
astonishment
run
away
go
on
you
do
mean
it
i
do
though
he
skedaddled
right
enough
and
they
ca
find
him
anywhere
the
report
was
only
too
true
afraid
to
face
his
schoolfellows
and
having
already
received
several
intimations
from
fellows
passing
the
housekeeper
parlour
that
a
jolly
good
licking
awaited
him
when
he
left
his
present
place
of
refuge
noaks
had
watched
his
opportunity
and
when
the
boys
were
at
tea
had
slipped
out
and
as
maxton
put
it
run
away
no
one
mourned
his
loss
even
mouler
would
not
own
to
having
been
his
friend
and
everybody
who
expressed
any
opinion
on
the
subject
spoke
of
his
departure
as
being
decidedly
a
good
riddance
the
triple
alliance
however
had
cause
to
feel
uneasy
when
they
heard
of
this
latest
escapade
of
their
ancient
enemy
he
got
my
knife
with
him
said
mugford
he
may
go
any
day
and
try
for
that
reward
for
the
time
being
however
no
communication
was
received
from
the
at
todderton
and
none
of
the
three
friends
was
caused
like
eugene
aram
to
leave
the
school
with
gyves
upon
his
wrists
whatever
evil
intentions
noaks
might
have
cherished
towards
them
were
destined
to
be
checkmated
by
a
fortunate
circumstance
the
possibility
of
which
neither
side
had
yet
foreseen
the
last
day
of
the
term
arrived
in
due
course
bringing
with
it
that
jolly
time
when
everybody
is
excited
happy
and
when
the
morning
work
is
a
mere
matter
of
form
and
the
boys
slap
their
books
together
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
with
the
joyful
conviction
that
the
whole
length
of
the
christmas
holidays
lies
between
them
and
next
lesson
directly
after
dinner
every
one
commenced
packing
up
which
term
might
have
been
supposed
to
include
every
form
of
skylarking
which
the
heart
of
the
small
boy
could
devise
from
racing
round
the
quadrangle
arrayed
in
one
of
bibbs
to
playing
football
in
the
gymnasium
north
south
with
the
remains
of
an
old
it
was
at
this
period
of
the
day
that
the
triple
alliance
proceeded
to
carry
out
a
project
which
had
for
some
little
time
occupied
the
minds
of
at
least
two
of
their
number
the
idea
was
that
the
little
fraternity
should
celebrate
their
approaching
separation
and
the
consequent
breaking
up
of
their
association
with
a
sort
of
funeral
feast
the
cost
of
which
jack
and
diggory
insisted
should
be
borne
by
the
two
surviving
members
only
one
outsider
was
invited
to
attend
namely
rats
whose
cheery
presence
it
was
thought
would
tend
to
enliven
the
proceedings
and
chase
away
the
gloomy
clouds
of
regret
which
would
naturally
hang
over
the
near
prospect
of
parting
the
where
such
functions
usually
took
place
being
at
this
time
in
a
state
of
indescribable
uproar
it
was
decided
that
the
banquet
should
be
served
in
one
of
the
remote
classrooms
none
of
the
fellows
come
near
it
said
jack
vance
and
if
old
watford
should
be
knocking
round
and
catch
us
there
he
wo
do
anything
we
shall
have
to
clear
out
that
all
accordingly
about
a
quarter
to
four
the
three
friends
with
their
solitary
guest
assembled
at
the
jack
vance
carried
two
big
paper
bags
diggory
a
and
a
small
tin
kettle
while
the
other
two
were
provided
with
four
clean
it
having
been
announced
that
there
was
going
to
be
some
cocoa
for
the
preparation
of
this
luxury
diggory
mounted
a
form
and
lit
one
of
the
over
which
he
and
jack
vance
took
it
in
turns
to
hold
the
kettle
until
the
water
boiled
sugar
cocoa
and
condensed
milk
were
produced
from
the
and
the
having
been
filled
with
the
steaming
beverage
the
company
seated
themselves
round
the
stove
in
which
there
still
smouldered
some
remains
of
the
morning
fire
and
prepared
to
enjoy
themselves
from
the
first
however
the
proceeding
fell
as
flat
as
even
the
gallant
efforts
of
rats
to
enliven
the
party
were
of
no
avail
and
for
some
time
everybody
munched
away
in
silence
jack
vance
occasionally
pausing
to
remark
here
pass
over
that
and
help
yourselves
the
classroom
itself
which
belonged
to
the
third
form
was
suggestive
of
that
glad
season
known
as
the
had
all
been
collected
and
stood
together
in
a
tray
on
the
master
table
fragments
of
examination
papers
filled
the
and
were
littered
here
and
there
about
the
floor
while
some
promising
latin
scholar
had
scrawled
across
the
blackboard
the
words
these
inspiriting
signs
of
a
good
time
coming
were
however
lost
on
the
triple
alliance
their
present
surroundings
served
only
to
remind
them
of
the
old
days
of
the
happy
family
when
they
had
first
come
to
ronleigh
never
expecting
but
to
have
completed
the
period
of
their
school
lives
in
one
another
company
well
said
jack
vance
suddenly
broaching
the
subject
which
was
uppermost
in
each
of
their
minds
we
had
jolly
times
remember
when
we
made
the
alliance
the
day
you
first
came
to
the
birches
diggory
yes
answered
diggory
it
was
just
after
we
been
frightened
by
the
ghost
remember
the
and
the
of
lords
and
the
philistines
i
wonder
what
become
of
them
all
one
reminiscence
suggested
another
and
after
exhausting
their
recollections
of
the
birches
they
recalled
their
varied
experiences
at
ronleigh
only
one
adventure
was
by
mutual
consent
not
alluded
to
their
clandestine
visit
to
the
hermitage
coupled
with
threat
hung
like
the
sword
suspended
by
a
single
hair
above
the
head
of
damocles
at
the
feast
at
length
when
the
paper
bags
had
been
wellnigh
emptied
jack
vance
intimated
his
intention
of
making
a
speech
which
announcement
was
received
with
considerable
applause
do
finish
up
your
cocoa
he
began
because
before
we
dissolve
the
alliance
i
going
to
propose
a
toast
we
been
friends
a
long
time
and
both
here
and
at
the
birches
as
diggory
says
the
triple
alliance
has
done
wonders
and
covered
itself
with
glory
cheers
we
said
when
we
started
that
we
always
stand
by
each
other
whatever
happened
and
so
we
have
and
so
we
would
again
if
we
were
going
to
be
together
any
longer
hear
hear
i
wish
could
have
joined
us
but
then
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
the
triple
alliance
however
now
it
finished
with
but
before
we
break
it
up
i
going
to
call
upon
you
to
drink
the
health
of
mugford
may
he
have
long
life
and
happiness
and
a
jolly
fine
house
with
a
model
railway
and
a
lake
for
boating
in
the
grounds
and
ask
us
all
to
come
and
stay
with
him
whenever
we
feel
inclined
this
sentiment
was
received
with
shouts
of
applause
and
in
honouring
it
the
were
drained
to
their
muddy
dregs
no
one
expected
that
mugford
would
reply
for
he
was
decidedly
a
man
of
few
words
but
on
this
occasion
he
rose
above
his
usual
self
and
sitting
with
his
hands
in
his
trouser
pockets
his
feet
on
the
fender
of
the
stove
and
his
chin
sunk
forward
on
his
breast
delivered
himself
as
follows
the
room
was
already
growing
dark
with
the
early
winter
twilight
which
perhaps
rendered
it
more
easy
for
him
to
undertake
the
task
of
responding
to
the
toast
you
always
been
very
kind
to
me
he
began
speaking
rather
quickly
no
we
have
interrupted
jack
vance
yes
you
have
just
shut
up
i
going
to
say
what
i
like
you
made
friends
with
me
because
i
happened
to
be
in
the
same
room
at
the
birches
but
you
always
stuck
to
me
and
helped
me
along
a
lot
when
we
came
here
first
i
know
i
stupid
and
sometimes
i
feel
i
a
coward
but
i
enjoyed
being
with
you
and
shall
always
remember
the
times
had
together
yes
i
swear
i
shall
always
and
now
i
got
a
drop
of
cocoa
left
so
i
going
to
propose
a
toast
you
must
take
in
my
place
i
hope
you
have
heaps
of
larks
and
you
must
write
me
a
letter
sometimes
and
tell
me
what
you
doing
here
goes
the
new
alliance
it
was
customary
to
laugh
at
whatever
mugford
said
but
on
this
occasion
not
even
a
smile
greeted
the
conclusion
of
his
remarks
only
diggory
spoke
no
we
sha
have
another
triple
alliance
now
it
going
to
end
he
turned
and
taking
something
out
of
the
said
solemnly
i
diggory
trevanock
do
hereby
declare
that
the
association
known
as
the
triple
alliance
is
now
dissolved
in
token
of
which
i
break
this
bit
of
a
flat
ruler
used
by
us
as
a
into
three
parts
one
of
which
i
present
to
each
of
the
members
as
a
keepsake
to
remind
them
of
all
our
great
deeds
and
many
adventures
each
boy
pocketed
his
fragment
of
wood
in
silence
jack
vance
tried
to
crack
a
joke
but
it
was
a
miserable
failure
there
was
something
i
wanted
to
say
began
rats
thoughtfully
i
shall
remember
it
in
a
minute
oh
what
up
why
i
know
what
it
was
mugford
talking
about
writing
to
him
reminded
me
of
it
i
awfully
sorry
but
there
were
some
letters
came
for
you
chaps
this
morning
i
took
them
off
the
table
meaning
to
give
them
to
you
but
i
quite
forgot
and
left
them
in
my
desk
well
you
a
nice
one
cried
diggory
suppose
you
go
and
fetch
now
rats
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
jack
vance
pulled
out
his
watch
and
held
it
down
so
that
the
glimmer
of
the
red
light
from
between
the
bars
of
the
stove
fell
upon
its
face
my
word
he
exclaimed
it
time
we
thought
about
packing
wait
a
jiff
for
those
letters
answered
diggory
a
moment
later
rats
came
scampering
down
the
passage
here
they
are
he
cried
i
very
sorry
i
forgot
a
letter
for
mugford
and
a
paper
for
vance
diggory
relighted
the
which
he
had
turned
out
after
boiling
the
kettle
and
proceeded
with
the
assistance
of
rats
to
gather
up
the
remains
of
the
feast
they
had
hardly
however
got
further
than
emptying
the
tin
kettle
down
the
ventilator
before
their
attention
was
attracted
by
a
joyful
exclamation
from
jack
vance
what
think
happened
he
cried
brandishing
the
open
newspaper
why
they
caught
the
thieves
who
stole
old
fossberry
coins
not
really
they
have
though
it
was
the
old
woman
who
looks
after
the
house
and
her
husband
they
to
be
tried
at
the
next
assizes
they
did
it
right
enough
some
of
the
coins
were
found
in
their
possession
and
hullo
what
the
matter
with
you
the
latter
remark
was
addressed
to
mugford
who
suddenly
jumped
on
a
form
began
to
dance
fell
off
into
the
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
capered
wildly
round
the
room
he
gone
mad
cried
diggory
catch
him
and
sit
on
his
head
no
i
have
exclaimed
mugford
coming
to
a
standstill
but
what
do
you
think
happened
guess
not
that
you
going
to
stay
on
here
yes
my
uncle
says
he
pay
for
me
and
i
to
come
back
again
after
christmas
well
i
sure
gasped
jack
vance
and
we
just
dissolved
the
alliance
we
must
make
it
again
no
you
sha
shouted
rats
diggory
said
you
would
i
coming
in
as
mugford
suggested
so
it
have
to
be
a
quadruple
one
next
time
well
so
it
shall
be
cried
jack
vance
embracing
mugford
with
the
hugging
power
of
a
juvenile
bear
next
term
we
start
afresh
diggory
and
rats
promptly
fell
into
each
other
arms
and
all
four
coming
into
violent
collision
tumbled
down
amidst
the
of
the
overturned
and
after
rolling
over
one
another
like
a
lot
of
young
dogs
scrambled
to
their
feet
turned
out
the
gas
and
rushed
away
to
complete
their
packing
so
as
the
door
slams
behind
them
they
vanish
from
our
sight
for
though
the
renewal
of
their
friendship
tempts
us
to
follow
them
further
in
their
school
life
we
are
reminded
that
our
story
has
been
told
here
ended
the
existence
of
the
triple
alliance
and
here
therefore
should
the
history
of
its
trials
and
triumphs
be
likewise
brought
to
a
conclusion
