school
society
and

chapter
i
leaving
home
one
pleasant
october
evening
arthur
hamilton
was
at
play
in
front
of
the
small
brown
cottage
in
which
he
lived
he
and
his
brother
james
were
having
a
great
frolic
with
a
large
spotted
dog
who
was
performing
a
great
variety
of
antics
such
as
only
dogs
understand
but
rover
had
been
carefully
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
making
a
bow
while
standing
on
his
hind
legs
tossing
pieces
of
bread
off
his
nose
putting
up
his
with
a
most
imploring
look
and
piteous
whine
which
the
boys
called
begging
for
money
and
when
a
chip
had
been
given
him
he
uttered
a
most
energetic
which
they
regarded
as
equivalent
to
thank
you
sir
and
walked
off
while
they
were
thus
amusing
themselves
their
mother
was
sitting
on
the
rude
piazza
which
ran
along
the
front
of
the
cottage
now
looking
at
the
merry
children
and
then
thoughtfully
gazing
at
the
long
shadows
which
were
stretching
across
the
road
hamilton
was
a
woman
of
wonderful
strength
and
energy
both
of
body
and
mind
and
she
had
been
sustained
for
many
years
by
the
christian
hope
but
there
was
now
a
heavy
burden
resting
on
her
soul
which
even
her
native
energy
and
christian
trust
were
unable
to
remove
she
had
known
many
days
of
worldly
prosperity
since
she
had
resided
in
that
little
cottage
but
of
late
trials
had
multiplied
and
days
and
nights
of
sorrow
had
been
appointed
unto
her
he
who
should
have
shared
life
trials
and
lightened
their
weight
had
proved
recreant
to
his
trust
and
was
now
wandering
she
knew
not
whither
and
poverty
was
staring
the
deserted
family
in
the
face
debts
had
accumulated
and
though
hamilton
had
done
all
that
could
be
done
to
meet
the
emergency
though
she
had
labored
incessantly
and
borne
fatigue
and
with
a
brave
and
cheerful
spirit
it
had
been
found
necessary
to
leave
the
home
so
dear
to
her
the
home
where
she
had
been
brought
a
fair
and
youthful
bride
where
she
had
spent
many
happy
years
and
which
was
endeared
to
her
by
so
many
sweet
and
hallowed
as
well
as
painful
associations
every
foot
of
the
green
meadow
the
orchard
on
the
hill
and
the
pasture
lying
beyond
was
dear
to
her
and
it
was
painful
to
see
them
pass
into
other
hands
but
that
heaviest
of
all
the
trials
which
poverty
brings
to
the
mother
heart
was
hers
also
the
conviction
had
been
forced
upon
her
that
she
must
separate
the
children
and
find
other
homes
for
such
as
were
old
enough
to
do
any
thing
for
themselves
this
necessary
separation
had
now
taken
place
her
eldest
son
had
gone
to
a
distant
southern
state
carrying
with
him
his
mother
prayers
and
blessings
and
a
strong
arm
and
stout
heart
with
which
to
win
himself
a
name
and
a
place
in
his
adopted
home
john
the
second
still
remained
with
her
assisting
by
his
unceasing
toil
to
earn
a
supply
for
their
daily
wants
henry
the
third
son
a
youth
of
sixteen
had
attracted
the
notice
of
his
pastor
and
by
his
advice
and
assistance
had
been
placed
on
the
list
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
american
education
society
and
was
now
at
an
academy
preparing
for
college
james
was
living
with
a
farmer
in
the
neighborhood
and
was
now
on
the
green
with
arthur
these
changes
had
already
taken
place
and
now
could
she
part
with
arthur
her
gentle
arthur
that
was
the
question
which
agitated
and
saddened
her
an
offer
had
been
made
her
by
martin
who
lived
in
an
adjoining
town
and
whom
she
knew
to
be
an
excellent
man
he
wished
to
take
arthur
and
keep
him
till
he
was
would
clothe
him
send
him
to
school
and
treat
him
as
one
of
his
own
family
training
him
to
habits
of
industry
and
economy
could
she
hope
any
thing
better
for
her
darling
boy
there
was
a
younger
brother
and
two
sisters
still
remaining
at
home
and
embarrassed
as
she
was
ought
she
not
to
be
grateful
for
such
an
opening
and
thankfully
avail
herself
of
it
such
was
the
view
another
might
take
of
the
subject
but
to
her
it
was
unspeakably
painful
to
think
of
the
separation
arthur
was
ten
years
old
but
he
was
a
modest
and
timid
boy
whose
sensitive
nature
had
led
him
to
cling
more
closely
to
his
side
than
his
bolder
and
more
active
brothers
hamilton
knew
that
this
was
no
time
for
the
indulgence
of
sentiment
she
knew
that
must
be
done
even
though
every
chord
of
her
heart
quivered
with
agony
after
much
consideration
and
earnest
prayer
she
had
concluded
to
let
him
go
and
the
thought
of
sending
him
away
from
her
and
all
he
loved
among
entire
strangers
was
what
made
her
so
sorrowful
she
strove
to
calm
herself
by
the
reflection
that
she
had
done
what
seemed
to
be
right
and
by
remembering
the
blessed
promises
of
god
holy
word
to
the
fatherless
and
to
all
those
who
put
their
trust
in
him
with
a
cheerful
voice
she
called
the
boys
telling
james
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
home
as
captain
with
whom
he
lived
was
a
very
particular
man
and
would
be
displeased
if
he
staid
out
beyond
the
proper
time
hamilton
sons
had
been
trained
to
obedience
and
james
never
thought
of
lingering
and
loitering
for
half
an
hour
as
i
have
seen
some
boys
do
after
being
told
to
go
he
just
gave
rover
a
good
pat
on
the
back
and
saying
a
hasty
to
his
mother
and
arthur
he
ran
home
arthur
was
alone
with
his
mother
and
she
told
him
of
the
arrangement
she
had
made
for
him
and
the
reasons
for
it
arthur
was
quite
overcome
at
the
idea
of
a
separation
from
the
mother
he
loved
so
dearly
and
exclaimed
oh
mother
do
send
me
away
from
home
i
can
earn
something
and
will
work
very
hard
if
you
will
only
let
me
stay
please
mother
let
me
stay
with
you
it
is
quite
as
painful
to
me
arthur
said
his
mother
to
part
from
you
as
it
can
be
to
you
but
i
think
it
is
best
for
you
and
i
am
sure
you
will
not
increase
my
trials
by
complaining
be
a
brave
boy
arthur
and
learn
to
submit
cheerfully
to
what
god
sends
upon
you
trust
in
him
and
he
will
bless
you
wherever
you
are
always
remember
he
watches
over
you
and
loves
you
i
think
and
martin
will
be
kind
to
you
and
i
hope
you
will
make
yourself
very
useful
to
them
they
are
quite
aged
and
a
pair
of
young
hands
and
feet
can
be
of
great
service
to
them
always
do
cheerfully
whatever
they
wish
of
you
even
if
not
quite
so
agreeable
at
the
moment
always
be
respectful
in
your
manners
to
them
and
to
all
others
with
whom
you
come
in
contact
and
try
to
make
them
happier
a
little
boy
may
do
a
good
deal
to
make
others
happy
or
unhappy
i
hope
you
will
try
to
do
what
is
right
at
all
times
and
i
doubt
not
you
will
be
contented
and
happy
there
after
you
become
accustomed
to
it
arthur
had
dried
his
tears
but
his
heart
was
heavy
as
he
laid
down
in
his
bed
that
night
and
when
he
was
alone
his
sobs
burst
forth
afresh
it
seemed
to
him
very
cruel
to
send
him
among
strange
people
and
he
thought
he
should
rather
go
without
much
to
eat
or
wear
than
to
leave
home
about
ten
days
after
john
carried
arthur
to
martin
hamilton
had
made
his
clothes
look
as
neat
and
tidy
as
possible
by
thoroughly
washing
and
mending
them
for
she
could
not
afford
to
get
any
new
ones
and
john
had
made
him
a
nice
box
in
which
they
were
all
carefully
placed
arthur
tried
to
be
a
brave
boy
as
his
mother
wished
but
he
could
not
eat
his
breakfast
that
morning
every
mouthful
seemed
to
choke
him
and
when
he
bade
his
mother
and
the
children
the
tears
would
come
fast
and
thick
into
his
eyes
in
spite
of
all
he
could
do
to
prevent
it
tears
were
in
his
mother
eyes
too
but
she
spoke
cheerfully
well
arthur
said
she
it
will
be
only
six
weeks
to
thanksgiving
and
martin
has
promised
you
shall
come
home
then
and
how
glad
we
shall
all
be
to
see
you
it
was
a
sunny
autumn
morning
the
white
frost
lay
on
the
grass
and
the
fences
and
the
was
chilly
as
the
boys
drove
on
rover
persisted
in
following
them
and
finally
arthur
begged
john
to
take
him
in
and
carry
him
over
rover
was
delighted
and
laid
himself
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
wagon
and
looked
affectionately
into
arthur
face
poor
rover
said
he
you
will
miss
me
i
know
and
i
shall
miss
you
a
great
deal
more
i
wonder
if
martin
has
a
dog
i
guess
not
said
john
for
he
took
no
notice
of
rover
and
every
body
who
likes
dogs
speaks
to
rover
because
he
is
so
large
and
handsome
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
homesick
at
first
over
there
but
we
must
do
the
best
we
can
for
these
are
hard
times
i
do
see
how
we
can
do
any
thing
more
than
pay
the
rent
this
year
after
all
my
work
for
the
dry
weather
ruined
the
potatoes
and
corn
wo
bring
more
than
fifty
cents
a
bushel
and
how
we
are
to
live
i
do
see
i
am
not
afraid
for
myself
but
it
is
too
bad
for
mother
and
the
little
ones
so
if
you
are
homesick
you
must
try
to
get
over
it
again
and
not
come
back
or
let
mother
know
it
for
she
has
just
as
much
trouble
as
she
can
bear
already
oh
no
said
arthur
i
wo
be
homesick
i
be
a
brave
boy
as
mother
calls
it
and
never
complain
let
what
will
come
but
i
do
wish
we
were
not
so
poor
i
do
know
said
john
i
think
poor
folks
that
work
hard
enjoy
about
as
much
as
anybody
after
all
it
is
a
disgrace
to
be
poor
if
we
are
only
honest
and
do
what
is
right
and
you
know
the
minister
said
last
sabbath
that
jesus
christ
when
he
lived
on
the
earth
was
a
poor
man
and
worked
with
his
hands
for
a
living
he
wo
despise
the
poor
now
he
has
gone
into
heaven
again
for
he
will
remember
how
he
was
poor
once
mother
says
nothing
will
break
her
heart
but
living
to
see
us
do
some
wicked
deed
and
that
she
could
not
survive
that
we
must
be
careful
not
to
break
her
heart
mus
we
arthur
so
the
lads
rode
on
till
noon
and
when
the
sun
shone
out
warmly
the
looked
more
magnificent
in
its
golden
light
than
king
solomon
in
all
his
glory
there
was
the
maple
and
the
yellow
beach
and
the
variegated
oak
mingled
with
the
fresh
green
hemlocks
and
pines
there
was
something
in
the
quiet
and
deep
stillness
of
the
woods
which
made
the
boys
silent
as
they
rode
through
they
felt
the
influence
of
its
exceeding
beauty
though
they
could
not
have
expressed
it
in
words
for
god
always
speaks
to
us
through
his
works
and
if
we
will
listen
to
the
voice
our
hearts
will
be
softened
and
pleasant
and
profitable
thoughts
will
arise
it
was
two
in
the
afternoon
when
john
and
arthur
reached
martin
he
was
not
at
home
but
martin
received
them
kindly
saying
she
expected
they
would
come
that
day
she
was
a
old
lady
who
wore
spectacles
and
the
inquisitive
manner
in
which
she
looked
over
the
top
of
them
into
arthur
face
quite
frightened
the
little
fellow
and
he
could
only
reply
in
very
low
monosyllables
to
the
questions
she
asked
him
so
john
gave
her
such
information
as
she
desired
martin
showed
them
the
small
chamber
in
which
arthur
was
to
sleep
and
john
carried
up
the
wooden
box
and
put
it
down
in
one
corner
after
staying
half
an
hour
john
thought
he
must
go
a
sense
of
the
loneliness
of
his
situation
among
strangers
where
no
one
familiar
voice
would
be
heard
and
not
one
familiar
object
seen
came
over
the
heart
of
poor
arthur
with
such
force
at
this
moment
that
he
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
exclaiming
oh
do
leave
me
here
john
do
leave
me
i
can
not
stay
brushing
the
tears
from
his
own
eyes
john
drew
the
sobbing
child
out
into
the
yard
saying
as
he
put
his
arms
affectionately
about
his
neck
but
arthur
what
do
you
think
mother
would
say
to
see
you
coming
back
with
me
how
it
would
distress
her
indeed
you
stay
and
try
to
be
contented
i
think
it
looks
like
a
pleasant
place
here
this
is
a
very
pretty
yard
and
yonder
is
a
large
garden
i
dare
say
martin
will
let
you
have
a
bed
in
it
next
spring
but
it
is
living
here
all
alone
which
i
dread
said
arthur
you
know
mother
says
we
are
never
all
alone
said
john
god
will
be
with
you
and
if
you
try
to
be
a
good
contented
boy
he
will
approve
of
your
conduct
and
love
you
only
six
weeks
too
remember
till
you
come
home
just
think
how
soon
they
will
be
gone
rover
had
been
gazing
wistfully
into
arthur
face
as
if
he
wondered
what
was
going
on
that
made
them
all
so
sober
and
now
he
gently
laid
his
paw
upon
his
hand
arthur
caressed
him
fondly
saying
oh
rover
dear
good
fellow
how
i
wish
i
could
have
you
for
company
i
wish
you
could
said
john
but
i
do
think
it
would
be
right
to
leave
him
for
martin
might
not
wish
to
have
him
john
now
untied
his
horse
saying
try
to
be
contented
for
mother
sake
dear
arthur
many
years
after
when
john
was
a
man
he
told
me
that
nothing
in
his
whole
life
had
made
him
feel
worse
than
leaving
little
arthur
behind
him
that
day
i
can
see
the
poor
little
fellow
now
said
he
just
as
he
looked
standing
at
the
gate
weeping
bitterly
rover
refused
at
first
to
leave
arthur
but
john
lifted
him
into
the
wagon
and
drove
off
it
was
a
lonely
evening
to
arthur
there
was
no
frolic
with
rover
and
the
children
on
the
green
no
kind
mother
voice
to
call
him
in
no
affectionate
kiss
for
the
little
stranger
and
martin
were
very
people
but
they
had
little
sympathy
with
a
child
and
made
no
conversation
with
him
there
was
no
hardship
imposed
on
arthur
indeed
they
required
less
of
him
than
he
had
been
accustomed
to
doing
at
home
and
had
he
been
a
courageous
boy
like
his
brother
james
he
would
soon
have
been
very
happy
in
his
new
home
but
we
have
said
he
was
shy
and
sensitive
like
a
delicate
plant
he
needed
sunshine
to
develope
his
nature
and
shrank
from
the
rough
chilling
blast
none
who
has
not
experienced
it
can
know
any
thing
of
the
suffering
such
a
child
endures
when
deprived
of
the
sweet
influences
of
home
such
an
one
often
appears
dull
and
stupid
to
a
careless
observer
when
there
is
throbbing
under
that
cold
exterior
a
heart
of
the
keenest
sensibility
let
the
bold
healthy
active
boy
be
sent
from
home
if
necessary
a
little
hardship
and
a
little
struggling
with
the
rougher
elements
of
life
will
perchance
but
strengthen
and
increase
his
courage
and
prepare
him
for
the
conflicts
and
struggles
of
after
years
but
oh
fond
mother
keep
that
delicate
timid
child
which
nestles
to
thy
side
with
such
confiding
trust
which
trembles
at
the
voice
of
a
stranger
and
shrinks
like
the
mimosa
from
a
rude
and
unfamiliar
touch
under
thine
own
sheltering
for
a
time
at
least
there
seek
to
develope
and
strengthen
his
delicate
nature
into
more
manly
strength
and
vigor
there
judiciously
repress
excessive
sensibility
and
increase
confidence
in
himself
and
others
if
it
can
possibly
be
avoided
do
not
expose
him
while
a
child
to
the
tender
mercies
of
those
who
do
not
understand
his
peculiar
temperament
and
who
however
kind
their
feelings
can
not
possess
his
confidence
we
need
not
dwell
on
the
first
weeks
of
arthur
stay
at
martin
they
thought
him
a
little
homesick
but
presumed
he
would
soon
get
over
it
he
performed
the
little
tasks
they
exacted
of
him
with
great
alacrity
and
was
quite
a
favorite
with
martin
who
said
he
was
the
most
quiet
and
child
she
ever
saw
at
first
arthur
thought
of
nothing
but
home
and
but
he
struggled
bravely
to
rise
above
sad
and
sorrowful
thoughts
and
to
be
contented
they
shall
never
hear
me
complain
he
said
to
himself
and
dear
mother
too
shall
never
know
how
bad
i
feel
i
want
to
do
my
duty
and
be
a
boy
every
fortnight
a
letter
came
from
home
and
though
arthur
read
it
with
streaming
eyes
it
was
a
precious
treasure
he
would
read
them
over
and
over
till
he
seemed
to
hear
his
mother
voice
once
more
and
feel
her
loving
hand
upon
his
head
he
answered
them
but
wrote
only
a
few
words
saying
he
was
well
and
the
other
common
place
remarks
children
usually
write
he
was
not
happy
but
he
was
calmer
now
and
did
not
night
cry
himself
to
sleep
the
visit
at
home
was
a
bright
cheering
spot
to
which
he
often
looked
forward
and
as
week
after
week
passed
away
slowly
indeed
he
rejoiced
in
the
certainty
that
that
period
was
getting
nearer
and
nearer
and
come
at
last
chapter
ii
thanksgiving
thanksgiving
dear
delightful
thanksgiving
what
a
happy
sound
in
all
childish
ears
what
visions
of
roast
turkeys
plum
puddings
and
pumpkin
pies
rise
before
us
at
the
name
what
hosts
of
rosy
cheeks
sparkling
eyes
little
heads
and
bounding
feet
what
blazing
fires
and
warm
parlors
what
large
stuffed
with
grandpapas
and
grandmamas
in
them
what
huge
bundles
of
flannel
out
of
which
plump
babies
roll
what
stuffed
hoods
and
cloaks
from
which
little
boys
and
girls
emerge
and
better
than
all
what
warm
hearts
brimming
with
affection
what
sweet
songs
of
joyful
praise
what
untold
depths
of
sacred
and
delight
belong
to
thee
dear
glad
let
us
look
in
at
hamilton
on
thanksgiving
eve
every
thing
in
her
little
is
just
as
clean
as
it
can
possibly
be
the
fire
burns
brightly
and
the
blaze
goes
dancing
and
leaping
merrily
up
the
chimney
diffusing
throughout
the
room
an
aspect
of
cheerfulness
henry
the
student
as
john
calls
him
is
at
home
for
of
course
it
is
vacation
in
his
school
and
his
mother
looks
with
pride
on
the
manly
form
and
handsome
face
of
this
her
favorite
boy
who
has
certainly
grown
taller
and
handsomer
since
his
last
visit
at
home
in
her
eyes
at
least
and
who
is
now
entertaining
himself
by
teaching
his
pet
emma
a
little
girl
of
four
to
repeat
the
greek
alphabet
and
whose
funny
pronunciation
of
alpha
beta
gamma
delta
is
received
with
peals
of
laughter
by
the
other
children
we
will
make
a
famous
greek
scholar
of
you
yet
said
harry
who
knows
darling
em
but
you
may
be
a
great
poetess
before
you
die
but
you
wo
be
a
blue
stocking
i
hope
my
stockings
are
said
the
unconscious
emma
mother
make
me
stockings
sticking
out
her
little
feet
by
way
of
confirming
the
fact
charlie
the
baby
as
he
is
called
now
almost
three
years
old
has
donned
his
new
red
flannel
dress
and
white
apron
in
honor
of
the
day
james
is
cracking
butternuts
in
one
corner
and
a
is
the
trophy
of
his
persevering
toil
lucy
the
eldest
sister
has
come
home
and
she
and
mary
are
deep
in
some
confidential
conversation
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
stopping
every
now
and
then
to
listen
as
if
expecting
to
hear
some
pleasant
sound
among
them
all
the
mother
moves
with
a
beaming
face
and
quiet
step
completing
the
arrangements
of
the
table
which
is
standing
at
the
backside
of
the
room
covered
by
a
snowy
cloth
and
decorated
with
the
best
plates
and
china
cups
and
saucers
the
relics
of
more
prosperous
days
hurra
they
come
they
come
said
james
tossing
down
his
hammer
and
bounding
over
the
pan
of
nuts
that
our
wagon
i
know
all
are
at
the
door
is
they
yes
is
john
and
arthur
our
dear
little
arthur
home
again
how
they
all
seize
upon
and
kiss
him
how
the
mother
holds
him
to
her
heart
with
tearful
eyes
ah
this
is
joy
such
joy
as
can
be
purchased
only
by
separation
and
suffering
who
that
looked
now
on
arthur
beaming
eye
and
glowing
cheek
could
dream
that
they
had
been
clouded
by
sorrow
or
dimmed
by
tears
of
all
the
happy
groups
that
were
assembled
in
our
old
commonwealth
that
night
few
we
think
were
happier
than
this
rover
was
by
no
means
a
silent
witness
of
the
joy
he
would
not
leave
arthur
side
a
moment
and
constantly
sought
to
attract
his
notice
arthur
had
been
always
very
fond
of
rover
almost
more
so
than
the
other
children
though
he
was
a
great
favorite
with
all
and
rover
had
missed
him
since
he
went
away
almost
as
much
as
arthur
had
missed
rover
so
it
was
a
joyful
on
both
sides
he
was
a
large
dog
of
the
newfoundland
breed
with
shaggy
hair
he
had
beautiful
white
spots
and
long
silky
ears
and
was
a
very
dog
he
would
let
charlie
get
on
his
back
and
ride
him
all
about
the
yard
and
the
boys
had
made
a
little
sled
to
which
they
fastened
rover
and
emma
well
wrapped
up
in
her
hood
and
cloak
with
her
woolen
mittens
on
would
have
quite
long
rides
after
him
sometimes
in
the
yard
and
sometimes
in
the
street
how
much
the
children
had
to
talk
about
that
night
how
many
stories
to
tell
arthur
and
questions
to
ask
him
in
return
arthur
had
decided
beforehand
not
to
make
any
complaint
or
to
say
he
was
unhappy
or
homesick
and
indeed
in
the
pleasure
of
being
at
home
again
he
almost
forgot
he
had
ever
been
unhappy
he
was
to
stay
till
monday
morning
and
to
him
those
four
days
seemed
a
long
period
of
enjoyment
quite
too
long
to
be
saddened
yet
by
the
thoughts
of
separation
the
night
settled
down
on
the
inmates
of
the
cottage
and
sweet
sleep
sealed
up
all
eyes
even
those
of
the
weary
mother
the
year
had
brought
many
trials
and
some
heavy
ones
but
there
was
in
spite
of
them
all
much
to
be
thankful
for
especially
that
all
her
beloved
children
had
been
preserved
to
her
and
were
so
healthy
so
promising
and
so
likely
to
prove
blessings
to
her
ah
how
long
afterwards
did
she
recall
that
merry
evening
and
those
beaming
faces
with
a
heavy
heart
chapter
iii
the
separation
thanksgiving
is
over
its
dinner
its
frolics
its
boisterous
mirth
are
all
in
the
past
it
is
sabbath
evening
a
sadness
seems
to
hang
about
the
party
lucy
had
returned
to
her
aunt
with
whom
she
lived
james
was
to
go
home
that
evening
henry
and
arthur
in
the
morning
they
with
john
and
their
mother
sat
thoughtfully
around
the
fire
the
younger
children
were
in
bed
little
was
said
by
any
one
but
hamilton
wishing
to
have
a
more
private
interview
with
arthur
took
him
to
her
room
there
she
questioned
him
about
his
new
home
more
particularly
to
her
amazement
the
moment
she
spoke
of
his
returning
he
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
poor
arthur
he
meant
to
be
brave
and
to
hide
his
troubles
but
now
that
his
heart
had
been
warmed
by
the
light
of
affection
and
the
idea
of
going
back
was
terrible
to
him
he
could
not
deceive
or
keep
back
any
thing
with
passionate
earnestness
he
besought
his
mother
to
let
him
stay
at
home
i
will
only
eat
a
potatoe
and
a
piece
of
bread
if
you
will
let
me
stay
mother
indeed
i
wo
be
much
of
a
burden
to
you
but
oh
dear
mother
do
send
me
back
there
cried
he
sobbing
as
if
his
heart
would
break
this
was
a
sad
trial
for
hamilton
and
she
paused
to
think
what
was
right
and
to
ask
for
guidance
from
on
high
it
seemed
to
her
that
arthur
dissatisfaction
arose
from
his
own
weakness
of
spirit
rather
than
from
anything
really
disagreeable
in
his
situation
they
were
kind
to
him
he
was
not
could
attend
a
good
school
and
would
it
not
be
an
injury
to
him
to
indulge
this
excessive
love
for
home
and
yield
to
his
entreaties
would
he
ever
be
a
man
with
courage
to
face
the
storms
of
life
if
she
with
a
woman
weakness
allowed
her
feelings
to
prevail
over
her
judgment
it
must
not
be
she
must
be
firm
for
his
sake
cruel
as
it
seemed
it
was
real
kindness
and
she
trusted
he
would
soon
be
contented
if
not
she
could
then
change
her
determination
if
she
wished
so
she
told
him
once
more
that
duty
and
not
present
enjoyment
was
to
be
consulted
that
she
still
thought
it
was
best
for
him
to
stay
at
martin
and
she
still
believed
he
would
find
contentment
and
peace
there
in
doing
his
duty
she
did
not
upbraid
him
but
told
him
very
tenderly
she
wished
him
to
acquire
more
strength
of
purpose
and
to
gain
the
habit
of
controlling
his
feelings
if
he
did
not
he
could
never
be
happy
or
useful
and
it
would
be
sad
indeed
to
grow
up
a
weak
timid
and
useless
being
who
had
not
strength
of
character
enough
to
pursue
what
was
right
if
difficulties
lay
in
the
path
whenever
you
are
lonely
and
sad
said
she
think
of
me
and
how
much
pleasure
you
are
giving
me
by
staying
and
doing
your
duty
think
of
your
father
in
heaven
who
watches
over
you
and
will
be
when
you
try
to
subdue
your
faults
never
forget
to
ask
him
for
strength
to
do
right
and
he
will
give
it
if
you
ask
in
sincerity
remember
always
that
he
has
placed
us
in
the
world
to
become
his
children
and
grow
holy
and
it
is
often
through
trial
we
are
made
better
you
will
be
a
better
boy
if
you
conquer
your
weakness
and
become
cheerful
and
contented
than
you
could
have
been
had
no
sacrifice
been
required
of
you
my
dear
child
i
do
believe
god
will
bless
you
and
enable
you
to
conquer
with
such
words
hamilton
sought
to
soothe
and
strengthen
her
child
while
her
own
heart
was
throbbing
with
painful
emotions
she
could
not
sleep
that
night
for
her
heart
yearned
over
her
darling
boy
and
she
longed
to
fold
him
under
the
shelter
of
a
loving
home
she
felt
that
she
needed
in
her
own
heart
more
of
that
perfect
submission
to
god
will
which
she
enjoined
on
others
and
it
was
only
by
earnest
and
humble
prayer
that
she
could
calm
her
troubled
spirit
and
feel
trust
and
confidence
that
all
was
for
the
best
but
she
had
found
prayer
to
be
a
balm
for
the
wounded
spirit
in
many
an
hour
of
suffering
and
she
now
realized
the
sweetness
of
that
inestimable
privilege
oh
not
a
gift
or
blessing
with
this
can
we
compare
the
power
which
he
hath
given
to
pour
our
souls
in
prayer
chapter
iv
the
present
arthur
left
home
early
monday
morning
it
was
a
cold
dreary
day
without
and
a
dreary
one
within
to
hamilton
she
had
no
unoccupied
moments
in
which
to
sit
down
and
pore
over
her
troubles
but
amid
all
her
cares
and
labors
the
pleading
sorrowful
face
of
her
boy
would
rise
before
her
like
an
accusing
angel
she
feared
she
had
shown
him
too
little
sympathy
in
his
sufferings
and
had
too
much
repressed
the
manifestation
of
his
feelings
she
seemed
to
herself
as
her
imagination
followed
her
weeping
boy
a
cruel
heartless
mother
and
again
only
in
prayer
could
she
find
relief
and
peace
and
even
then
a
weight
still
rested
upon
her
spirits
a
few
days
after
arthur
departure
an
idea
occurred
to
hamilton
which
she
was
sure
would
give
him
pleasure
this
was
to
send
him
rover
to
keep
as
his
own
but
would
the
children
be
willing
to
part
with
their
pet
and
playfellow
and
if
they
were
would
martin
give
his
consent
that
very
evening
she
proposed
it
to
the
children
and
she
was
pleased
to
find
how
willing
they
were
to
make
some
sacrifice
for
their
little
brother
sake
even
emma
who
loved
so
dearly
to
play
with
him
and
ride
on
the
sled
after
him
seemed
ready
to
part
with
him
when
she
found
it
would
make
arthur
happy
yet
it
was
with
a
mournful
voice
she
told
him
as
she
patted
him
and
stroked
his
long
ears
you
must
be
a
good
doggie
rover
and
make
my
brother
arthur
happy
he
be
good
brother
and
you
must
be
good
doggie
too
wo
you
rover
good
fellow
hamilton
wrote
to
martin
stating
arthur
fondness
for
the
dog
and
that
if
he
had
no
objections
they
should
like
to
give
him
to
arthur
for
his
own
but
added
that
she
did
not
wish
to
do
so
unless
perfectly
agreeable
to
him
she
was
quite
surprised
to
see
martin
coming
in
at
the
door
on
the
second
morning
after
the
letter
was
sent
he
said
he
had
come
within
three
miles
on
business
and
thought
he
would
just
ride
round
and
take
the
dog
i
fear
you
may
find
him
troublesome
sir
said
for
my
children
have
allowed
him
to
take
great
liberties
with
them
not
a
bit
not
a
bit
said
the
old
gentleman
to
be
sure
my
wife
do
take
to
dogs
overmuch
but
you
see
the
boy
is
a
little
and
we
want
him
to
feel
more
contented
if
we
can
so
i
was
very
glad
to
take
the
dog
he
is
a
noble
fellow
on
my
word
how
old
is
he
two
next
spring
said
and
he
is
a
very
kind
faithful
creature
i
assure
you
we
all
love
him
very
much
emma
and
charlie
who
had
just
comprehended
that
the
was
going
to
take
away
the
dog
began
to
look
very
grave
indeed
emma
was
no
martyr
to
suffer
calmly
for
conscience
sake
much
less
little
charlie
who
obstinately
asserted
with
a
most
heroic
air
that
nobody
should
tarry
off
doggie
but
your
dear
brother
arthur
is
all
alone
and
he
cries
at
night
when
he
goes
to
bed
because
he
has
no
brother
nor
sister
there
not
even
a
pussie
or
a
dog
he
wo
cry
if
rover
is
with
him
do
you
want
rover
to
go
esmaam
i
do
but
i
want
rover
to
stay
here
with
me
too
but
he
ca
make
arthur
happy
then
arthur
poor
dear
arthur
will
have
nobody
to
comfort
him
rover
go
said
emma
sorrowfully
but
i
wish
there
were
two
rovers
one
for
arthur
and
one
for
me
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
these
children
put
their
fat
little
arms
round
rover
neck
and
hug
him
over
and
over
again
and
kiss
his
rough
face
with
their
rosy
mouths
and
let
their
sunny
curls
lie
among
his
shaggy
locks
great
tears
rolled
down
emma
cheeks
as
the
dog
went
out
of
the
door
but
though
emma
was
no
martyr
she
was
a
generous
little
girl
and
she
did
not
want
to
keep
the
dog
away
from
arthur
though
so
sorry
to
part
with
it
we
have
got
you
and
i
and
two
kitties
have
we
charlie
said
she
and
sister
mary
and
brother
john
and
your
mother
beside
who
i
hope
is
worth
counting
said
hamilton
you
can
spare
rover
very
well
i
think
after
arthur
left
home
on
that
dark
cheerless
monday
morning
he
felt
very
sorry
indeed
that
he
had
made
any
complaint
to
his
mother
for
he
knew
that
by
doing
so
he
had
given
her
trouble
instead
of
being
a
comfort
and
help
to
her
in
the
midst
of
her
sorrows
besides
he
had
broken
his
resolution
for
he
had
most
firmly
resolved
not
to
complain
he
had
yielded
to
the
strong
impulse
of
the
moment
and
now
he
was
afraid
he
never
should
gain
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
make
stronger
efforts
to
be
contented
and
useful
in
his
new
home
he
humbly
asked
god
to
enable
him
to
do
better
and
to
pardon
the
weakness
of
the
past
whenever
a
little
boy
desires
with
his
whole
soul
to
do
right
and
prays
to
god
for
strength
he
will
certainly
find
he
can
however
difficult
it
may
seem
at
first
god
our
kind
heavenly
father
has
promised
to
give
us
his
holy
spirit
if
we
ask
him
for
it
in
sincerity
and
however
young
you
are
or
weak
or
ignorant
however
far
away
from
earthly
friends
or
human
sympathy
he
will
hear
the
softest
word
you
utter
the
faintest
breathing
of
a
silent
prayer
and
will
come
into
your
soul
and
bless
it
that
glorious
spirit
is
infinite
it
gives
life
to
the
archangel
hosts
it
blesses
the
weakest
and
lowliest
child
arthur
found
that
by
making
a
great
effort
a
great
one
he
could
restrain
his
tears
and
turn
his
thoughts
away
from
his
own
troubles
and
indeed
from
himself
entirely
he
had
a
few
books
and
he
became
fond
of
reading
them
sometimes
martin
would
ask
him
to
read
aloud
and
though
she
seldom
wished
to
hear
any
thing
but
newspapers
that
was
a
diversion
of
his
thoughts
arthur
had
a
clear
pleasant
voice
and
read
very
well
for
a
child
of
his
age
and
every
time
he
read
aloud
he
was
improving
himself
in
this
part
of
education
another
pleasant
change
was
going
to
school
arthur
had
dreaded
this
very
much
because
all
the
scholars
would
be
strangers
to
him
and
he
had
never
been
to
school
without
older
brothers
and
sisters
with
him
being
so
shy
and
timid
he
did
not
form
acquaintances
so
readily
as
some
boys
but
in
two
or
three
weeks
he
had
become
quite
friendly
with
some
particularly
theodore
roberts
theodore
was
two
years
older
than
arthur
but
recited
in
the
same
classes
he
passed
martin
on
his
way
to
school
and
usually
called
for
arthur
they
walked
about
half
a
mile
partly
through
a
wood
to
reach
the
a
little
brown
building
with
only
one
room
in
it
theodore
was
a
bold
boy
and
his
influence
over
arthur
was
very
good
while
arthur
gentler
nature
and
more
refined
manners
were
of
service
to
theodore
who
was
not
very
particular
about
little
things
one
night
as
theodore
and
arthur
were
coming
home
from
school
they
stopped
to
look
at
a
squirrel
nest
in
a
hollow
tree
just
in
the
wood
a
pretty
striped
squirrel
was
running
up
and
down
a
tree
at
a
little
distance
whisking
his
bushy
tail
and
watching
them
with
his
large
bright
eyes
they
found
a
large
store
of
nuts
in
the
hollow
tree
and
theodore
proposed
they
should
take
them
out
oh
no
no
said
arthur
would
you
have
the
poor
squirrel
starve
oh
he
find
enough
to
eat
never
fear
said
theodore
a
squirrel
is
too
cunning
to
starve
but
it
is
right
to
take
them
theodore
just
think
how
many
hours
the
little
fellow
worked
and
how
hard
he
tugged
to
get
them
all
in
here
and
they
are
now
i
sure
he
has
a
good
right
to
them
and
i
would
any
sooner
rob
him
of
his
nuts
than
i
would
a
man
of
his
money
la
what
a
fuss
you
make
about
it
said
theodore
with
a
loud
laugh
but
since
you
feel
so
bad
i
let
his
squirrelship
alone
this
time
thank
you
said
arthur
and
now
theodore
i
must
say
if
you
had
done
it
i
would
have
liked
to
play
with
you
so
well
as
i
did
before
for
i
should
think
you
were
a
cruel
boy
and
i
could
love
you
you
are
a
curious
fellow
said
theodore
with
another
loud
laugh
such
lessons
were
not
lost
on
theodore
for
though
he
had
had
very
little
instruction
in
morals
or
manners
he
had
a
heart
in
the
right
place
under
his
rough
outside
we
begin
our
stone
house
if
you
come
in
theodore
said
arthur
as
they
reached
martin
gate
no
i
ca
stop
sister
susan
is
coming
to
see
us
and
i
want
to
get
home
early
this
made
arthur
think
of
sisters
and
it
was
with
rather
a
heavy
heart
he
entered
the
yard
martin
stood
near
the
door
and
as
arthur
passed
him
he
said
i
have
got
a
present
in
the
house
for
you
a
present
for
sir
said
arthur
yes
for
you
and
something
you
like
too
i
guess
what
do
you
think
it
is
rover
who
knew
the
sound
of
arthur
voice
began
to
bark
loudly
and
in
a
moment
the
door
was
opened
and
he
was
in
arms
never
was
there
a
more
joyful
meeting
between
old
friends
arthur
was
so
excited
that
he
laughed
and
cried
at
once
and
said
all
kinds
of
wild
things
to
rover
who
in
his
turn
kept
caressing
his
young
master
and
telling
him
in
his
way
how
glad
he
was
to
see
him
again
and
indeed
the
poor
dumb
animal
seemed
to
express
as
much
affection
and
delight
as
if
he
had
had
a
tongue
to
say
in
words
how
much
he
loved
him
how
do
you
like
your
present
my
boy
said
martin
arthur
could
hardly
speak
for
emotion
but
in
a
moment
he
replied
very
much
indeed
sir
and
you
are
very
good
to
get
him
for
me
but
may
he
stay
here
with
me
yes
he
is
your
dog
now
arthur
they
have
given
him
to
you
at
home
they
seem
to
set
a
great
deal
by
him
too
there
arthur
well
knew
how
dearly
they
all
loved
rover
and
he
felt
sure
it
must
have
been
hard
for
them
to
give
him
up
his
heart
was
touched
by
this
generosity
and
he
resolved
to
become
worthy
of
it
and
to
strive
to
do
something
to
make
the
family
happy
in
return
rover
seemed
to
impart
new
life
to
arthur
he
had
now
something
to
love
and
something
that
loved
him
and
though
it
was
only
a
poor
dumb
animal
it
filled
the
vacant
place
in
his
heart
never
had
martin
seen
his
dark
eyes
sparkle
so
and
his
pale
cheek
look
so
bright
and
did
the
children
at
home
regret
making
this
sacrifice
for
their
little
brother
sake
if
any
little
reader
asks
this
question
we
fear
they
have
never
tried
the
experiment
of
giving
up
something
they
loved
to
make
another
happy
if
they
had
they
would
know
what
great
delight
there
was
in
it
what
a
warm
delicious
feeling
it
spreads
throughout
the
heart
it
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
and
happy
as
arthur
was
in
receiving
this
precious
present
they
were
still
happier
in
having
given
it
as
hamilton
was
undressing
emma
that
night
the
latter
said
mother
do
you
think
arthur
has
got
rover
yet
oh
yes
some
hours
ago
i
hope
i
dare
say
he
found
him
there
when
he
got
home
from
school
and
how
happy
he
is
dear
child
i
can
see
just
how
bright
and
happy
he
looks
as
he
strokes
rover
and
talks
to
him
oh
i
am
glad
he
is
gone
mother
for
this
dear
brother
was
all
alone
so
i
glad
echoed
charlie
who
was
snugly
tucked
into
the
yes
said
their
mother
kissing
them
both
it
always
makes
us
glad
when
we
have
made
another
happy
and
i
am
glad
you
have
had
an
opportunity
of
learning
early
how
pleasant
it
is
to
make
sacrifices
for
others
the
darkest
lot
is
not
all
gloom
thought
she
as
she
sat
down
by
her
little
table
and
began
to
sew
poverty
can
teach
many
sweet
lessons
and
give
us
many
rich
enjoyments
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
they
were
sweet
refreshing
tears
chapter
brighter
days
arthur
was
never
lonely
now
for
rover
was
constantly
at
his
side
except
in
school
and
he
always
went
to
the
door
with
him
in
the
morning
and
often
when
arthur
came
out
of
school
at
night
he
would
find
rover
standing
by
the
door
waiting
for
him
a
happy
dog
was
rover
in
his
new
home
martin
fed
him
with
her
own
hand
and
many
a
nice
dainty
did
he
get
which
he
was
not
accustomed
to
arthur
was
such
a
obliging
boy
so
ready
to
obey
her
and
had
such
gentle
respectful
manners
that
the
good
old
lady
was
glad
to
make
rover
happy
for
his
sake
obliging
little
boys
almost
always
find
that
those
they
live
with
are
obliging
too
while
quarrelsome
boys
usually
find
it
their
fortune
to
fall
among
quarrelsome
companions
for
good
temper
and
bad
temper
are
both
contagious
and
infect
all
those
who
come
in
contact
with
them
on
bright
cold
winter
mornings
after
eating
his
nice
breakfast
rover
would
scamper
off
to
school
with
arthur
he
was
in
too
fine
spirits
to
walk
by
his
side
so
he
would
bound
off
before
him
plunging
into
the
snow
drifts
up
to
his
neck
then
bound
back
again
with
a
short
quick
bark
shaking
himself
from
the
feathery
snow
and
away
again
for
another
merry
race
if
he
was
separated
for
an
hour
from
arthur
he
would
leap
up
at
his
return
and
almost
overwhelm
him
with
his
rough
embraces
but
this
seldom
happened
out
of
school
hours
for
let
arthur
go
where
he
would
to
the
barn
the
brook
of
an
errand
or
on
a
visit
to
his
friend
theodore
there
rover
was
sure
to
follow
arthur
would
sometimes
take
him
into
his
room
at
night
and
let
him
lie
there
but
martin
did
not
approve
of
this
but
as
she
was
always
up
by
she
would
open
the
door
and
rover
would
go
scampering
up
the
stairs
ready
for
a
great
frolic
on
arthur
bed
as
the
school
continued
arthur
became
attached
to
his
teacher
and
was
quite
a
favorite
with
his
schoolmates
arthur
hamilton
he
was
always
called
by
them
not
because
there
were
not
many
other
boys
smaller
than
he
but
from
his
gentleness
and
timid
softness
he
seemed
one
to
be
protected
by
them
and
the
roughest
boy
never
thought
of
pushing
and
striking
arthur
made
a
visit
of
two
days
at
home
in
the
spring
vacation
his
mother
heart
was
cheered
by
the
visible
improvement
in
her
boy
and
she
told
him
he
had
done
much
to
make
her
happy
by
rising
above
his
weakness
and
gaining
the
victory
over
his
besetting
sin
nothing
she
told
him
could
ever
grieve
his
mother
heart
like
seeing
her
children
do
wrong
nothing
ever
make
her
so
happy
as
their
doing
right
henry
was
still
at
the
academy
hoping
to
enter
college
the
ensuing
commencement
lucy
with
her
aunt
and
james
at
captain
l
arthur
did
not
see
them
but
he
had
a
pleasant
visit
with
the
rest
he
went
to
all
his
favorite
places
of
resort
the
orchard
the
old
pasture
and
the
little
brook
in
the
meadow
he
led
charlie
in
one
hand
and
emma
in
the
other
out
on
the
green
grass
in
the
lot
and
picked
for
them
the
pretty
which
were
springing
up
everywhere
among
it
while
rover
ran
along
by
their
side
or
bounded
off
in
a
merry
frolic
they
were
all
glad
to
see
rover
once
more
and
never
was
a
dog
so
petted
and
caressed
as
he
was
on
this
visit
to
his
old
friends
when
arthur
returned
home
he
found
that
the
spring
had
brought
a
variety
of
labors
with
it
martin
was
a
farmer
and
there
were
many
things
to
do
suited
to
his
age
and
strength
he
did
all
that
was
required
of
him
with
alacrity
but
he
often
found
at
night
that
his
limbs
were
very
weary
when
he
lay
down
in
bed
martin
soon
found
he
could
not
endure
so
much
as
most
boys
of
his
age
but
said
he
to
his
wife
work
will
do
him
good
and
make
him
hearty
a
woman
never
can
bring
up
a
boy
properly
hamilton
also
hoped
that
exercise
in
the
open
air
would
give
tone
and
vigor
to
his
somewhat
delicate
system
and
develope
his
slender
frame
into
manly
strength
and
symmetry
she
wished
nothing
better
for
her
sons
than
to
become
intelligent
industrious
and
honest
farmers
and
such
with
god
blessing
she
hoped
arthur
would
in
time
be
chapter
vi
sad
news
it
was
a
hot
saturday
in
august
when
henry
hamilton
left
school
to
go
home
and
spend
the
sabbath
with
his
mother
this
he
frequently
did
as
it
was
but
ten
miles
distant
and
such
a
walk
was
only
pastime
to
the
vigorous
youth
now
glowing
with
health
and
strength
in
every
vein
on
this
day
however
the
walk
appeared
unusually
long
to
him
and
he
sat
down
twice
by
the
to
rest
himself
this
was
very
uncommon
but
he
said
nothing
of
fatigue
when
he
reached
home
about
sunset
he
met
them
with
his
usual
cheerful
smile
and
had
a
laugh
and
pleasant
words
for
the
children
as
they
crowded
round
him
of
all
children
henry
was
the
most
sanguine
and
and
when
at
home
he
was
always
the
life
of
the
family
circle
he
was
sincerely
desirous
of
gaining
a
thorough
education
and
of
doing
credit
to
his
patrons
and
friends
and
he
hoped
to
be
permitted
to
accomplish
much
good
in
the
world
when
he
had
acquired
his
profession
there
was
much
enthusiasm
in
his
character
and
much
of
generous
impulse
yet
they
were
modified
by
christian
principle
henry
was
a
sincere
christian
there
was
little
of
noisy
pretension
or
loud
profession
but
in
his
soul
was
a
deep
and
abiding
sense
of
obligation
to
god
a
supreme
desire
to
do
his
will
and
a
fervent
love
to
his
to
a
remarkably
fine
person
was
added
an
intellect
of
uncommon
quickness
and
discrimination
and
his
teachers
spoke
in
high
commendation
of
his
progress
we
have
said
he
was
the
favorite
son
of
his
mother
and
if
a
thrill
of
pride
passed
through
her
heart
as
she
gazed
on
his
beaming
face
if
she
garnered
up
in
her
inmost
soul
many
precious
dreams
of
a
brilliant
future
who
can
wonder
who
shall
blame
her
it
is
now
many
years
since
the
dust
fell
on
that
sunny
brow
but
i
well
remember
henry
hamilton
handsome
henry
hamilton
and
seldom
indeed
since
have
i
seen
a
more
striking
form
and
face
there
was
a
frank
joyous
expression
beaming
forth
from
his
dark
eyes
and
his
mouth
had
always
a
sweet
smile
playing
about
it
there
was
a
high
intellectual
forehead
indicating
thought
though
it
was
half
hidden
by
the
sunny
brown
curls
which
clustered
about
it
and
gave
a
youthful
look
to
even
this
portion
of
his
face
his
tall
figure
was
the
perfection
of
manly
symmetry
and
his
musical
laugh
was
ever
ringing
out
freely
and
unconsciously
his
temperament
was
just
the
reverse
of
arthur
bold
courageous
he
hoped
all
things
and
feared
nothing
that
man
could
do
by
nature
too
he
was
quick
and
passionate
yet
full
of
affection
and
all
generous
impulses
such
was
henry
hamilton
now
eighteen
years
of
age
the
pride
of
his
family
the
favorite
of
all
who
knew
him
the
night
of
his
return
home
he
became
violently
ill
and
no
remedies
appeared
to
relieve
his
sufferings
i
will
not
pain
my
young
readers
with
a
recital
of
his
agonies
they
were
most
intense
and
on
the
third
day
after
he
was
attacked
at
six
in
the
afternoon
he
went
from
an
earthly
to
a
heavenly
home
from
the
bosom
of
his
mother
to
the
bosom
of
his
god
there
were
few
intervals
of
sufficient
ease
to
allow
of
conversation
during
these
he
expressed
entire
confidence
in
the
saviour
and
perfect
submission
to
the
will
of
god
though
death
then
was
most
unexpected
to
him
he
also
expressed
regret
that
he
had
done
so
little
for
god
and
besought
a
friend
who
stood
by
his
bedside
to
be
faithful
to
his
christian
vows
the
last
struggle
was
a
fearful
one
but
his
mother
supported
him
in
her
arms
to
the
last
and
to
her
his
last
look
was
given
a
look
of
sweet
affection
trust
and
gratitude
i
stood
beside
his
dead
body
an
hour
after
the
spirit
had
left
it
i
had
never
before
and
have
never
since
seen
one
so
beautiful
in
death
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
streamed
softly
in
at
an
open
window
and
one
sweet
ray
fell
upon
his
head
it
was
a
bright
halo
a
glorious
crown
for
that
sleeping
dust
to
wear
the
fair
wide
brow
the
rich
dark
curls
the
eyelids
the
beautiful
mouth
had
never
been
so
lovely
all
was
radiant
there
was
an
expression
of
heavenly
joy
i
have
never
seen
in
a
sleeper
since
i
had
not
seen
him
in
his
mortal
agony
and
now
it
seemed
impossible
he
could
have
ever
suffered
can
this
be
death
thought
i
ah
there
is
a
stillness
too
deep
for
life
those
closed
lips
do
not
move
those
eyes
do
not
open
there
is
no
lingering
breath
no
beating
heart
it
is
only
dust
the
spirit
fled
beautiful
sleeper
there
shall
be
no
waking
of
thy
precious
dust
till
the
resurrection
morning
others
came
in
and
i
left
the
room
reluctantly
for
it
was
pleasant
to
me
to
be
near
one
i
had
loved
in
life
i
went
into
the
several
neighbors
were
moving
about
but
the
mother
was
not
there
i
found
her
in
the
piazza
she
was
calm
but
oh
who
could
fathom
the
depths
of
her
anguish
who
but
he
who
formed
the
soul
with
all
its
mysterious
capacities
for
suffering
the
red
light
lay
on
the
western
hills
and
they
were
very
beautiful
in
their
summer
greenness
stretching
along
the
horizon
in
wavy
outlines
the
summer
sky
above
was
beautiful
and
so
were
the
quiet
fields
and
the
ancient
trees
standing
breathlessly
silent
in
that
glorious
twilight
rays
of
heaven
were
blending
with
all
that
was
loveliest
on
earth
but
though
the
mother
eye
was
fixed
upon
the
scene
it
was
evident
she
did
not
see
it
nor
feel
its
healing
power
what
wonder
the
agony
was
too
recent
the
blighting
of
all
her
hopes
too
sudden
for
resignation
and
peace
to
come
into
her
soul
at
once
the
heavy
blow
had
fallen
and
her
heart
was
crushed
no
tear
was
in
her
eye
no
trembling
in
her
voice
as
she
replied
to
questions
but
a
face
more
expressive
of
utter
woe
i
have
seldom
seen
what
word
of
consolation
could
a
mortal
speak
at
such
an
hour
the
heart
knoweth
its
own
bitterness
and
a
stranger
may
not
with
its
griefs
let
it
be
alone
with
god
james
was
sent
the
next
morning
to
bear
the
heavy
tidings
to
arthur
and
to
bring
him
home
to
see
the
precious
dust
committed
to
its
kindred
dust
arthur
was
stunned
by
the
suddenness
of
the
blow
he
rode
back
with
james
scarcely
speaking
a
word
he
could
not
feel
that
henry
was
it
seemed
like
some
fearful
dream
from
which
he
must
rouse
himself
but
when
he
saw
his
mother
and
felt
himself
pressed
in
speechless
agony
to
her
heart
his
tears
burst
forth
in
torrents
childhood
can
weep
over
its
sorrows
it
is
only
later
griefs
that
refuse
the
healing
balm
of
tears
chapter
vii
the
gathering
it
was
thought
best
to
lay
henry
beloved
form
in
the
earth
on
the
day
following
his
death
it
was
one
of
those
intensely
warm
sultry
days
august
often
brings
not
a
leaf
stirred
upon
the
trees
not
a
cloud
dimmed
the
sky
one
by
one
neighbors
and
friends
dropped
in
with
noiseless
step
hushed
voices
and
stifled
sobs
alone
were
heard
in
the
house
of
death
many
very
many
had
loved
henry
and
many
looked
with
tearful
eyes
on
his
peaceful
form
the
glow
had
passed
away
from
his
sweet
face
the
marks
of
the
destroying
angel
were
more
clearly
visible
but
there
was
a
soft
repose
still
beautiful
to
look
upon
diffused
over
every
feature
aged
men
and
women
who
had
known
him
from
a
child
sobbed
as
they
gazed
on
one
so
young
so
gifted
snatched
away
from
life
the
pastor
who
had
baptized
him
when
an
infant
and
one
from
the
adjoining
town
were
there
both
had
known
henry
and
both
had
loved
him
both
spoke
with
tearful
eyes
and
quivering
lip
of
his
worth
and
loveliness
holy
words
of
prayer
were
spoken
the
bereaved
mother
and
weeping
children
were
commended
to
god
the
only
refuge
in
this
hour
of
darkness
and
fervent
intercessions
were
offered
united
with
grateful
thanksgivings
for
all
that
had
been
enjoyed
in
the
past
and
for
all
the
cheering
hopes
which
brightened
the
future
the
hymn
why
should
we
mourn
departing
friends
or
shake
at
death
alarms
was
read
and
sung
once
more
the
children
were
all
together
under
the
roof
where
they
had
often
met
all
save
the
son
whose
home
was
now
in
a
sunnier
clime
but
how
unlike
was
this
to
their
last
joyful
gathering
hours
of
rejoicing
and
hours
of
mourning
ye
are
strangely
blended
in
the
experience
of
human
hearts
the
little
village
was
not
far
distant
a
grave
was
opened
there
for
him
who
but
one
short
week
ago
was
as
full
of
life
of
bounding
vigor
and
of
high
hopes
as
the
strongest
there
oh
had
it
been
but
told
you
then
to
mark
whose
lamp
was
dim
from
out
the
ranks
of
these
young
men
would
ye
have
singled
whose
was
the
sinewy
arm
that
flung
defiance
to
the
ring
whose
shout
of
victory
loudest
rung
yet
not
for
glorying
whose
heart
in
generous
thought
and
deed
no
rivalry
could
brook
and
yet
distinction
claiming
not
there
lies
he
go
and
look
tread
lightly
comrades
we
have
laid
his
dark
locks
on
his
brow
like
life
save
deeper
light
and
shade
we
not
disturb
them
now
of
all
who
stood
by
that
open
grave
none
wept
so
passionately
as
little
arthur
he
could
not
control
his
emotions
and
it
was
in
vain
that
friends
tried
to
soothe
him
poor
child
did
a
sad
presentiment
of
coming
evil
pass
over
his
soul
slowly
and
sadly
they
laid
him
down
and
slowly
and
sadly
they
returned
home
that
home
now
so
vacant
so
desolate
there
let
us
leave
them
sorrowing
but
not
sorrowing
as
those
without
hope
it
is
on
just
such
scenes
as
these
that
the
light
of
christian
faith
shines
with
a
pure
and
holy
radiance
cheering
the
bereaved
heart
and
speaking
sweet
words
of
reunion
of
immortality
of
glory
which
fadeth
not
away
chapter
viii
more
trials
the
next
day
arthur
returned
to
martin
his
affectionate
heart
was
saddened
and
every
pleasure
seemed
to
have
lost
its
charm
but
the
griefs
of
childhood
quickly
pass
away
and
arthur
in
a
few
days
became
calm
and
cheerful
a
close
observer
however
might
have
seen
a
deeper
shade
of
thoughtfulness
in
his
eyes
and
a
softer
tone
in
his
always
gentle
voice
he
went
to
school
again
and
mingled
in
his
quiet
way
with
the
sports
of
his
companions
theodore
could
not
be
spared
from
to
attend
school
in
the
summer
months
and
arthur
saw
much
less
of
him
than
formerly
they
would
meet
occasionally
after
tea
and
with
rover
by
their
side
stroll
down
by
the
stream
which
wound
in
fanciful
little
curves
about
the
lot
or
would
play
at
ball
on
the
green
before
the
house
arthur
seemed
less
inclined
than
usual
for
noisy
sports
and
theodore
sometimes
thought
he
was
a
sad
stupid
playfellow
one
evening
about
five
weeks
after
henry
funeral
martin
said
to
her
husband
it
seems
to
me
arthur
is
not
well
he
has
complained
a
great
deal
of
his
head
and
his
face
looks
flushed
and
feverish
i
have
noticed
him
replied
martin
but
he
certainly
is
not
a
healthy
boy
and
i
am
afraid
never
will
be
the
next
morning
arthur
refused
to
eat
and
before
night
a
burning
fever
had
evidently
seized
upon
him
a
physician
was
called
who
said
at
once
he
is
a
very
sick
child
his
head
is
so
hot
i
fear
a
brain
fever
you
had
better
send
for
his
mother
for
mothers
i
find
are
generally
the
best
nurses
he
a
fine
little
fellow
and
we
must
try
to
save
him
martin
went
himself
for
hamilton
the
next
morning
it
was
indeed
heavy
tidings
that
he
bore
was
god
about
to
strip
her
of
all
she
loved
her
little
arthur
was
a
precious
child
and
must
he
be
taken
too
but
she
quietly
prepared
to
go
to
him
that
was
manifestly
her
first
duty
there
was
no
time
for
the
indulgence
of
grief
though
heavy
forebodings
weighed
upon
her
heart
when
hamilton
reached
the
bedside
of
her
child
she
found
him
delirious
and
was
shocked
to
see
he
did
not
know
her
he
was
much
sicker
than
she
expected
to
find
him
and
her
heart
sunk
within
her
is
there
no
hope
doctor
she
asked
with
a
quivering
lip
certainly
there
is
a
chance
for
a
boy
of
his
age
but
he
is
a
very
sick
child
hamilton
twill
be
a
hard
struggle
for
life
and
it
is
impossible
to
tell
what
will
be
the
result
day
after
day
night
after
night
the
mother
bent
over
the
of
her
child
her
heart
sickening
with
alternations
of
hope
and
fear
sometimes
the
pulse
would
lessen
and
the
medicine
seem
to
affect
him
favorably
and
she
would
hope
her
prayers
had
been
heard
and
that
life
and
not
death
was
to
be
his
fate
then
the
fever
would
rage
with
renewed
violence
and
his
little
frame
would
be
convulsed
with
pain
at
no
time
did
he
appear
to
know
who
was
with
him
or
have
the
slightest
gleam
of
consciousness
he
talked
but
little
and
that
incoherently
like
one
in
a
dream
those
were
long
sad
hours
to
the
anxious
mother
heart
how
i
lived
through
those
days
and
weeks
of
anguish
i
know
not
she
afterwards
said
but
strength
was
given
me
according
to
the
day
and
where
was
rover
faithful
affectionate
rover
in
these
mournful
days
the
poor
animal
moaned
and
howled
perpetually
he
would
it
through
the
whole
day
and
night
upon
the
stairs
leading
to
arthur
room
endeavoring
to
gain
admittance
and
when
driven
away
would
contrive
to
return
to
his
post
watching
with
intense
eagerness
those
who
entered
or
left
the
room
continually
making
that
dismal
moaning
which
a
dog
in
distress
usually
does
it
was
heartrending
to
hear
him
one
day
they
allowed
him
to
enter
the
room
hoping
it
might
quiet
him
he
jumped
upon
the
bed
instantly
and
disturbed
the
suffering
child
so
much
that
he
was
never
permitted
to
go
in
again
poor
arthur
he
no
longer
had
a
smile
or
caress
even
for
rover
the
companion
of
his
lonely
hours
the
sharer
of
his
exile
he
did
not
even
notice
him
except
by
raising
his
hand
to
keep
him
off
after
three
weeks
of
severe
suffering
a
change
came
over
the
beloved
child
the
physician
thought
it
barely
possible
that
such
a
crisis
might
terminate
favorably
and
had
prescribed
powerful
stimulants
but
it
was
soon
evident
that
he
was
rapidly
sinking
in
spite
of
them
he
suffered
no
longer
but
the
shadows
of
the
grave
were
gathering
upon
his
face
and
it
was
not
probable
he
would
survive
till
morning
but
hamilton
did
not
wish
any
one
to
sit
up
by
his
bedside
except
herself
they
were
wearied
she
said
by
watching
she
should
not
sleep
if
others
watched
and
if
any
thing
was
needed
she
would
call
them
so
she
passed
the
night
alone
with
her
sweet
boy
in
after
years
i
have
often
heard
her
speak
of
it
it
was
one
of
those
glorious
moonlight
october
nights
the
loveliest
of
landscapes
lay
before
her
eye
as
she
stood
by
the
window
and
gazed
out
upon
the
scene
green
hills
with
intersecting
valleys
forest
trees
lifting
their
tops
toward
the
sky
pasture
lands
and
threading
its
way
among
them
a
little
bright
and
pure
as
innocence
itself
all
these
were
visible
and
over
all
lay
that
holy
moonlight
bathing
each
object
in
its
spiritual
radiance
who
would
imagine
to
look
on
the
earth
on
such
a
night
that
it
could
be
filled
with
sin
and
suffering
that
those
glorious
skies
bent
over
breaking
hearts
and
opening
graves
the
scene
was
full
of
calming
influences
and
the
heart
of
the
mother
as
she
gazed
was
soothed
and
elevated
she
felt
the
presence
of
god
who
had
made
the
universe
and
she
knew
that
while
he
guided
those
glorious
orbs
in
their
courses
he
also
felt
compassion
and
love
for
her
poor
suffering
heart
had
afflicted
her
and
he
in
his
infinite
power
and
love
knew
so
much
better
than
she
what
was
best
and
good
that
it
was
pleasant
to
commit
all
her
interests
into
his
hands
her
older
son
her
bright
beloved
boy
had
gone
she
believed
to
mingle
his
songs
in
a
purer
worship
than
that
of
earth
and
would
she
call
him
back
from
glory
as
she
lifted
her
eyes
up
to
the
serene
heavens
she
almost
fancied
she
heard
his
voice
saying
he
doeth
all
things
well
do
not
fear
to
trust
him
and
when
she
returned
to
her
dying
child
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
sweet
confidence
i
will
not
fear
to
trust
him
even
with
this
darling
child
his
gentle
spirit
was
not
fitted
for
earthly
strifes
now
it
shall
expand
in
an
atmosphere
of
perfect
love
lord
gave
him
the
lord
taketh
him
away
blessed
be
his
name
the
dying
boy
breathed
gently
and
looked
as
if
in
a
sweet
sleep
sometimes
a
smile
would
play
around
his
mouth
as
if
he
were
in
a
pleasant
dream
there
was
no
perceptible
change
till
nearly
morning
then
hamilton
called
and
martin
they
stood
in
tearful
silence
round
his
bed
for
they
loved
arthur
almost
as
a
child
watching
his
shortened
breathing
there
was
no
pain
no
sigh
but
as
the
morning
light
gleamed
across
the
eastern
hill
the
spirit
passed
away

by

coffin

upon

table
and
aged
men
and
women
and
and
children
looked
into
it
with
weeping
eyes

stifled
sobs
were
heard
once

that
mother
with
her
children
sat
in
the
inner
room
but
not
all
all
were
not
there
the
pale
weeping
boy
was
no

clinging
to
his

side

slept
and
tears
would
never

his
eyelids

arthur
dust
was
now
fair
to
look
upon
he
had
never
been
a
beautiful
child
but
his
face
wore
a
sweet
and
mild
expression
in
life
and
it
was
serene
and
sweet
in
death
once
more
the
voice
of
prayer
was
heard
and
the
sweet
hymn
was
sung
once
more
they
walked
to
the
place
of
graves
and
he
who
just
eight
weeks
before
had
stood
weeping
there
was
now
gently
laid
down
to
sleep
that
sleep
which

seen
to
stand
in
martin
yard
as
the
body
of
his
young
master
was
carried
out
and
when
and
martin
returned
home
and
found
rover
was
not
there
they
supposed
he
had
gone
with
the
procession
and
had
remained
behind
at
his
old
home
and
therefore
they
felt
no
anxiety
about
him
at
hamilton
when
the
question
was
asked
where
is
rover
some
one
replied
he
staid
at
martin
probably
nothing
has
been
seen
of
him
here
he
would
now
be
more
fondly
cherished
than
ever
by
the
brothers
and
sisters
of
his
beloved
master
and
they
resolved
to
send
for
him
as
soon
as
possible
and
bring
him
back
he
had
been
such
a
fond
and
faithful
friend
to
dear
little
arthur
and
had
contributed
so
much
to
his
enjoyment
the
last
year
of
his
life
that
henceforth
he
would
be
associated
with
the
image
of
that
dear
dead
brother
and
would
have
for
them
a
tender
and
mournful
interest
when
they
sent
for
him
nothing
could
be
found
of
the
poor
creature
no
one
had
seen
him
nor
did
long
and
protracted
search
discover
any
tidings
or
traces
of
him
had
he
wandered
off
into
the
woods
on
that
mournful
day
and
laid
down
and
died
of
grief
had
he
been
stolen
and
carried
off
had
he
been
accidentally
destroyed
no
one
could
tell
no
one
ever
knew
but
now
after
long
years
have
passed
away
with
the
memory
of
little
arthur
hamilton
is
associated
that
of
the
faithful
rover
and
an
allusion
to
the
dear
child
so
early
called
away
is
sure
to
bring
up
the
remembrance
of
rover
and
of
his
mysterious
end
chapter
xi
the
two
graves
it
is
years
since
henry
and
arthur
hamilton
were
buried
in
that
little
last
spring
passing
by
the
spot
i
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
entered
the
quiet
little
enclosure
i
well
remembered
where
they
lay
after
this
lapse
of
years
and
without
difficulty
found
the
spot
two
small
white
stones
had
been
erected
and
i
sat
down
on
the
grass
and
spent
an
half
hour
in
gentle
musing
and
in
memories
once
more
the
manly
form
and
beaming
face
of
henry
hamilton
rose
before
me
and
i
seemed
to
hear
his
clear
ringing
laugh
i
thought
of
all
his
sanguine
hopes
and
earnest
plans
for
usefulness
how
eagerly
he
had
striven
to
excel
in
study
how
warmly
he
had
sympathized
with
the
suffering
and
sorrowful
how
joyfully
he
had
entered
into
the
recreations
of
the
happy
and
then
i
thought
of
the
sudden
blighting
of
all
those
warm
affections
those
passionate
desires
but
were
they
blighted
rather
was
not
all
that
was
good
and
lovely
in
him
still
existing
and
perfecting
was
he
not
still
loving
sympathizing
rejoicing
true
that
outward
form
was
now
dust
beneath
my
feet
and
it
was
sad
that
any
thing
so
beautiful
should
have
passed
away
from
before
our
eyes
but
the
soul
with
all
its
noble
longings
and
rich
aspirations
had
not
perished
with
it
when
oh
when
shall
we
learn
that
we
and
those
we
love
are
immortal
beings
when
shall
we
learn
that
death
does
not
destroy
only
remove
them
and
us
the
grass
had
sprung
up
thick
and
green
over
little
arthur
grave
and
the
sweet
morning
sunlight
lay
quietly
upon
it
one
little
blue
violet
had
opened
its
pretty
leaves
and
lay
there
smiling
i
was
about
to
pick
it
to
keep
as
a
little
memorial
of
the
spot
and
the
hour
but
it
seemed
so
full
of
life
so
fit
a
companion
for
the
precious
dust
beneath
i
would
not
shorten
its
existence
but
left
it
to
wither
there
my
tears
flowed
for
little
arthur
was
a
child
i
had
dearly
loved
but
yet
i
knew
not
why
i
should
mourn
his
early
death
the
god
who
had
watched
over
him
here
was
still
watching
over
him
and
we
need
not
fear
to
trust
that
loving
friend
death
is
not
terrible
in
itself
it
is
sin
that
makes
it
fearful
if
we
were
pure
and
holy
we
should
be
happy
here
or
in
another
world
just
where
god
thought
best
to
place
us
but
we
are
sinful
and
we
need
pardon
and
redemption
from
sin
before
we
can
look
calmly
and
fearlessly
upon
the
grave
jesus
christ
has
told
us
how
ready
he
is
to
forgive
sin
how
much
he
has
suffered
that
we
might
be
forgiven
and
to
every
human
being
even
to
the
youngest
who
reads
this
page
he
is
saying
come
unto
me
ye
that
are
weary
and
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
the
soul
return
return
my
soul
unto
thy
rest
from
vain
pursuits
and
maddening
cares
from
lonely
woes
that
wring
thy
breast
the
world
allurements
toils
and
snares
return
unto
thy
rest
my
soul
from
all
the
wanderings
of
thy
thought
from
sickness
unto
death
made
whole
safe
through
a
thousand
perils
brought
then
to
thy
rest
my
soul
return
from
passions
every
hour
at
strife
sin
works
and
ways
and
wages
spurn
lay
hold
upon
eternal
life
god
is
thy
rest
with
heart
inclined
to
keep
his
word
that
word
believe
christ
is
thy
rest
with
lowly
mind
his
light
and
easy
yoke
receive
the
end
