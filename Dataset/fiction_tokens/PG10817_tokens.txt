severn
and
the
fieldings
i
children
i
anne
severn
had
come
again
to
the
fieldings
this
time
it
was
because
her
mother
was
dead
she
had
been
in
the
house
five
minutes
before
she
asked
jerrold
fancy
they
said
her
remembering
and
jerrold
had
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
and
gone
out
again
when
he
saw
her
there
in
her
black
frock
and
somehow
she
had
known
he
was
afraid
to
come
in
because
her
mother
was
dead
her
father
had
brought
her
to
that
morning
the
day
after
the
funeral
he
would
leave
her
there
when
he
went
back
to
india
she
was
walking
now
down
the
lawn
between
the
two
tall
men
they
were
taking
her
to
the
pond
at
the
bottom
where
the
goldfish
were
it
was
jerrold
father
who
held
her
hand
and
talked
to
her
he
had
a
nice
brown
face
marked
with
a
lot
of
little
fine
smiling
strokes
and
his
eyes
were
quick
and
kind
you
remember
the
goldfish
anne
i
remember
everything
she
had
been
such
a
little
girl
before
and
they
said
she
had
forgotten
but
she
remembered
so
well
that
she
always
thought
of
mr
fielding
as
jerrold
father
she
remembered
the
pond
and
the
goldfish
jerrold
held
her
tight
so
that
she
should
tumble
in
she
remembered
the
big
grey
and
yellow
house
with
its
nine
gables
and
the
lawn
shut
in
by
clipped
yew
hedges
then
spreading
downwards
like
a
fan
from
the
last
green
terrace
where
the
two
enormous
peacocks
stood
carved
out
of
the
yew
where
it
lay
flat
and
still
under
the
green
wall
she
saw
the
tennis
court
jerrold
was
there
knocking
balls
over
the
net
to
please
little
colin
she
could
see
him
fling
back
his
head
and
laugh
as
colin
ran
stumbling
waving
his
racquet
before
him
like
a
stiff
flag
she
heard
colin
squeal
with
excitement
as
the
balls
flew
out
of
his
reach
her
father
was
talking
about
her
his
voice
was
sharp
and
anxious
i
do
know
how
she
get
on
with
your
boys
he
always
talked
about
anne
as
if
she
was
there
ten
an
awkward
age
she
too
old
for
colin
and
too
young
for
eliot
and
jerrold
she
knew
their
ages
colin
was
only
seven
eliot
the
clever
one
was
very
big
he
was
fifteen
jerrold
was
thirteen
she
heard
jerrold
father
answering
in
his
quiet
voice
you
need
worry
jerry
look
after
anne
all
right
and
adeline
oh
yes
of
course
adeline
only
somehow
he
made
it
sound
as
if
she
would
adeline
was
mrs
fielding
jerrold
mother
anne
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
quiet
serious
men
and
play
with
jerrold
but
their
idea
seemed
to
be
that
it
was
too
soon
too
soon
after
the
funeral
it
would
be
all
right
to
go
quietly
and
look
at
the
goldfish
but
no
not
to
play
when
she
thought
of
her
dead
mother
she
was
afraid
to
tell
them
that
she
did
want
to
go
and
look
at
the
goldfish
it
was
as
if
she
knew
that
something
sad
waited
for
her
by
the
pond
at
the
bottom
she
would
be
safer
over
there
where
jerrold
was
laughing
and
shouting
she
would
play
with
him
and
he
would
be
afraid
the
day
felt
like
a
sunday
quiet
quiet
except
for
the
noise
of
jerrold
laughter
strange
and
exciting
his
boy
voice
rang
through
her
sadness
it
made
her
turn
her
head
again
and
again
to
look
after
him
it
called
to
her
to
forget
and
play
little
slim
brown
minnows
darted
backwards
and
forwards
under
the
olive
green
water
of
the
pond
and
every
now
and
then
the
fat
goldfish
came
nosing
along
orange
with
silver
patches
shining
making
the
water
light
round
them
stiff
mouths
wide
open
when
they
bobbed
up
small
bubbles
broke
from
them
and
sparkled
and
went
out
anne
remembered
the
goldfish
but
somehow
they
were
not
so
fascinating
as
they
used
to
be
a
queer
plant
grew
on
the
rock
border
of
the
pond
green
fleshy
stems
with
blunt
spikes
all
over
them
each
carried
a
tiny
gold
star
at
its
tip
thick
cold
juice
would
come
out
of
it
if
you
squeezed
it
she
thought
it
would
smell
like
lavender
it
had
a
name
she
tried
to
think
of
it
stonecrop
stonecrop
suddenly
she
remembered
her
mother
stood
with
her
by
the
pond
dark
and
white
and
slender
anne
held
out
her
hands
smeared
with
the
crushed
flesh
of
the
stonecrop
her
mother
stooped
and
wiped
them
with
her
pockethandkerchief
and
there
was
a
smell
of
lavender
the
goldfish
went
swimming
by
in
the
water
anne
sadness
came
over
her
again
sadness
so
heavy
that
it
kept
her
from
crying
sadness
that
crushed
her
breast
and
made
her
throat
ache
they
went
back
up
the
lawn
quietly
and
the
day
felt
more
and
more
like
sunday
or
like
like
a
funeral
day
she
very
silent
this
small
daughter
of
yours
mr
fielding
said
yes
said
severn
his
voice
came
with
a
stiff
jerk
as
if
it
choked
him
he
remembered
too
ii
the
grey
and
yellow
flagstones
of
the
terrace
were
hot
under
your
feet
jerrold
mother
lay
out
there
on
a
pile
of
cushions
in
the
sun
she
was
very
large
and
very
beautiful
she
lay
on
her
side
heaved
up
on
one
elbow
under
her
thin
white
gown
you
could
see
the
big
lines
of
her
shoulder
and
hip
and
of
her
long
full
thigh
tapering
to
the
knee
anne
crouched
beside
her
uncomfortably
holding
her
little
body
away
from
the
great
warm
mass
among
the
cushions
mrs
fielding
was
aware
of
this
shrinking
she
put
out
her
arm
and
drew
anne
to
her
side
again
lean
back
she
said
close
closer
and
anne
would
lean
close
politely
for
a
minute
and
then
stiffen
and
shrink
away
again
when
the
soft
arm
slackened
eliot
fielding
the
clever
one
lay
on
his
stomach
stretched
out
across
the
terrace
he
leaned
over
a
book
he
was
absorbed
in
a
diagram
of
a
rabbit
heart
and
took
no
notice
of
his
mother
or
of
anne
anne
had
been
at
the
manor
five
days
and
she
had
got
used
to
mother
caresses
all
but
one
every
now
and
then
mrs
fielding
hand
would
stray
to
the
back
of
anne
neck
where
the
short
curls
black
as
her
frock
sprang
out
in
a
thick
bunch
the
fingers
stirred
among
the
roots
of
anne
hair
stroking
stroking
lifting
the
bunch
and
letting
it
fall
again
and
whenever
they
did
this
anne
jerked
her
head
away
and
held
it
stiffly
out
of
their
reach
she
remembered
how
her
mother
fingers
slender
and
and
loving
had
done
just
that
and
how
their
touch
went
thrilling
through
the
back
of
her
neck
how
it
made
her
heart
beat
mrs
fingers
did
thrill
you
they
were
blunt
and
fumbling
anne
thought
she
no
business
to
touch
me
like
that
no
business
to
think
she
can
do
what
mother
did
she
was
always
doing
it
always
trying
to
be
a
mother
to
her
her
father
had
told
her
she
was
going
to
try
and
anne
would
let
her
she
would
not
let
her
why
do
you
move
your
head
away
darling
anne
did
answer
you
used
to
love
it
you
used
to
come
bending
your
funny
little
neck
and
turning
first
one
ear
and
than
the
other
like
a
little
cat
and
now
you
wo
let
me
touch
you
no
no
not
like
that
yes
yes
like
this
you
do
remember
i
remember
she
felt
the
blunt
fingers
on
her
neck
again
and
started
up
the
beautiful
wilful
woman
lay
back
on
her
cushions
smiling
to
herself
you
a
funny
little
thing
are
you
she
said
anne
eyes
were
glassed
she
shook
her
head
fiercely
and
spilled
tears
jerrold
had
come
up
on
to
the
terrace
colin
trotted
after
him
they
were
looking
at
her
eliot
had
raised
his
head
from
his
book
and
was
looking
at
her
it
rotten
of
you
mater
he
said
to
tease
that
kid
i
not
teasing
her
really
eliot
you
do
say
things
as
if
nobody
but
yourself
had
any
sense
you
can
run
away
now
anne
darling
anne
stood
staring
with
wild
animal
eyes
that
saw
no
place
to
run
to
it
was
jerrold
who
saved
her
i
say
would
you
like
to
see
my
new
buck
rabbit
rather
he
held
out
his
hand
and
she
ran
on
with
him
along
the
terrace
down
the
steps
at
the
corner
and
up
the
drive
to
the
stable
yard
where
the
rabbits
were
colin
followed
headlong
and
as
she
went
anne
heard
eliot
saying
i
sense
enough
to
remember
that
her
mother
dead
in
his
worst
tempers
there
was
always
some
fierce
pity
iii
mrs
fielding
gathered
herself
together
and
rose
with
dignity
still
smiling
it
was
a
smile
of
great
sweetness
infinitely
remote
from
all
discussion
it
much
too
hot
here
she
said
you
might
move
the
cushions
down
there
under
the
that
eliot
put
it
to
himself
was
just
her
way
of
getting
out
of
it
to
eliot
the
irritating
thing
about
his
mother
was
her
dexterity
in
getting
out
she
never
lost
her
temper
and
never
replied
to
any
serious
criticism
she
simply
changed
the
subject
leaving
you
with
your
disapproval
on
your
hands
in
this
eliot
young
subtlety
misled
him
adeline
fielding
mind
was
not
the
clever
calculating
thing
that
at
fifteen
he
thought
it
her
one
simple
idea
was
to
be
happy
and
as
a
means
to
that
end
to
have
people
happy
about
her
his
father
or
anne
father
could
have
told
him
that
all
her
ideas
were
simple
as
feelings
and
impromptu
impulse
moved
her
one
moment
to
seize
on
the
faithful
defiant
little
heart
of
anne
the
next
to
get
up
out
of
the
sun
anne
tears
spoiled
her
bright
world
but
not
for
long
coolness
was
now
the
important
thing
not
anne
and
not
anne
mother
as
for
eliot
disapproval
she
was
no
longer
aware
of
it
oh
to
be
cool
to
be
cool
again
thank
you
my
son
eliot
had
moved
all
the
cushions
down
under
the
tree
scowling
as
he
did
it
for
he
knew
that
when
his
mother
was
really
cool
he
would
have
to
get
up
and
move
them
back
again
with
the
perfect
curve
of
a
great
supple
animal
she
turned
and
settled
in
her
lair
under
her
tree
presently
down
the
steps
and
across
the
lawn
anne
father
came
towards
her
grave
handsome
and
alone
handsome
even
after
fifteen
years
of
india
handsomer
than
when
he
was
young
more
distinguished
eyes
lighter
in
the
sallowish
bronze
she
liked
his
lean
eager
deerhound
face
ready
to
start
off
sniffing
the
trail
a
little
strained
leashed
now
john
eagerness
but
that
was
how
he
used
to
come
to
her
with
that
look
of
being
ready
as
if
they
could
do
things
together
she
had
tried
to
find
his
youth
in
anne
face
but
anne
blackness
and
whiteness
were
her
mother
her
little
nose
was
still
soft
and
vague
you
could
tell
what
she
would
be
like
in
five
years
time
still
there
was
something
the
same
strange
quality
the
same
grace
before
he
reached
her
adeline
was
smiling
again
a
smile
of
the
delicate
instinctive
mouth
of
the
blue
eyes
shining
between
curled
lids
under
dark
eyebrows
of
the
innocent
white
nose
of
the
whole
soft
face
even
her
sleek
dark
hair
smiled
shining
she
was
conscious
of
her
power
to
make
him
come
to
her
to
make
herself
felt
through
everything
even
through
his
bereavement
the
subtle
eliot
looking
over
the
terrace
wall
observed
her
and
thought
the
mater
jolly
pleased
with
herself
i
wonder
why
it
struck
eliot
also
that
a
commissioner
of
ambala
and
a
member
of
the
legislative
council
and
a
widower
ought
not
to
look
like
severn
he
was
too
lively
too
adventurous
he
turned
again
to
the
enthralling
page
the
student
should
lay
open
the
theoracic
cavity
of
the
rabbit
and
dissect
away
the
thymous
gland
and
other
tissues
which
hide
the
origin
of
the
great
vessels
so
as
to
display
the
heart
yearp
the
vet
would
show
him
how
to
do
that
iv
his
name
benjy
he
a
butterfly
smut
said
jerrold
the
rabbit
was
quiet
now
he
sat
in
anne
arms
couching
his
forepaws
laid
on
her
breast
she
stooped
and
kissed
his
soft
nose
that
went
in
and
out
pushing
against
her
mouth
in
a
delicate
palpitation
he
was
white
with
black
ears
and
a
black
oval
at
the
root
of
his
tail
two
patches
went
up
from
his
nose
like
a
moustache
that
was
his
butterfly
smut
he
sweet
she
said
colin
said
it
after
her
in
his
shrill
child
voice
he
is
sweet
colin
had
a
habit
of
repeating
what
you
said
it
was
his
way
of
joining
in
the
conversation
he
stretched
up
his
hand
and
stroked
benjy
and
anne
felt
the
heart
beat
sharp
and
quick
against
her
breast
a
shiver
went
through
benjy
body
anne
kissed
him
again
her
heart
swelled
and
shook
with
maternal
tenderness
why
does
he
tremble
so
he
frightened
do
touch
him
colin
could
see
an
animal
without
wanting
to
stroke
it
he
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
to
keep
them
out
of
temptation
by
the
way
jerrold
looked
at
him
you
saw
how
he
loved
him
about
colin
there
was
something
beautiful
and
breakable
face
little
tidy
nose
and
mouth
dark
hair
and
eyes
like
the
minnows
swimming
under
the
green
water
but
jerrold
face
was
strong
and
he
had
funny
eyes
that
made
you
keep
looking
at
him
they
were
blue
not
tiresomely
blue
blue
all
the
time
like
his
mother
but
secretly
and
surprisingly
blue
a
blue
that
flashed
at
you
and
hid
again
moving
queerly
in
the
set
squareness
of
his
face
presenting
at
every
turn
a
different
jerrold
he
had
a
pleasing
straight
up
and
down
nose
his
one
constant
feature
the
nostrils
slanted
slightly
upward
making
shadows
there
you
got
to
know
these
things
after
watching
him
attentively
anne
loved
his
mouth
best
of
all
cross
one
minute
only
never
with
colin
sweet
the
next
tilted
at
the
corners
ready
for
his
laughter
he
stood
close
beside
her
in
his
white
flannels
straight
and
slender
he
was
looking
at
her
just
as
he
looked
at
colin
do
you
like
him
he
said
who
colin
no
benjy
i
him
i
give
him
to
you
if
you
like
to
have
him
for
my
own
to
keep
rather
do
you
want
him
yes
but
i
like
you
to
have
him
oh
jerrold
she
knew
he
was
giving
her
benjy
because
her
mother
was
dead
i
got
the
grey
doe
and
the
fawn
and
the
he
said
oh
i
love
him
you
must
hold
him
too
tight
and
you
must
be
careful
not
to
touch
his
stomach
if
you
squeeze
him
there
he
die
yes
if
you
squeeze
his
stomach
he
die
colin
cried
excitedly
i
be
ever
so
careful
they
put
him
down
and
he
ran
violently
round
and
round
drumming
with
his
hind
legs
on
the
floor
of
the
shed
startling
the
does
that
couched
like
cats
among
the
lettuce
leaves
and
carrots
when
the
little
rabbits
come
half
of
them
will
be
yours
because
be
their
father
oh
for
the
first
time
since
friday
week
anne
was
happy
she
loved
the
rabbit
she
loved
little
colin
and
more
than
anybody
or
anything
she
loved
jerrold
yet
afterwards
in
her
bed
in
the
night
nursery
when
she
thought
of
her
dead
mother
she
lay
awake
crying
quietly
so
that
nobody
could
hear
v
it
was
robert
fielding
birthday
anne
was
to
dine
late
that
evening
sitting
beside
him
he
said
that
was
his
birthday
treat
anne
had
made
him
a
penwiper
of
green
cloth
with
a
large
blue
bead
in
the
middle
for
a
knob
he
was
going
to
keep
it
for
ever
he
had
no
candles
on
his
birthday
cake
at
tea
because
there
would
have
been
too
many
the
big
hall
of
the
manor
was
furnished
like
a
room
the
wide
oak
staircase
came
down
into
it
from
a
gallery
that
went
all
around
they
were
waiting
there
for
mrs
fielding
who
was
always
a
little
late
that
made
you
keep
on
thinking
about
her
they
were
thinking
about
her
now
up
there
a
door
opened
and
shut
something
moved
along
the
gallery
like
a
large
light
and
mrs
fielding
came
down
the
stairs
slowly
prolonging
her
effect
she
was
dressed
in
her
old
gown
a
rope
of
pearls
went
round
her
neck
and
hung
between
her
breasts
roll
above
roll
of
hair
jutted
out
at
the
back
of
her
head
across
it
the
foremost
curl
rose
like
a
comb
shining
her
eyes
intensely
blue
in
her
face
sparkled
between
two
dark
wings
of
hair
her
mouth
smiled
its
enchanting
and
enchanted
smile
she
was
aware
that
her
husband
and
john
watched
her
from
stair
to
stair
she
was
aware
of
their
men
eyes
darkening
then
suddenly
she
was
aware
of
john
daughter
anne
was
coming
towards
her
across
the
hall
drawn
by
the
magic
by
the
eyes
by
the
sweet
flower
smell
that
drifted
not
lavender
not
lavender
she
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
looking
up
the
heavenly
thing
swept
down
to
her
and
she
broke
into
a
cry
oh
you
beautiful
you
beautiful
mrs
fielding
stopped
her
progress
so
are
you
you
little
darling
she
stooped
quickly
and
kissed
her
holding
her
tight
to
her
breast
crushed
down
into
the
bed
of
the
flower
scent
anne
gave
herself
up
caught
by
the
sweetness
and
the
beauty
you
rogue
said
adeline
at
last
i
got
you
she
could
bear
to
be
repulsed
to
have
anything
about
her
even
a
cat
or
a
dog
that
had
not
surrendered
vi
every
evening
soon
after
colin
nanna
had
tucked
anne
up
in
her
bed
and
left
her
the
door
of
the
night
nursery
would
open
letting
a
light
in
when
anne
saw
the
light
coming
she
shut
her
eyes
and
burrowed
under
the
blankets
she
knew
it
was
auntie
adeline
trying
to
be
a
mother
to
her
you
called
them
auntie
adeline
and
uncle
robert
to
please
them
though
they
were
relations
every
night
she
would
hear
aunt
adeline
feet
on
the
floor
and
her
candle
clattering
on
the
chest
of
drawers
she
would
feel
her
hands
drawing
back
the
blankets
and
her
face
bending
down
over
her
the
mouth
would
brush
her
forehead
and
she
would
lie
stiff
and
still
keeping
her
eyes
tight
shut
she
heard
voices
at
the
door
and
somebody
else
feet
going
behind
aunt
adeline
somebody
else
whispered
she
asleep
that
was
jerrold
jerrold
she
felt
him
standing
beside
his
mother
looking
at
her
and
her
eyelids
fluttered
but
she
lay
still
she
is
asleep
at
all
said
aunt
adeline
she
shamming
the
little
monkey
jerrold
thought
he
knew
why
he
turned
into
the
old
nursery
that
was
the
schoolroom
now
and
found
eliot
there
examining
a
fly
leg
under
his
microscope
it
was
eliot
that
he
i
say
you
know
mum
making
a
jolly
mistake
about
that
kid
trying
to
go
on
as
if
she
was
anne
mother
you
can
see
it
makes
her
sick
it
would
me
if
my
mother
was
dead
eliot
looked
as
if
he
was
listening
absorbed
in
his
fly
leg
somebody
got
to
tell
her
are
you
going
to
said
eliot
or
shall
i
neither
i
shall
get
dad
to
he
do
it
best
vii
robert
fielding
did
do
it
all
at
once
he
put
it
off
till
adeline
gave
him
his
chance
he
found
her
alone
in
the
library
and
she
had
begun
it
robert
i
do
know
what
to
do
about
that
child
which
child
anne
she
been
here
five
weeks
and
i
done
everything
i
know
and
she
has
shown
me
a
scrap
of
affection
it
pretty
hard
if
i
to
house
and
feed
the
little
thing
and
look
after
her
like
a
mother
and
get
nothing
nothing
but
half
a
cold
little
face
to
kiss
night
and
morning
it
is
good
enough
for
anne
for
me
my
dear
trying
to
be
a
mother
to
somebody
else
child
who
does
love
you
and
is
going
to
love
you
do
try
then
do
try
do
try
and
be
a
mother
to
her
that
what
anne
does
like
they
had
got
as
far
as
that
when
john
severn
stood
in
the
doorway
he
was
retreating
before
their
appearance
of
communion
when
she
called
him
back
do
go
john
we
want
you
here
robert
telling
me
not
to
be
a
mother
to
anne
and
here
adeline
worrying
because
she
thinks
anne
is
going
to
love
her
severn
sat
down
considering
it
it
takes
time
he
said
she
looked
at
him
smiling
under
lowered
brows
time
to
love
me
time
for
anne
to
love
you
she
she
so
desperately
faithful
the
clanged
from
the
belfry
robert
left
them
to
finish
a
discussion
that
he
found
embarrassing
i
said
i
try
to
be
a
mother
to
her
i
tried
john
but
the
little
thing
wo
let
me
do
try
too
hard
robert
right
do
do
be
a
mother
to
her
what
am
i
to
be
oh
anything
you
like
a
presence
a
heavenly
apparition
an
impossible
ideal
anything
but
that
do
you
think
she
going
to
hold
out
for
ever
only
against
that
as
long
as
she
remembers
it
puts
her
off
she
does
object
to
robert
being
a
father
to
her
no
because
he
a
better
father
than
i
am
and
she
knows
it
adeline
flushed
she
understood
the
implication
and
was
hurt
unreasonably
he
saw
her
unreasonableness
and
her
pain
my
dear
adeline
anne
mother
will
always
be
anne
mother
i
was
never
anywhere
beside
alice
i
had
to
choose
between
the
government
of
india
and
my
daughter
you
observe
that
i
do
try
to
be
a
father
to
anne
and
that
in
consequence
anne
likes
me
but
she
robert
and
me
if
i
do
try
give
her
time
give
her
time
he
rose
smiling
down
at
her
you
think
i
unreasonable
the
least
bit
in
the
world
for
the
moment
my
dear
john
if
i
did
love
your
little
girl
i
would
care
love
her
love
her
she
love
you
too
in
her
rum
way
she
fighting
you
now
she
would
fight
if
she
did
feel
she
was
beaten
nobody
could
hold
out
against
you
long
she
looked
at
the
clock
heavens
i
must
go
and
dress
she
thought
did
hold
out
against
me
poor
dear
five
minutes
i
suppose
he
always
remember
that
i
jilted
him
for
robert
and
now
he
wanted
her
to
see
that
if
anne
mother
would
be
always
anne
mother
his
wife
would
be
always
his
wife
was
he
desperately
faithful
too
always
how
could
he
have
been
it
was
characteristic
of
alice
severn
that
when
she
had
to
choose
between
her
husband
and
her
daughter
she
had
chosen
anne
it
was
characteristic
of
john
that
when
he
had
to
choose
between
his
wife
and
his
government
he
had
not
chosen
alice
he
must
have
had
adventures
out
in
india
conducted
with
the
discretion
becoming
in
a
commissioner
and
a
member
of
the
legislative
council
but
adventures
perhaps
he
was
going
back
to
one
of
them
severn
dressed
hastily
and
went
into
the
schoolroom
where
anne
sat
reading
in
her
solitary
hour
between
supper
time
and
he
took
her
on
his
knee
and
she
snuggled
there
rubbing
her
head
against
his
shoulder
he
thought
of
adeline
teasing
teasing
for
the
caresses
and
every
time
repulsed
anne
he
said
do
you
think
you
can
love
auntie
adeline
anne
straightened
herself
she
looked
at
him
with
candid
eyes
i
know
daddy
really
if
i
can
ca
you
love
her
a
little
i
i
would
if
she
would
try

robert
was
right
he
knew
it
but
he
wanted
to
be
sure
anne
went
on
it
no
use

see
her
trying
it
only
makes
me
think
of
mummy

do

to
think
of
her

but

want
to
think

myself
and
auntie
adeline
keeps
on
getting
in
the
way
still
she
awfully
kind
to
you
is
she
awfully
and
you
must
hurt
her
feelings
have
i
i
did
mean

if

hurt
her
feelings

on
thinking
about

i
know
anne
i
know
anne
mind
burrowed
under
turning
on
its
tracks
coming
out
suddenly
do
you
love
auntie
adeline
daddy
it
was
terrible
but
he
owned
that
he
had
brought
it
on
himself
i
ca

i
known
her
such
a
long
time
before
you
were
born
before

married
mummy
yes

if

in
another
week
he

ambala
viii
jerrold
was
brave
when
colin
upset
the
schoolroom
lamp
jerrold
wrapped
it
in
the
tablecloth
and
threw
it
out
of
the
window
just
in
time
he
put
the
chain
on
billy
the
when
he
went
mad
and
snapped
at
everybody
it
seemed
odd
that
jerrold
should
be
frightened
a
minute
ago
he
had
been
happy
rolling
over
and
over
on
the
grass
shouting
with
laughter
while
sandy
the
aberdeen
jumped
on
him
growling
his
merry
puppy
growl
and
biting
the
balled
fists
that
pushed
him
off
they
were
all
out
on
the
lawn
anne
waited
for
jerry
to
get
up
and
take
her
into
wyck
to
buy
chocolates
every
time
jerrold
laughed
his
mother
laughed
too
a
throaty
girlish
giggle
i
love
jerry
laugh
she
said
it
the
nicest
noise
he
makes
then
suddenly
she
stopped
it
she
stopped
it
with
a
word
if
you
going
into
wyck
jerry
you
might
tell
yearp
yearp

got
up
his
face

very
red

and
frightened

said
jerry
defiantly
she

because

like
to
think
she
got
it
eliot

go
himself
fond
of
yearp

do
as
you
told
jerry
it
downright
cowardice
it
is
cowardice

his
father
it
is
exactly
courage
whatever
it
is
his
mother
said
you
have
to
get
over
it
you
go
on
as
if
nobody
cared
about
poor
binky
but
yourself
binky
was
jerry
dog
he
had
run
into
a
in
the
easter
holidays
and
hurt
his
back
so
that
yearp
the
vet
had
had
to
come
and
give
him
chloroform
that
was
why
jerrold
was
afraid
of
yearp
when
he
saw
him
he
saw
binky
with
his
nose
in
the
cup
of
chloroform
he
heard
him
snorting
out
his
last
breath
and
he
could
bear
it
i
could
send
one
of
the
men
his
father
was
saying
do
encourage
him
robert
he
got
to
face
it
yes
jerrold
you
better
go
and
get
it
over
you
ca
go
on
funking
it
for
ever
jerrold
went
but
he
went
alone
he
would
let
anne
go
with
him
he
said
he
did
want
her
to
be
mixed
up
with
it
he
means
said
eliot
that
he
does
want
to
think
of
yearp
every
time
he
sees
anne
ix
it
was
true
that
eliot
was
fond
of
yearp
society
he
would
spend
hours
with
him
learning
how
to
dissect
frogs
and
rabbits
and
pigeons
he
drove
about
the
country
with
yearp
seeing
the
sick
animals
the
ewes
at
lambing
time
and
the
cows
at
their
calving
and
he
spent
half
the
midsummer
holidays
reading
and
drawing
diagrams
of
frogs
hearts
and
pigeons
brains
he
said
he
was
going
to
oxford
or
cambridge
when
he
left
cheltenham
he
was
going
to
barts
he
wanted
to
be
a
doctor
but
his
mother
said
he
did
know
what
he
want
to
be
in
three
years
time
she
thought
him
awful
with
his
frogs
hearts
and
horrors
next
to
jerrold
and
little
colin
anne
loved
eliot
he
seemed
to
know
when
she
was
thinking
about
her
mother
and
to
understand
he
took
her
into
the
woods
to
look
for
squirrels
he
showed
her
the
wildflowers
and
told
her
all
their
names
bugloss
and
lady
smock
and
speedwell
willow
herb
and
meadow
sweet
crane
bill
and
celandine
one
day
they
found
in
the
garden
a
tiny
shell
made
of
lattice
work
when
they
put
it
under
the
microscope
they
saw
inside
it
a
thing
like
a
green
egg
every
day
they
watched
it
it
put
out
two
green
horns
and
a
ridge
grew
down
the
middle
of
it
and
one
morning
they
found
the
golden
shell
broken
a
long
elegant
fly
with
slender
wings
crawled
beside
it
when
benjy
died
of
eating
too
much
lettuce
eliot
was
sorry
aunt
adeline
said
it
was
all
put
on
and
that
he
really
wanted
to
cut
him
up
and
see
what
he
was
made
of
but
eliot
did
he
said
benjy
was
sacred
that
was
because
he
knew
they
loved
him
and
he
dug
the
grave
and
lined
it
with
moss
and
told
aunt
adeline
to
shut
up
when
she
said
it
ought
to
have
been
lettuce
leaves
aunt
adeline
complained
that
it
was
hard
that
eliot
could
be
nice
to
her
when
he
was
her
favorite
little
anne
little
anne
what
have
you
done
to
my
eliot
she
was
always
saying
things
like
that
anne
could
think
what
she
meant
till
jerrold
told
her
she
was
the
only
kid
that
eliot
had
ever
looked
at
the
big
hawtrey
girl
from
medlicote
would
have
given
her
head
to
be
in
anne
shoes
but
anne
did
care
her
love
for
jerrold
was
sharp
and
exciting
she
brought
tears
to
it
and
temper
it
was
mixed
up
with
god
and
music
and
the
deaths
of
animals
and
sunsets
and
all
sorrowful
and
beautiful
and
mysterious
things
thinking
about
her
mother
made
her
think
about
jerrold
but
she
never
thought
about
eliot
at
all
when
he
was
there
she
would
run
away
from
eliot
any
minute
if
she
heard
jerrold
calling
it
was
jerrold
jerrold
all
the
time
said
aunt
adeline
and
when
eliot
was
busy
with
his
microscope
and
jerrold
had
turned
from
her
to
colin
there
was
uncle
robert
he
seemed
to
know
the
moments
when
she
wanted
him
then
he
would
take
her
out
riding
with
him
over
the
estate
that
stretched
from
wyck
across
the
valley
of
the
speed
and
beyond
it
for
miles
over
the
hills
and
he
would
show
her
the
reaping
machines
at
work
and
the
great
carthorses
and
the
prize
bullocks
in
their
stalls
at
the
manor
farm
and
anne
told
him
her
secret
the
secret
she
had
told
to
nobody
but
jerrold
some
day
she
said
i
shall
have
a
farm
with
horses
and
cows
and
pigs
and
little
calves
shall
you
like
that
yes
said
anne
i
would
only
it
ca
happen
till
grandpapa
dead
and
i
do
want
him
to
die
x
they
were
saying
now
that
colin
was
wonderful
he
was
only
seven
yet
he
could
play
the
piano
like
a
person
very
fast
and
with
loud
noises
in
the
bass
and
he
could
sing
like
an
angel
when
you
heard
him
you
could
hardly
believe
that
he
was
a
little
boy
who
cried
sometimes
and
was
afraid
of
ghosts
two
masters
came
out
from
cheltenham
twice
a
week
to
teach
him
eliot
said
colin
would
be
a
professional
when
he
grew
up
but
his
mother
said
he
should
be
nothing
of
the
sort
and
eliot
was
to
go
putting
nonsense
like
that
into
his
head
still
she
was
proud
of
colin
when
his
hands
went
pounding
and
flashing
over
the
keys
anne
had
to
give
up
practising
because
she
did
it
so
badly
that
it
hurt
colin
to
hear
her
he
was
in
the
least
conceited
about
his
playing
not
even
when
jerrold
stood
beside
him
and
looked
on
and
said
clever
he
a
wonderful
kid
look
at
him
look
at
his
little
hands
all
over
the
place
he
did
think
playing
was
wonderful
he
thought
the
things
that
jerrold
did
were
wonderful
with
his
child
legs
and
arms
he
tried
to
do
the
things
that
jerrold
did
they
told
him
he
would
have
to
wait
nine
years
before
he
could
do
them
he
was
always
talking
about
what
he
would
do
in
nine
years
time
and
there
was
the
day
of
the
walk
to
high
slaughter
through
the
valley
of
the
speed
to
the
valley
of
the
windlode
five
miles
there
and
back
eliot
and
jerrold
and
anne
had
tried
to
sneak
out
when
colin
looking
but
he
had
seen
them
and
came
running
after
them
down
the
field
calling
to
them
to
let
him
come
eliot
shouted
we
ca
it
too
far
but
colin
looked
so
pathetic
standing
there
in
the
big
field
that
jerrold
could
bear
it
i
think
he
said
we
might
let
him
come
yes
let
him
anne
said
rot
he
ca
walk
it
i
can
said
colin
i
can
i
tell
you
he
ca
if
he
tired
he
be
sick
in
the
night
and
then
he
say
it
ghosts
colin
mouth
trembled
it
all
right
you
coming
jerrold
held
out
his
hand
well
said
eliot
if
he
crumples
up
can
carry
him
i
can
said
jerrold
so
can
i
said
anne
nobody
said
colin
shall
carry
me
i
can
walk
eliot
went
on
grumbling
while
colin
trotted
happily
beside
them
a
fearful
ass
jerrold
you
simple
ruining
that
kid
he
thinks
he
can
come
butting
into
everything
here
the
whole
afternoon
spoiled
for
all
three
of
us
he
ca
walk
you
see
he
drop
out
in
the
first
mile
i
sha
jerrold
and
he
did
he
struggled
on
down
the
fields
to
upper
speed
and
along
the
to
lower
speed
and
hayes
mill
and
from
hayes
mill
to
high
slaughter
it
was
when
they
started
to
walk
back
that
his
legs
betrayed
him
slackening
first
then
running
because
running
was
easier
than
walking
for
a
change
then
dragging
then
being
dragged
between
anne
and
jerrold
for
he
refused
to
be
carried
then
staggering
stumbling
stopping
dead
his
child
mouth
drooping
then
jerrold
carried
him
on
his
back
with
his
hands
clasped
under
colin
soft
hips
colin
body
slipped
every
minute
and
had
to
be
jerked
up
again
and
when
it
slipped
his
arms
tightened
round
neck
strangling
him
at
last
jerrold
too
staggered
and
stumbled
and
stopped
dead
i
take
him
said
eliot
he
forbore
nobly
to
say
i
told
you
so
and
by
turns
they
carried
him
from
the
valley
of
the
windlode
to
the
valley
of
the
speed
past
hayes
mill
through
lower
speed
upper
speed
and
up
the
fields
to
wyck
manor
then
up
the
stairs
to
the
schoolroom
pursued
by
their
mother
cries
oh
my
little
what
have
you
done
to
him
eliot
eliot
bore
it
like
a
lamb
only
after
they
had
left
colin
in
the
schoolroom
he
turned
on
jerrold
some
day
he
said
will
be
a
perfect
nuisance
then
you
and
anne
have
to
pay
for
it
why
me
and
anne
because
you
both
be
fools
enough
to
keep
on
giving
in
to
him
i
suppose
said
jerrold
bitterly
you
think
you
clever
adeline
came
out
and
overheard
him
and
made
a
scene
in
the
gallery
before
pinkney
the
footman
who
was
bringing
in
the
schoolroom
tea
she
said
eliot
was
clever
enough
and
old
enough
to
know
better
they
were
all
old
enough
and
jerrold
said
it
was
his
fault
not
eliot
and
anne
said
it
was
hers
too
and
adeline
declared
that
it
was
all
their
faults
and
she
would
have
to
speak
to
their
father
she
kept
it
up
long
after
eliot
and
jerrold
had
retreated
to
the
bathroom
if
it
had
been
anybody
but
her
little
she
would
him
dragged
about
the
country
till
he
dropped
she
added
that
was
her
favourite
xi
it
was
the
last
week
of
the
holidays
rain
had
come
with
the
west
wind
the
hills
were
drawn
back
behind
thick
sheets
of
glassy
rain
shining
spears
of
rain
dashed
themselves
against
the
west
windows
jets
of
rain
rose
up
whirling
and
spraying
from
the
terrace
rain
ran
before
the
wind
in
a
silver
scud
along
the
flagged
path
under
the
south
front
the
wind
made
hard
thudding
noises
as
if
it
pounded
invisible
bodies
in
the
air
it
screamed
high
above
the
drumming
and
hissing
of
the
rain
it
excited
the
children
from
three
till
the
sponge
fight
stormed
up
and
down
the
passages
the
house
was
filled
with
the
sound
of
thudding
feet
and
shrill
laughter
adeline
lay
on
the
sofa
in
the
library
eliot
was
with
her
there
she
was
amused
but
a
little
plaintive
when
they
rushed
in
to
her
it
perfectly
awful
the
noise
you
children
are
making
i
tired
out
with
it
jerrold
flung
himself
on
her
tired
what
must
be
but
he
was
tired
his
madness
still
worked
in
him
it
sought
some
supreme
expression
what
can
we
play
at
next
said
anne
what
can
we
play
at
next
said
colin
something
quiet
for
goodness
sake
said
his
mother
they
were
very
quiet
jerrold
and
anne
and
colin
as
they
set
the
for
pinkney
very
quiet
as
they
watched
pinkney
innocent
approach
the
sponge
caught
him
with
a
delightful
squelching
flump
full
and
fair
on
the
top
of
his
sleek
head
anne
shrieked
with
delight
oh
jerry
did
you
him
say
they
rushed
back
to
the
library
to
tell
eliot
but
eliot
could
see
that
it
was
funny
he
said
it
was
a
rotten
thing
to
do
when
he
a
servant
and
ca
do
anything
to
i
never
thought
of
that
said
jerrold
it
pretty
rotten
i
could
ask
him
to
bowl
to
me
and
let
him
get
me
out
he
do
that
in
any
case
still
i
have
him
but
it
seemed
that
pinkney
was
in
no
mood
to
think
of
cricket
and
they
had
to
be
content
with
begging
his
pardon
which
he
gave
as
he
said
freely
yet
it
struck
them
that
he
looked
sadder
than
a
should
have
made
him
it
was
just
before
that
eliot
told
them
the
awful
thing
i
suppose
you
know
he
said
that
pinkney
mother
dying
i
did
said
jerrold
but
i
might
have
known
i
notice
that
when
you
excited
excited
something
awful
bound
to
happen
do
cry
anne
it
was
beastly
of
us
but
we
did
know
no
it
no
use
crying
said
eliot
you
ca
do
anything
that
it
anne
sobbed
if
we
only
could
if
we
could
go
to
him
and
tell
him
we
would
have
done
it
if
we
known
you
jolly
well
ca
it
would
only
bother
the
poor
chap
besides
it
was
jerry
did
it
not
you
it
me
i
filled
the
sponge
we
did
it
together
what
they
had
done
was
beastly
setting
for
pinkney
and
laughing
at
him
when
his
mother
was
dying
but
they
had
done
it
together
the
pain
of
her
sin
had
sweetness
in
it
since
she
shared
it
with
jerry
jerry
arm
was
round
her
as
she
went
upstairs
to
bed
crying
they
sat
together
on
her
bed
holding
each
other
hands
they
faced
it
together
you
never
have
done
it
anne
if
i
had
made
you
i
would
mind
so
much
if
we
had
laughed
at
him
well
we
could
help
and
it
was
as
if
we
known
if
only
we
could
tell
him
we
ca
he
hate
us
to
go
talking
to
him
about
his
mother
he
hate
us
then
anne
had
an
idea
they
could
talk
to
pinkney
but
they
could
write
that
would
hurt
him
jerry
fetched
a
pencil
and
paper
from
the
schoolroom
and
anne
wrote
dear
pinkney
we
did
know
we
would
have
done
it
if
known
we
are
awfully
sorry
yours
truly
anne
severn
you
are
to
answer
this
jerrold
fielding
half
an
hour
later
jerrold
knocked
at
her
door
anne
are
you
in
bed
she
got
up
and
stood
with
him
at
the
door
in
her
innocent
nightgown
it
all
right
he
said
i
seen
pinkney
he
says
we
are
to
worry
he
knew
we
would
have
done
it
if
we
known
was
he
crying
no
laughing
all
the
same
it
be
a
lesson
to
us
he
said
xii
where
jerrold
robert
fielding
called
from
the
dogcart
that
waited
by
the
porch
eliot
sat
beside
him
very
stiff
and
straight
painfully
aware
of
his
mother
who
stood
on
the
flagged
path
below
and
made
yearning
faces
at
him
doing
her
best
at
this
last
moment
to
destroy
his
morale
colin
sat
behind
him
by
jerrold
place
tearful
but
excited
he
was
to
go
with
them
to
the
station
eliot
tried
hard
to
look
as
if
he
did
care
and
as
his
mother
said
he
succeeded
beautifully
it
was
the
end
of
the
holidays
adeline
you
might
see
where
jerrold
is
she
went
into
the
house
and
saw
anne
and
jerrold
coming
slowly
down
the
stairs
together
from
the
gallery
at
the
turn
they
stopped
and
looked
at
each
other
and
suddenly
he
had
her
in
his
arms
they
kissed
with
close
quick
kisses
and
then
stood
apart
listening
adeline
went
back
the
monkey
she
thought
and
i
who
told
her
she
did
know
how
to
do
it
jerrold
ran
out
very
red
in
the
face
and
defiant
he
gave
himself
to
his
mother
large
embrace
broke
from
it
and
climbed
into
the
dogcart
the
mare
bounded
forward
jerrold
and
eliot
raised
their
hats
shouted
and
were
gone
adeline
watched
while
the
long
lines
of
the
narrowed
on
them
till
the
dogcart
swung
out
between
the
pillars
of
the
park
gates
last
time
their
going
had
been
nothing
to
her
today
she
could
hardly
bear
it
she
wondered
why
she
turned
and
found
little
anne
standing
beside
her
they
moved
suddenly
apart
each
had
seen
the
other
tears
xiii
outside
colin
window
the
tree
rocked
in
the
wind
a
branch
brushed
backwards
and
forwards
it
tapped
on
the
pane
its
black
shadow
shook
on
the
grey
moonlit
wall
jerrold
empty
bed
showed
white
and
dreadful
in
the
moonlight
covered
with
a
sheet
colin
was
frightened
a
narrow
passage
divided
his
room
from
anne
the
doors
stood
open
he
called
anne
anne
a
light
thud
on
the
floor
of
anne
room
then
the
soft
padding
of
naked
feet
and
anne
stood
beside
him
in
her
white
nightgown
her
hair
rose
in
a
black
ruff
round
her
head
her
eyes
were
very
black
in
the
sharp
whiteness
of
her
face

clock

they
counted
the
strokes

on

with
her
knees
drawn
up
to
her
chin
and
her
arms
clasped
round

xiv
every
night
adeline
still
came
to
see
anne
in
bed
the
little
thing
had
left
off
pretending
to
be
asleep
she
lay
with
eyes
wide
open
yielding
sweetly
to
the
embrace
her
eyelids
lay
shut
slack
on
her
eyes
and
adeline
thought
she
really
asleep
the
little
lamb
better
not
touch
her
she
was
going
away
when
a
sound
stopped
her
a
sound
of
sobbing
anne
anne

crying
a
tremulous
of
breath
a
shaking
under
the
on
anne
white
cheek
the
black
eyelashes
were
parted
and
pointed
with
her
tears
she

been

long
time
adeline
knelt
down
her
face
against
anne
face

broke
out
again
savage
violent
adeline
held
her
close
and
let
the
storm
beat
itself
out
against
her
heart
you
ca
want

ii
adolescents
i
for
the
next
two
years
anne
came
again
and
again
staying
four
months
at
wyck
and
four
months
in
london
with
grandmamma
severn
and
aunt
emily
and
four
months
with
grandpapa
everitt
at
the
essex
farm
when
she
was
twelve
they
sent
her
to
school
in
switzerland
for
three
years
then
back
to
wyck
after
eight
months
of
london
and
essex
in
between
only
the
times
at
wyck
counted
for
anne
her
calendar
showed
them
clear
with
all
their
incidents
recorded
thick
black
lines
blotted
out
the
other
days
as
she
told
them
off
one
by
one
three
years
and
eight
months
were
scored
through
in
this
manner
anne
at
fifteen
was
a
tall
girl
with
long
hair
tied
in
a
big
black
bow
at
the
cape
of
her
neck
her
vague
nose
had
settled
into
the
line
that
made
her
the
dark
likeness
of
her
father
her
body
was
slender
but
solid
the
strong
white
neck
carried
her
head
high
with
the
poise
of
a
runner
she
looked
at
least
seventeen
in
her
coat
and
skirt
probably
she
would
look
much
older
for
another
fifteen
years
robert
fielding
stared
with
incredulity
at
this
figure
which
had
pursued
him
down
the
platform
at
wyck
and
now
seized
him
by
the
arm
is
it
is
it
anne
of
course
it
is
why
did
you
expect
me
i
think
i
expected
something
smaller
and
rather
less
i
not
i
the
same
as
ever
well
you
not
little
anne
any
more
she
squeezed
his
arm
hanging
on
it
in
her
old
loving
way
no
but
still
me
and
i
have
known
anywhere
what
with
my
grey
hair
i
love
your
grey
hair
it
made
him
handsome
more
lovable
than
ever
anne
loved
it
as
she
loved
his
face
tanned
and
tightened
by
sun
and
wind
the
long
lines
the
thin
kind
mouth
the
clear
greenish
brown
eyes
quick
and
kind
colin
stood
by
the
dogcart
in
the
station
yard
colin
was
changed
he
was
no
longer
the
excited
child
who
came
rushing
to
you
he
stood
for
you
to
come
to
him
serious
and
shy
his
child
face
was
passing
from
prettiness
to
a
fine
sombre
beauty
what
happened
to
he
all
different
is
he
wait
uncle
robert
said
till
you
seen
jerrold
oh
is
jerrold
going
to
be
different
too
i
afraid
he
a
little
different
i
do
care
she
said
he
him
she
wanted
to
come
back
and
find
everybody
and
everything
the
same
looking
exactly
as
she
had
left
them
what
they
had
once
been
for
her
they
must
always
be
they
drove
slowly
up
wyck
hill
the
meeting
overhead
made
a
green
tunnel
you
came
out
suddenly
into
the
sunlight
at
the
top
the
road
was
the
same
they
passed
by
the
unicorn
inn
and
the
post
office
through
the
narrow
crooked
street
with
the
church
and
churchyard
at
the
turn
and
so
into
the
grey
and
yellow
market
square
with
the
two
tall
elms
standing
up
on
the
little
green
in
the
corner
they
passed
the
queen
head
the
sign
hung
out
from
the
yellow
front
the
same
as
ever
next
came
the
fountain
and
the
four
forked
roads
by
the
signpost
then
the
dip
of
the
hill
to
the
left
and
the
grey
stone
pillars
of
the
park
gates
on
the
right
at
the
end
of
the
beech
avenue
she
saw
the
house
the
three
big
gables
of
the
front
the
little
gable
underneath
in
the
middle
jutting
out
over
the
porch
that
was
the
bay
of
aunt
she
used
to
lean
out
of
the
lattice
windows
and
call
to
the
children
in
the
garden
the
house
was
the
same
so
were
the
green
terraces
and
the
wide
yew
walls
and
the
great
peacocks
carved
out
of
the
yew
and
beyond
them
the
lawn
flowing
out
under
banks
of
clipped
yew
down
to
the
goldfish
pond
they
were
things
that
she
had
seen
again
and
again
in
sleep
and
memory
things
that
had
made
her
heart
ache
thinking
of
them
that
took
her
back
and
back
and
would
let
her
be
she
had
only
to
leave
off
what
she
was
doing
and
she
saw
them
they
swam
before
her
eyes
covering
the
swiss
mountains
the
flat
essex
fields
the
high
white
london
houses
they
waited
for
her
at
the
waking
end
of
dreams
she
had
found
them
again
a
gap
in
the
green
walls
led
into
the
flower
garden
and
there
down
the
path
between
tall
rows
of
phlox
and
larkspurs
and
anchusa
of
blue
heaped
on
blue
aunt
adeline
came
holding
up
a
tall
bunch
of
flowers
blue
on
her
white
gown
blue
on
her
own
and
blue
she
came
looking
like
a
beautiful
girl
the
same
the
same
anne
had
seen
her
in
dreams
walking
like
that
tall
among
the
tall
flowers
she
never
hurried
to
meet
you
hurrying
would
have
spoiled
the
beauty
of
her
movement
she
came
slowly
stopping
now
and
then
to
pluck
yet
another
of
the
blue
spires
robert
stood
still
in
the
path
to
watch
her
she
was
smiling
a
long
way
off
intensely
aware
of
him
is
anne
she
said
yes
auntie
anne
well
you
a
big
girl
are
you
she
kissed
her
three
times
and
smiled
looking
away
again
over
her
that
was
the
difference
between
aunt
adeline
and
uncle
robert
his
eyes
made
you
important
they
held
you
all
the
time
he
talked
to
you
when
he
smiled
it
was
for
you
altogether
and
not
for
himself
at
all
her
eyes
never
looked
at
you
long
her
smile
wandered
it
was
half
for
you
and
half
for
herself
for
something
she
was
thinking
of
that
was
you
what
have
you
done
with
your
father
she
said
i
was
to
tell
you
daddy
ever
so
sorry
but
he
ca
come
till
a
horrid
man
kept
him
on
business
oh
a
little
crisping
wave
went
over
aunt
adeline
face
a
wave
of
vexation
anne
saw
it
he
is
sorry
you
should
have
heard
him
damning
and
cursing
they
laughed
adeline
was
appeased
she
took
her
husband
arm
and
drew
him
to
herself
something
warm
and
secret
seemed
to
pass
between
them
anne
said
to
herself
that
how
people
look
without
finishing
her
thought
lest
she
should
feel
shut
out
he
turned
to
her
well
are
you
glad
to
be
back
again
anne
he
said
glad
i
never
glad
to
be
anywhere
else
i
been
counting
the
weeks
and
the
days
and
the
minutes
the
minutes
yes
in
the
train
they
had
come
up
on
to
the
flagged
terrace
anne
looked
round
her
where
jerrold
she
said
and
they
laughed
again
there
no
doubt
said
uncle
robert
about
it
being
the
same
anne
ii
a
day
passed
john
severn
had
come
he
was
to
stay
with
the
fieldings
for
the
last
weeks
of
his
leave
he
had
followed
adeline
from
the
hot
terrace
to
the
cool
library
when
she
wanted
the
sun
again
he
would
follow
her
out
robert
and
colin
were
down
at
the
manor
farm
eliot
was
in
the
schoolroom
reading
jerrold
and
anne
sat
together
on
the
grass
under
the
beech
trees
alone
they
had
got
over
the
shock
of
the
first
encounter
when
they
met
at
arms
length
not
kissing
but
each
remembering
shyly
that
they
used
to
kiss
if
they
had
not
got
over
the
difference
the
change
of
anne
from
a
child
to
a
big
girl
of
jerrold
from
a
big
boy
to
a
man
height
and
a
man
voice
it
was
because
in
some
obscure
way
that
difference
fascinated
them
the
great
thing
was
that
underneath
it
they
were
both
as
anne
said
the
same
i
do
know
what
i
have
done
jerrold
if
you
had
been
you
might
have
known
i
would
be
i
did
know
i
say
what
a
thundering
lot
of
hair
you
got
i
like
it
do
you
like
what
auntie
adeline
calls
my
new
nose
awfully
she
meditated
jerrold
do
you
remember
benjy
rather
dear
benjy
do
you
know
i
can
hardly
believe
i
here
i
never
thought
i
should
come
again
but
why
should
you
i
do
know
only
i
think
every
time
something
happen
to
prevent
me
i
afraid
of
being
ill
or
dying
before
i
can
get
away
and
they
might
send
me
anywhere
any
day
it
awful
to
be
so
uncertain
do
think
about
it
you
here
now
oh
jerrold
supposing
it
was
the
last
time
it
is
the
last
time
do
spoil
it
by
thinking
think
if
you
were
me
i
say
you
do
mean
they
not
decent
to
you
who
grandmamma
and
grandpapa
they
perfect
darlings
so
aunt
emily
but
they
awfully
old
and
they
ca
play
at
anything
except
bridge
and
it
is
the
same
thing
at
all
besides
i
do
she
paused
it
was
kind
to
the
poor
things
to
say
i
do
love
them
the
same
do
you
like
us
so
awfully
then
yes
i
glad
you
like
us
they
were
silent
up
and
down
the
flagged
terrace
above
them
aunt
adeline
and
uncle
robert
walked
together
the
sound
of
his
voice
came
to
them
low
and
troubled
anne
listened
is
anything
wrong
she
said
they
been
like
that
for
ages
daddy
bothered
about
eliot
eliot
about
his
wanting
to
be
a
doctor
is
auntie
adeline
bothered
no
she
would
be
if
she
knew
but
she
does
think
it
happen
she
never
thinks
anything
will
happen
that
she
does
like
but
it
will
they
ca
keep
him
off
it
he
been
doing
medicine
at
cambridge
because
they
wo
let
him
go
and
do
it
at
bart
it
just
come
out
that
he
been
at
it
all
the
time
working
like
blazes
why
should
he
be
a
doctor
if
he
likes
because
he
the
eldest
son
it
would
matter
so
much
if
it
was
only
colin
or
me
but
eliot
ought
to
have
the
estate
and
he
says
he
have
it
he
does
want
it
he
says
daddy
got
to
leave
it
to
me
that
what
worrying
the
dear
old
thing
he
thinks
it
would
be
fair
who
to
jerrold
laughed
why
to
he
got
it
into
his
dear
old
head
that
he
to
have
it
he
ca
see
that
eliot
knows
his
own
business
best
it
be
most
awfully
in
his
way
it
pretty
beastly
for
me
too
i
do
like
taking
it
when
i
know
daddy
wants
eliot
to
have
it
that
to
say
he
want
he
like
me
to
have
it
because
i
take
care
of
it
but
that
makes
him
all
the
more
stuck
on
eliot
because
he
thinks
it
the
right
thing
i
do
like
having
it
in
any
case
why
ever
not
well
i
only
have
it
if
daddy
dies
and
i
rather
die
myself
first
that
how
i
feel
about
my
farm
beastly
is
it
still
i
not
worrying
daddy
frightfully
healthy
thank
heaven
he
live
to
be
eighty
at
the
very
least
why
i
should
be
fifty
all
right
said
anne
but
it
awful
for
me
grandpapa
might
die
any
day
he
it
be
ages
before
fifty
and
i
may
never
be
it
india
may
polish
me
off
long
before
that
he
laughed
his
happy
laugh
the
idea
of
his
own
death
seemed
to
jerrold
irresistibly
funny
he
laughed
again
at
her
dismay
rather
i
going
in
for
the
indian
civil
oh
jerrold
you
be
away
years
and
years
nearly
all
the
time
like
daddy
and
i
sha
ever
see
you
i
sha
start
for
ages
not
for
five
years
lots
of
time
to
see
each
other
in
lots
of
time
for
seeing
each
other
ever
again
she
sat
staring
mournfully
seeing
before
her
the
agony
of
separation
nonsense
said
jerrold
why
on
earth
should
you
come
out
to
india
too
i
say
that
would
be
a
lark
would
it
you
would
come
you
like
a
shot
said
anne
would
you
give
up
your
farm
to
come
i
give
up
anything
all
right
let
go
and
play
tennis
they
played
for
two
hours
straight
on
end
laughing
and
shouting
adeline
intensely
bored
by
eliot
and
his
absurd
affairs
came
down
the
lawn
to
look
at
them
she
loved
their
laughter
it
was
good
to
have
anne
there
anne
was
so
happy
john
severn
came
to
her
did
you
ever
see
anything
happier
than
that
absurd
boy
she
said
why
ca
eliot
be
jolly
and
contented
too
like
jerrold
do
you
think
the
chief
reason
may
be
that
he
jerrold
jerrold
adorable
he
never
given
me
a
day
trouble
since
he
was
born
no
it
other
women
he
give
trouble
to
said
john
before
done
iii
colin
was
playing
all
afternoon
he
had
been
practising
with
fury
first
scales
then
exercises
then
a
pause
and
now
his
fingers
slipped
into
the
first
movement
of
the
waldstein
sonata
secretly
mysteriously
he
began
then
broke
sharply
impatiently
crescendo
as
the
passion
of
the
music
mounted
up
and
up
and
now
as
it
settled
into
its
rhythm
his
hands
ran
smoothly
and
joyously
along
the
west
window
of
the
was
open
to
the
terrace
eliot
and
anne
sat
out
there
and
listened
he
wonderful
is
he
she
said
eliot
shook
his
head
not
so
wonderful
as
he
was
not
half
so
wonderful
as
he
ought
to
be
he
never
be
good
enough
for
a
professional
he
knows
he
wo
what
happened
nothing
that
just
it
nothing
ever
will
happen
he
stuck
it
the
same
with
his
singing
he
never
be
any
good
if
he
ca
go
away
and
study
somewhere
if
it
is
berlin
or
leipzig
it
ought
to
be
london
but
father
ca
live
there
and
the
mater
wo
go
anywhere
without
him
so
poor
got
to
stick
here
doing
nothing
with
the
same
rotten
old
masters
telling
him
things
he
knew
years
ago
it
be
worse
next
term
when
he
goes
to
cheltenham
he
wo
be
able
to
practice
and
nobody
care
a
damn
not
that
that
would
matter
if
he
cared
himself
colin
was
playing
the
slow
movement
now
the
grave
pure
passion
pressed
out
from
the
solemn
bass
throbbed
tense
with
restraint
oh
eliot
he
care
in
a
way
not
enough
to
keep
on
at
it
you
got
to
slog
like
blazes
if
you
want
to
get
on
jerrold
wo
ever
then
oh
yes
he
will
get
on
all
right
because
he
care
because
work
comes
so
jolly
easy
to
him
he
has
got
to
break
his
heart
over
it
the
trouble
with
colin
is
that
he
cares
awfully
for
such
a
lot
of
other
things
us
for
instance
he
leave
off
in
the
middle
of
a
movement
if
he
hears
jerrold
yelling
for
him
he
ought
to
be
able
to
chuck
us
all
we
all
of
us
in
his
way
he
ought
to
hate
us
he
ought
to
hate
jerrold
worst
of
all
adeline
and
john
severn
came
round
the
corner
of
the
terrace
what
all
this
about
hating
he
said
what
do
you
mean
eliot
said
she
eliot
raised
himself
wearily

said

prepared
to
commit
a
crime
for

v
the
sun
had
come
round
on
to
the
terrace
adeline
rose
from
her
chair
john
severn
rose
stiffly
she
had
made
him
go
with
her
to
the
goldfish
pond
made
him
walk
round
the
garden
listening
to
him
and
not
listening
detaching
herself
wilfully
at
every
turn
to
gather
more
and
more
of
her
blue
flowers
made
him
come
into
the
and
look
on
while
she
arranged
them
exquisitely
in
the
tall
chinese
jars
she
had
brought
him
out
again
to
sit
on
the
terrace
in
the
sun
and
now
in
her
restlessness
she
was
up
again
and
calling
to
him
to
follow
it
baking
here
shall
we
go
into
the
library
if
you
like
he
sighed
as
he
said
it
as
long
as
they
stayed
out
of
doors
he
felt
safe
and
peaceful
but
he
was
afraid
of
the
library
once
there
shut
in
with
her
in
that
room
which
she
was
consecrating
to
their
communion
heaven
only
knew
what
sort
of
fool
he
might
make
of
himself
last
time
it
was
only
the
sudden
entrance
of
robert
that
had
prevented
some
such
manifestation
and
her
smile
and
her
attentive
attitude
told
him
that
she
expected
him
to
be
a
fool
that
she
looked
to
his
folly
for
her
entertainment
he
had
followed
her
like
a
dog
and
as
if
he
had
been
a
dog
her
hand
patted
a
place
on
the
couch
beside
her
and
because
he
was
a
fool
and
foredoomed
he
took
it
there
was
a
silence
then
suddenly
he
made
up
his
mind
adeline
i
very
sorry
but
i
find
i
got
to
go

up
to

he
paused
brooding
wrenching
one
of
his
lean
hands
with
the
other
there
one
thing

must
ask
you

poor
dears

to
them
none
of
us

these
awful
things
if

at
her
tell
you

know
why
i
am
going
for
same
that

possibly
ask

if
you
feel
like
that
about
it
you
say
i
no
business
to
come
if
i

but
i

anybody
but
robert
never
never
for
a
minute
i
tell
you
i
know
that
i
always
have
known

and
i
understand
it
what
i
ca
understand

that
that
you
make
it
so
hard
for
me
do
i
make
it
hard
for
you
damnably
you
poor
thing
but
you
get
over
it
i
not
young
enough
to
get
over
it
does
it
look
like
getting
over
it
it
been
going
on
for
years
oh
come
not
all
the
time
john
pretty
nearly
on
and
off
more
off
than
on
i
think
what
does
that
matter
when
it
now
anyhow
i
got
to
go
go
if
you
must
do
the
best
for
yourself
my
dear
only
do
say
i
made
you
i
not
saying
anything
well
i
sorry
all
the
same
her
smile
declared
her
profound
and
triumphant
satisfaction
with
herself
it
remained
with
her
after
he
had
gone
she
would
rather
he
had
stayed
following
her
about
waiting
for
her
ready
to
her
call
amusing
her
but
his
going
was
the
finer
tribute
to
her
power
the
finest
perhaps
that
he
could
have
well
paid
she
had
been
prepared
for
such
a
complete
surrender
vi
something
had
happened
to
eliot
he
sulked
indoors
and
out
working
and
playing
at
and
he
sulked
jerrold
said
of
him
that
he
sulked
in
his
sleep
two
things
made
his
behaviour
inexplicable
to
begin
with
it
was
uncalled
for
robert
fielding
urged
by
john
severn
in
a
last
interview
had
given
in
all
along
the
line
not
only
had
eliot
leave
to
stick
to
his
medicine
which
he
would
have
done
in
any
case
but
he
was
to
go
to
bart
to
work
for
his
doctor
degree
when
his
three
years
at
cambridge
were
ended
his
father
had
made
a
new
will
leaving
the
estate
to
jerrold
and
securing
to
the
eldest
son
an
income
almost
large
enough
to
make
up
for
the
loss
eliot
whose
ultimate
aim
was
research
work
now
saw
all
the
ways
before
him
cleared
he
had
no
longer
anything
to
sulk
for
still
more
mysteriously
his
sulking
appeared
to
be
related
to
anne
he
had
left
off
going
for
walks
alone
with
her
in
the
fields
and
woods
he
did
show
her
things
under
his
microscope
any
more
if
she
leaned
over
his
shoulder
he
writhed
himself
away
if
his
hand
blundered
against
hers
he
drew
it
back
as
if
her
touch
burnt
him
more
often
than
not
he
would
go
out
of
the
room
if
she
came
into
it
yet
as
long
as
she
was
there
he
could
keep
his
eyes
off
her
she
would
be
sitting
still
reading
when
she
would
be
aware
again
and
again
of
eliot
eyes
lifted
from
his
book
to
fasten
on
her
she
could
feel
them
following
her
when
she
walked
away
one
wet
day
in
august
they
were
alone
together
in
the
schoolroom
reading
suddenly
anne
felt
his
eyes
on
her
their
look
was
intent
penetrating
disturbing
it
burned
at
her
under
his
jutting
sombre
eyebrows
is
there
anything
funny
about
me
she
said
funny
no
why
because
you
keep
on
looking
at
me
i
did
know
i
was
looking
at
you
well
you
were
you
always
doing
it
and
i
ca
think
why
it
is
because
i
want
to
he
held
his
book
up
so
that
it
hid
his
face
then
do
do
it
she
said
you
need
i
sha
he
snarled
savagely
behind
his
screen
but
he
did
it
again
and
again
as
if
for
the
life
of
him
he
help
it
there
was
something
about
it
mysterious
and
exciting
it
made
anne
want
to
look
at
eliot
when
he
was
looking
at
her
she
liked
his
blunt
clever
face
the
likeness
of
his
with
its
jutting
eyebrows
and
jutting
chin
its
fine
grave
mouth
and
eyes
mouth
and
eyes
that
had
once
been
so
kind
and
were
now
so
queer
eliot
face
made
her
keep
on
wondering
what
it
was
doing
she
to
look
at
it
one
day
when
she
was
looking
their
eyes
met
she
had
just
time
to
see
that
his
mouth
had
softened
as
if
he
were
pleased
to
find
her
looking
at
him
and
his
eyes
were
different
not
cross
but
dark
now
and
unhappy
they
made
her
feel
as
if
she
had
hurt
him
they
were
in
the
library
uncle
robert
was
there
sitting
in
his
chair
behind
them
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
room
she
had
forgotten
uncle
robert
oh
eliot
she
said
have
i
done
anything
not
that
i
know
of
his
face
stiffened
you
look
as
if
i
had
have
i
do
talk
such
putrid
rot
as
if
i
cared
what
you
did
ca
you
leave
me
alone
and
he
jumped
up
and
left
the
room
and
there
was
uncle
robert
in
his
chair
watching
her
looking
kind
and
sorry
what
the
matter
with
him
she
said
why
is
he
so
cross
you
must
mind
he
does
mean
it
no
but
it
so
funny
of
him
he
only
cross
with
me
and
i
done
anything
it
is
that
what
is
it
then
i
believe
he
hates
me
no
he
does
hate
you
anne
he
going
through
a
bad
time
all
he
ca
help
being
cross
why
ca
he
he
got
everything
he
wants
has
he
uncle
robert
was
smiling
and
this
time
his
smile
was
for
himself
she
did
understand
it
vii
anne
was
going
away
she
said
she
supposed
now
that
eliot
would
be
happy
grandmamma
severn
thought
she
had
been
long
enough
running
loose
with
those
fielding
boys
grandpapa
everitt
agreed
with
her
and
they
decided
that
in
september
anne
should
go
to
the
big
girls
college
in
cheltenham
grandmamma
and
aunt
emily

anne

room
it

a
chilly
day
in
september

colin
was
in
bed
surrounded
by
hot
water
bottles
he
had
tried
to
follow
jerrold
in
his
big
jump
across
the
river
and
had
fallen
in
he
was
not
ill
but
he
hoped
he
would
be
for
then
he
could
go
back

for
the
hot
water
bottles

get
his
chill

when
the
day

i
glad

you
sometimes
so
i
oh
jerrold
here
the
beastly
train
it
drew
up
along
the
platform
anne
stood
in
her
carriage
leaning
out
of
the
window
to
him
his
hand
was
on
the
ledge
they
looked
at
each
other
without
speaking
the
guard
whistled
carriage
doors
slammed
one
after
another
the
train
moved
forward
jerrold
ran
alongside
i
say
you
let
play
on
that
piano
anne
was
gone
iii
anne
and
jerrold
i
have
you
been
all
the
day
rendal
my
son
where
have
you
been
all
the
day
my
pretty
one
five
years
had
passed
it
was
august
nineteen
ten
anne
had
come
again
she
sat
out
on
the
terrace
with
adeline
while
colin
song
drifted
out
to
them
through
the
open
window
it
was
her
first
day
the
first
time
for
three
years
anne
calendar
was
blank
from
nineteen
seven
to
nineteen
ten
when
she
was
seventeen
she
had
left
cheltenham
and
gone
to
live
with
grandpapa
everitt
at
the
essex
farm
grandpapa
everitt
wanted
her
more
than
grandmamma
severn
who
had
aunt
emily
so
anne
had
stayed
with
him
all
that
time
she
had
spent
it
learning
to
farm
and
looking
after
grandpapa
on
his
bad
days
for
the
last
year
of
his
life
all
his
days
had
been
bad
now
he
was
dead
dead
three
months
ago
and
anne
had
the
farm
she
was
going
to
train
for
five
years
under
the
man
who
had
worked
it
for
grandpapa
after
that
she
meant
to
manage
it
herself
she
had
been
trying
to
tell
aunt
adeline
all
about
it
but
you
could
see
she
was
interested
she
kept
on
saying
yes
and
oh
and
really
in
the
wrong
places
she
never
could
listen
to
you
for
long
together
and
this
afternoon
she
was
evidently
thinking
of
something
else
perhaps
of
john
severn
who
had
been
home
on
leave
and
gone
again
without
coming
to
the
fieldings
been
to
my
sweetheart
mother
make
my
bed
soon
for
i
sick
to
my
heart
and
i
fain
would
lie
down
mournful
and
beautiful
colin
song
came
through
the
windows
and
anne
thought
of
jerrold
who
was
not
there
he
was
staying
in
yorkshire
with
some
friends
of
his
the
durhams

would

punjaub

government
official

be
useful
to
jerrold
if
he
gets
a
job

have
to
ask
maisie
durham

sail

durham
but
he
would
have
got

they
be
do
look
at
me
as
if
i

i
was
thinking
of
you
ducky
you
might
tell
pinkney
to
take
those
off
the
terrace
and
put
them
into
the
lounge
ii
the
stood
in
a
half
ring
at
the
top
of
the
highest
field
jerrold
had
come
back
he
and
anne
sat
in
the
bay
of
the
beeches
looking
out
over
the
hills
curve
after
curve
of
hills
rolling
together
flung
off
from
each
other
an
endless
undulation
rounded
heads
carrying
a
clump
of
trees
like
a
comb
long
steep
groins
packed
with
raking
necks
with
stiff
plantations
slopes
that
spread
out
opened
wide
wings
an
immense
stretching
and
flattening
of
arcs
up
to
the
straight
blue
wall
on
the
horizon
a
band
of
trees
stood
up
there
like
a
hedge
calm
clean
spaces
emerging
the
bright
pattern
of
the
fields
squares
and
fans
and
pointed
triangles
close
fitted
emerald
green
of
the
turnips
yellow
of
the
charlock
lifted
high
and
clear
red
brown
and
pink
and
purple
of
ploughed
land
and
fallows
red
gold
of
the
wheat
and
white
green
of
the
barley
shimmering
in
a
wash
of
thin
air
where
anne
and
jerrold
sat
green
pastures
bitten
smooth
by
the
sheep
flowed
down
below
them
in
long
ridges
like
waves
on
the
right
the
bright
canary
coloured
charlock
brimmed
the
field
its
flat
vanilla
and
almond
scent
came
to
them
what
yorkshire
like
not
a
patch
on
this
place
i
ca
think
what
there
is
about
it
that
makes
you
feel
so
jolly
happy
but
you
always
be
happy
jerrold
anywhere
not
like
that
i
mean
a
queer
uncanny
feeling
that
you
sort
of
make
out
i
know
i
know
there
nothing
on
earth
that
gets
you
like
the
smell
of
charlock
anne
tilted
up
her
nose
and
sniffed
delicately
fancy
seeing
this
country
suddenly
for
the
first
time
he
said
there
such
a
lot
of
it
you
would
see
it
properly
it
takes
ages
just
to
tell
one
hill
from
another
he
looked
at
her
she
could
feel
him
meditating
considering
i
say
i
wonder
what
it
would
feel
like
seeing
each
other
for
the
first
time
not
half
so
nice
as
seeing
each
other
now
why
we
should
remember
any
of
the
jolly
things
we
done
together
he
had
seen
maisie
durham
for
the
first
time
she
wondered
whether
that
had
made
him
think
of
it
no
but
the
effect
might
be
rather
stunning
i
mean
of
seeing
it
would
and
you
be
nothing
but
a
big
man
with
a
face
i
rather
liked
i
suppose
i
should
like
your
face
we
should
each
other
jerrold
no
more
we
should
it
would
be
like
not
knowing
dad
or
mummy
or
colin
a
thing
you
ca
conceive
it
would
be
like
not
knowing
anything
at
all
of
course
the
best
thing
would
be
both
both
knowing
each
other
and
not
knowing
you
ca
have
it
both
ways
he
said
oh
ca
you
you
do
half
know
me
as
it
is
and
i
do
half
know
you
we
might
both
do
anything
any
day
things
that
would
make
each
other
jump
what
sort
of
things
that
the
exciting
part
of
it
we
would
know
i
believe
you
anne
make
me
jump
wait
till
i
get
out
to
india
you
really
going
really
going
daddy
may
send
for
me
any
day
i
may
be
sent
there
then
we
go
out
together
will
maisie
durham
be
going
too
o
lord
no
not
with
us
at
least
i
hope
not
poor
little
maisie
i
was
a
beast
to
say
that
is
she
little
no
rather
big
but
you
think
of
her
as
little
only
i
do
think
of
her
they
stood
up
they
stood
close
looking
at
each
other
laughing
as
he
laughed
his
eyes
took
her
in
from
head
to
feet
wondering
admiring
anne
face
and
body
had
the
same
forward
springing
look
in
their
very
stillness
they
somehow
suggested
movement
her
young
breasts
sprang
forwards
sharp
pointed
her
eyes
had
no
sliding
corner
glances
he
was
for
ever
aware
of
anne
face
turning
on
its
white
neck
to
look
at
him
straight
and
full
her
eyes
shining
and
darkening
and
shining
under
the
long
black
brushes
of
her
eyebrows
even
her
nose
expressed
movement
a
sort
of
rhythm
it
rose
in
a
slender
arch
raked
straight
forward
dipped
delicately
and
rose
again
in
a
delicately
questing
tilt
this
tilt
had
the
delightful
air
of
catching
up
and
shortening
the
curl
of
her
upper
lip
the
exquisite
lower
one
sprang
forward
sharp
and
salient
from
the
little
dent
above
her
innocent
rounded
chin
its
edge
curled
slightly
forward
in
a
line
firm
as
ivory
and
fine
as
the
edge
of
a
flower
as
long
as
he
lived
he
would
remember
the
way
of
it
and
she
she
was
aware
of
his
body
slender
and
tense
under
his
white
flannels
it
seemed
to
throb
with
the
power
it
held
in
prisoned
in
the
smooth
tight
muscles
his
eyes
showed
the
colour
of
dark
hyacinths
set
in
his
clear
skin
he
smiled
down
at
her
and
his
mouth
and
little
fawn
brown
moustache
followed
the
tilted
shadow
of
his
nostrils
suddenly
her
whole
body
quivered
as
if
his
had
touched
it
and
when
she
looked
at
him
she
had
the
queer
feeling
that
she
saw
him
for
the
first
time
never
before
like
that
never
before
but
to
him
she
was
the
same
anne
he
knew
her
face
as
he
knew
his
mother
face
or
colin
he
knew
he
remembered
all
her
ways
and
this
was
not
what
he
wanted
he
wanted
some
strange
wonder
and
excitement
he
wanted
to
find
it
in
anne
and
in
nobody
but
anne
and
he
could
find
it
he
wanted
to
be
in
love
with
anne
and
he
was
she
was
too
near
him
too
much
a
part
of
him
too
too
she
made
him
restless
and
impatient
looking
looking
for
the
strangeness
the
mystery
he
wanted
and
could
find
if
only
he
could
have
seen
her
suddenly
for
the
first
time
iii
it
was
extraordinary
how
happy
it
made
her
to
be
with
aunt
adeline
walking
slowly
slowly
with
her
round
the
garden
stretched
out
beside
her
on
the
terrace
following
her
abrupt
moves
from
the
sun
into
the
shade
and
back
again
or
sitting
for
hours
with
her
in
the
big
darkened
bedroom
when
adeline
had
one
of
the
bad
headaches
that
attacked
her
now
brushing
her
hair
and
putting
handkerchiefs
soaked
in
on
her
hot
forehead
extraordinary
because
this
inactivity
did
violence
to
anne
nature
besides
auntie
adeline
behaved
as
if
you
were
uninteresting
and
unimportant
not
attending
to
a
word
you
said
yet
her
strength
lay
in
her
inconsistency
one
minute
her
arrogance
ignored
you
and
the
next
she
came
humbly
and
begged
for
your
caresses
she
was
dependent
like
a
child
on
your
affection
anne
thought
that
pathetic
and
there
was
always
her
fascination
that
was
absolute
above
logic
and
morality
irrefutable
as
the
sweetness
of
a
flower
everybody
felt
it
even
the
servants
whom
she
tormented
with
her
incalculable
wants
jerrold
and
colin
even
eliot
now
that
he
was
felt
it
as
for
uncle
robert
he
was
like
a
young
man
in
the
beginning
of
first
love
adeline
judged
people
by
their
attitude
to
her
anne
whether
she
listened
to
her
or
not
was
her
own
darling
her
husband
and
john
severn
were
adorable
major
markham
of
wyck
wold
and
hawtrey
of
medlicote
who
admired
her
were
perfect
dears
sir
john
corbett
of
underwoods
who
did
was
that
silly
old
thing
resist
her
and
she
felt
no
mean
resentment
you
simply
dropped
out
of
her
scene
thus
her
world
was
peopled
with
her
adorers
anne
could
have
told
you
whether
she
felt
the
charm
on
its
own
account
or
whether
the
pleasure
of
being
with
her
was
simply
part
of
the
blessed
state
of
being
at
enough
that
auntie
adeline
was
there
where
uncle
robert
and
eliot
and
colin
and
jerrold
were
she
belonged
to
them
she
belonged
to
the
house
and
garden
she
stood
with
the
flowers
anne
was
walking
with
her
now
gathering
roses
for
the
house
the
garden
was
like
a
room
shut
in
by
the
clipped
yew
walls
and
open
to
the
sky
the
sunshine
poured
into
it
the
flagged
walks
were
pale
with
heat
anne
cat
nicky
was
there
the
black
persian
that
jerrold
had
given
her
last
birthday
he
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
path
on
his
haunches
his
forelegs
straight
and
stiff
planted
together
his
face
had
a
look
of
sweet
and
solemn
meditation
oh
nicky
oh
you
darling
she
said
when
she
stroked
him
he
got
up
arching
his
back
and
carrying
his
tail
in
a
flourishing
curve
like
one
side
of
a
lyre
he
rubbed
against
her
ankles
a
white
butterfly
flickered
among
the
blue
larkspurs
when
nicky
saw
it
he
danced
on
his
hind
legs
clapping
his
forepaws
as
he
tried
to
catch
it
but
the
butterfly
was
too
quick
for
him
anne
picked
him
up
and
he
flattened
himself
against
her
breast
butting
under
her
chin
with
his
smooth
round
head
in
his
loving
way
and
as
adeline
would
listen
to
her
anne
talked
to
the
cat
clever
little
thing
he
sees
everything
all
the
butterflies
and
the
and
the
do
you
my
pretty
one
what
the
good
of
talking
to
the
cat
said
adeline
he
understand
a
word
you
say
he
does
understand
the
words
he
says
but
he
feels
the
feeling
he
was
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
pussies
he
was
he
was
nonsense
you
throwing
yourself
away
on
that
absurd
animal
for
all
the
affection
you
get
out
of
him
i
shall
get
out
just
what
i
put
in
he
expects
to
be
talked
to
so
do
i
i
been
trying
to
talk
to
you
all
afternoon
and
you
wo
listen
and
you
do
know
how
you
can
hurt
nicky
feelings
he
miserable
if
i
do
tell
him
he
a
beautiful
pussy
the
minute
he
comes
into
my
room
he
creeps
away
under
the
washstand
and
broods
we
take
these
darling
things
and
give
them
little
souls
and
hearts
and
we
no
business
to
hurt
them
and
they
such
a
tiny
time
to
live
too
look
at
him
sitting
up
to
be
carried
like
a
child
oh
wait
my
dear
till
you
a
child
you
ridiculous
baby
oh
come
jerrold
every
bit
as
gone
on
him
you
a
ridiculous
pair
said
adeline
if
nicky
purred
round
legs
you
love
him
too
said
anne
iv
uncle
robert
was
not
well
he
could
eat
the
things
he
used
to
eat
he
had
to
have
fish
or
chicken
and
milk
and
and
benger
food
jerrold
said
it
was
only
indigestion
and
he
be
all
right
in
a
day
or
two
but
you
could
see
by
the
way
he
walked
now
that
there
was
something
quite
dreadfully
wrong
he
went
slowly
slowly
as
if
every
step
tired
him
out
sorry
jerrold
to
be
so
slow
but
jerrold
would
see
it
they
had
gone
down
to
the
manor
farm
he
and
jerrold
and
anne
he
wanted
to
show
jerrold
the
prize
stock
and
what
heifers
they
could
breed
from
next
year
i
should
keep
on
with
the
short
horns
you
ca
do
better
he
said
then
they
had
gone
up
the
fields
to
see
if
the
wheat
was
ready
for
cutting
yet
and
he
had
kept
on
telling
jerrold
what
crops
were
to
be
sown
after
the
wheat
swedes
to
come
first
and
vetch
after
the
swedes
to
crowd
out
the
charlock
you
have
to
keep
the
charlock
down
jerrold
or
it
kill
the
crops
you
have
the
devil
of
a
job
he
spoke
as
though
jerrold
had
the
land
already
and
he
was
telling
him
the
things
he
wanted
him
to
remember
they
came
back
up
the
steep
pasture
very
slowly
uncle
robert
leaning
on
jerrold
arm
they
sat
down
to
rest
under
the
at
the
top
they
looked
at
the
landscape
the
hills
rolling
together
flung
off
from
each
other
an
endless
undulation
beautiful
country
beautiful
country
said
uncle
robert
as
if
he
had
never
seen
it
before
you
should
see
farm
anne
said
it
as
flat
as
a
and
all
squeezed
up
by
the
horrid
town
grandpapa
sold
a
lot
of
it
for
building
i
wish
i
could
sell
the
rest
and
buy
a
farm
in
the
cotswolds
do
you
ever
have
farms
to
sell
uncle
robert
well
not
to
sell
to
let
perhaps
if
a
tenant
goes
you
can
have
the
barrow
farm
when
old
sutton
dies
he
ca
last
long
but
he
went
on
you
find
it
very
different
farming
here
how
different
well
in
some
of
those
fields
you
have
to
fight
the
charlock
all
the
time
and
in
some
the
soil
hard
and
in
some
you
got
to
plough
across
the
sun
because
of
the
slope
of
the
land
remember
jerrold
anne
to
have
the
barrow
farm
if
she
wants
it
when
sutton
dies
jerrold
laughed
my
dear
father
i
shall
be
in
india
i
remind
you
uncle
robert
uncle
robert
smiled
i
tell
barker
to
remember
he
said
barker
was
his
agent
it
was
as
if
he
were
thinking
that
when
sutton
died
he
might
not
be
there
and
he
had
said
that
sutton
would
last
long
anne
looked
at
jerrold
but
jerrold
face
was
happy
he
did
see
it
they
left
uncle
robert
in
the
library
drinking
hot
water
for
tea
jerrold
anne
said
i
sure
uncle
robert
oh
no
it
only
indigestion
he
be
as
right
as
rain
in
a
day
or
two
v
anne
cat
nicky
was
dying
jerrold
struggled
with
his
sleep
pushing
it
back
and
back
before
him
trying
to
remember
there
was
something
something
that
had
hung
over
him
the
night
before
he
had
been
afraid
to
wake
and
find
it
there
something
now
he
remembered
nicky
was
dying
and
anne
was
unhappy
that
was
what
it
was
that
was
what
he
had
hated
to
wake
to
anne
unhappiness
and
the
little
cat
there
was
nothing
else
nothing
wrong
with
daddy
only
indigestion
he
had
had
it
before
the
room
was
still
dark
but
the
leaded
squares
of
the
window
lattices
barred
a
sky
pale
with
dawn
in
her
room
across
the
passage
anne
would
be
sitting
up
with
nicky
he
remembered
now
that
he
had
to
get
up
early
to
make
her
some
tea
he
lit
a
candle
and
went
to
her
door
to
see
if
she
were
still
awake
her
voice
answered
his
gentle
tapping
who
there
me
jerrold
may
i
come
in
yes
but
do
bring
the
light
in
he
sleeping
he
put
out
the
candle
and
made
his
way
to
her
against
the
window
panes
he
could
see
the
outline
of
her
body
sitting
upright
in
a
chair
she
glimmered
there
in
her
white
wrapper
and
he
made
out
something
black
stretched
straight
and
still
in
her
lap
he
sat
down
in
the
and
watched
the
room
was
mysterious
full
of
dusk
air
that
thinned
as
the
dawn
stirred
in
it
palpably
waking
first
anne
white
bed
a
strip
of
white
cornice
and
a
sheet
of
watery
nicky
saucer
of
milk
gleamed
white
on
the
dark
floor
at
anne
feet
the
pale
ceiling
lightened
and
with
a
sliding
shimmer
of
polished
curves
the
furniture
rose
up
from
the
walls
presently
it
stood
clear
shining
in
the
strange
pure
light
and
in
the
strange
pure
light
he
saw
anne
in
her
white
wrapper
with
the
great
rope
of
her
black
hair
plaited
hanging
down
her
back
the
little
black
cat
lay
in
her
white
lap
supported
by
her
arm
she
smiled
at
jerrold
strangely
she
spoke
and
her
voice
was
low
and
strange
he
asleep
jerry
he
kept
on
looking
at
me
and
mewing
then
he
tried
to
climb
into
my
lap
and
could
and
i
took
him
up
and
he
was
quiet
then
i
think
he
was
pleased
that
i
took
him
i
given
him
the
morphia
pill
and
i
do
think
he
in
pain
he
die
in
his
sleep
yes
he
die
in
his
sleep
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
saying
he
was
looking
at
anne
and
it
was
as
if
now
at
last
he
saw
her
for
the
first
time
this
this
was
what
he
wanted
this
mysterious
strangely
smiling
anne
this
white
anne
with
the
great
plaited
rope
of
black
hair
who
belonged
to
the
night
and
the
dawn
i
going
to
get
you
some
tea
he
said
he
went
down
to
the
kitchen
where
everything
had
been
left
ready
for
him
he
lit
the
and
made
the
tea
and
brought
it
to
her
with
cake
and
bread
and
butter
on
a
little
tray
he
set
it
down
beside
her
on
the
but
anne
could
neither
eat
nor
drink
she
cried
out
to
him
oh
jerry
look
at
him
do
you
think
he
dying
now
he
knelt
down
and
looked
nicky
eyes
were
two
slits
of
glaze
between
lids
his
fur
stood
up
on
his
bulging
frowning
forehead
his
little
flat
cat
face
was
drawn
to
a
point
with
a
look
of
helpless
innocence
and
anguish
his
tongue
showed
between
his
teeth
as
he
panted
yes
i
awfully
afraid
he
dying
they
waited
half
an
hour
an
hour
they
never
knew
how
long
once
he
said
to
her
would
you
rather
i
went
or
stayed
and
she
said
stayed
if
you
do
mind
through
the
open
window
from
the
fields
of
charlock
warm
in
the
risen
sun
the
faint
smooth
scent
came
to
them
then
nicky
began
to
cough
with
a
queer
quacking
sound
jerrold
went
to
her
upsetting
the
saucer
as
he
came
it
his
milk
she
said
he
could
drink
it
and
with
that
she
burst
into
tears
oh
anne
do
cry
do
cry
anne
darling
he
put
his
arm
round
her
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
hair
and
stroked
it
he
stooped
suddenly
and
kissed
her
face
gently
quietly
because
of
the
dead
thing
in
her
lap
it
was
as
if
he
had
kissed
her
for
the
first
time
for
one
instant
she
had
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
clung
to
him
hiding
her
face
on
his
shoulder
then
suddenly
she
loosed
herself
and
stood
up
before
him
holding
out
the
body
of
the
little
cat
take
him
away
please
jerry
so
that
i
do
see
him
he
took
him
away
all
day
the
sense
of
kissing
her
remained
with
him
and
all
night
with
the
scent
of
her
hair
the
sweet
of
her
flesh
the
touch
of
her
smooth
skin
that
was
anne
that
strangeness
that
beauty
of
the
clear
cold
dawn
that
scent
that
warm
sweet
smoothness
that
clinging
of
passionate
arms
and
he
had
kissed
her
gently
quietly
as
you
kiss
a
child
as
you
kiss
a
young
small
animal
he
wanted
to
kiss
her
close
pressing
down
on
her
mouth
deep
into
her
sweet
flesh
to
hold
her
body
tight
tight
crushed
in
his
arms
if
it
had
been
for
nicky
that
was
the
way
he
would
have
kissed
her
he
would
kiss
anne
that
way
iv
robert
i
but
when
came
he
did
not
kiss
her
he
was
annoyed
with
anne
because
she
insisted
on
taking
a
gloomy
view
of
his
father
illness
the
doctors
could
agree
about
it
ransome
of
wyck
said
it
was
gastritis
harper
of
cheltenham
said
it
was
colitis
he
had
had
that
before
and
had
got
better
now
he
was
getting
worse
fast
for
the
last
three
days
he
could
keep
down
his
chicken
and
fish
yesterday
not
even
his
milk
not
even
his
then
they
both
said
it
was
acute
gastritis
he
never
been
like
this
before
jerrold
no
but
that
does
mean
he
is
going
to
get
better
people
with
acute
gastritis
do
get
better
it
enough
to
make
him
die
everybody
insisting
that
he
going
to
and
it
rot
sending
for
eliot
that
was
what
anne
had
done
eliot
had
written
to
her
from
london
welbeck
my
dear
anne
i
wish
you
tell
me
how
father
really
is
nobody
but
you
has
any
intelligence
that
matters
between
mother
wails
and
jerrold
optimism
i
do
seem
to
be
getting
the
truth
if
serious
i
come
down
at
once
always
yours
eliot
and
anne
had
answered
my
dear
eliot
it
serious
ransome
and
harper
say
so
they
think
now
it
acute
gastritis
i
wish
you
come
down
jerrold
is
he
wo
see
it
because
he
could
bear
it
if
he
did
i
know
auntie
wants
you
always
very
affectionately
yours
anne
she
addressed
the
letter
to
eliot
fielding
for
eliot
had
taken
his
degree
and
on
that
of
jerrold
eliot
had
come
jerrold
told
him
he
was
a
perfect
idiot
rushing
down
like
that
as
if
daddy
had
an
hour
to
live
you
simply
terrify
him
he
said
he
has
got
a
chance
with
all
you
people
grousing
and
croaking
round
him
and
he
went
off
to
play
in
the
lawn
tennis
tournament
at
medlicote
as
a
protest
against
the
general
pessimism
his
idea
seemed
to
be
that
if
he
jerrold
could
play
in
a
lawn
tennis
tournament
his
father
could
be
seriously
it
perfectly
awful
of
jerrold
his
mother
said
i
ca
make
him
out
he
adores
his
father
yet
he
behaves
as
if
he
had
any
feeling
she
and
anne
were
sitting
in
the
lounge
after
luncheon
waiting
for
eliot
to
come
from
his
father
room
did
you
him
anne
i
did
everything
i
know
but
darling
he
is
unfeeling
he
does
it
because
he
ca
bear
to
think
uncle
robert
wo
get
better
trying
to
make
himself
believe
he
will
i
think
he
does
believe
it
but
if
he
stayed
away
from
the
tournament
that
would
mean
he
did
if
only
could
but
i
must
i
believe
it
if
i
not
to
go
mad
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
if
he
does
get
better
i
ca
live
without
him
it
been
so
perfect
anne
it
ca
come
to
an
end
like
this
it
ca
happen
it
would
be
too
cruel
it
would
anne
said
but
she
thought
it
just
will
happen
happening
now
here
eliot
she
said
eliot
came
down
the
stairs
adeline
went
to
him
oh
eliot
what
do
you
think
of
him
eliot
put
her
off
i
ca
tell
you
yet
you
think
he
very
bad
very
but
you
do
think
there
is
any
hope
i
ca
tell
yet
there
may
be
he
wants
you
to
go
to
him
do
talk
much
to
him
do
let
him
talk
and
do
whatever
you
do
let
him
move
an
inch
adeline
went
upstairs
anne
and
eliot
were
alone
you
tell
she
said
you
do
think
there
any
hope
i
do
there
something
quite
horribly
wrong
his
temperature
a
hundred
and
three
is
that
bad
very
i
do
wish
jerry
had
gone
so
do
i
it
be
worse
for
him
eliot
than
for
any
of
us
when
he
knows
i
know
but
he
always
been
like
that
as
long
as
i
can
remember
he
simply
ca
stand
trouble
it
the
only
thing
he
funks
and
his
funking
it
would
matter
if
he
stand
and
face
it
but
he
runs
away
he
running
away
now
say
what
you
like
it
a
sort
of
cowardice
it
his
only
fault
i
know
it
is
but
it
a
pretty
serious
one
anne
and
he
have
to
pay
for
it
the
world
chock
full
of
suffering
and
all
sorts
of
horrors
and
you
ca
go
turning
your
back
to
them
as
jerrold
does
without
paying
for
it
why
he
wo
face
anything
that
even
a
little
unpleasant
he
wo
listen
if
you
try
to
tell
him
he
wo
read
a
book
that
has
a
happy
ending
he
wo
go
to
a
play
that
is
a
comedy
it
an
attitude
i
ca
understand
i
do
like
horrors
any
more
than
he
does
but
when
i
hear
about
them
i
want
to
go
straight
where
they
are
and
do
something
to
stop
them

my
profession
for
i
know

in
she
had
every
appearance
of
running
away
from

it
from
where
she
drew
up
in
the
drive
at
medlicote
she
could
see
the
tennis
courts
she
could
see
jerrold
playing
in
the
men
singles
he
stood
up
to
the
net
smashing
down
the
ball
at
the
volley
his
back
was
turned
to
her
as
he
stood
she
heard
him
shout
she
heard
him
laugh
she
saw
him
turn
to
come
up
the
court
facing
her
and
when
he
saw
her
he
knew
ii
he
had
waited
ten
minutes
in
the
gallery
outside
his
father
room
eliot
had
asked
anne
to
go
in
and
help
him
while
jerrold
stood
by
the
door
to
keep
his
mother
out
she
was
no
good
eliot
said
she
lost
her
head
just
when
he
wanted
her
to
do
things
you
could
have
heard
her
all
over
the
house
crying
out
that
she
could
bear
it
she
opened
her
door
and
looked
out
when
she
saw
jerrold
she
came
to
him
slowly
supporting
herself
by
the
gallery
rail
her
eyes
were
sore
with
crying
and
there
was
a
flushed
thickening
about
the
edges
of
her
mouth
so
you
come
back
she
said
you
might
go
in
and
tell
me
how
he

how

in
jerrold
he
knocked
and
went
in
his
father
was
sitting
up
in
his
white
slender
bed
raised
on
arm
he
saw
his
face
strained
and
smoothed
with
exhaustion
sallow
white
against
the
pillows
the
the
sharp
peaked
nose
the
iron
grey
hair
pointed
with
sweat
sticking
to
the
forehead
a
face
of
piteous
tired
patience
waiting
he
saw
eliot
face
close
close
beside
it
by
the
edge
of
the
pillow
grave
and
sombre
and
intent
anne
was
crossing
the
room
from
the
bed
to
the
washstand
her
face
was
very
white
but
she
had
an
air
of
great
competence
and
composure
she
carried
a
white
basin
brimming
with
a
reddish
froth
he
saw
little
red
specks
splashed
on
the
sleeve
of
her
white
linen
gown
he
shuddered
eliot
made
a
sign
to
him
and
he
went
back
to
the
door
where
his
mother
waited
is
he
better
she
whispered
can
i
come
in
jerrold
shook
his
head
better
not
yet
you
send
for
me
if
if
yes
he
heard
her
trailing
away
along
the
gallery
he
went
into
the
room
he
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
stared
stared
at
his
father
lying
there
in
eliot
arms
he
would
have
liked
to
have
been
in
place
close
to
him
close
holding
him
as
it
was
he
could
do
nothing
but
stand
and
look
at
him
with
that
helpless
agonized
stare
he
to
look
at
him
to
look
and
look
punishing
himself
with
sight
for
not
having
seen
his
eyes
felt
hot
and
brittle
they
kept
on
filling
with
tears
burned
themselves
dry
and
filled
again
his
hand
clutched
the
edge
of
the
footrail
as
if
only
so
he
could
keep
his
stand
there
a
stream
of
warm
air
came
through
the
open
windows
everything
in
the
room
stood
still
in
it
unnaturally
still
waiting
he
was
aware
of
the
pattern
of
the
window
curtains
blue
parrots
perched
on
brown
branches
among
red
flowers
on
a
white
ground
it
all
hung
very
straight
and
still
waiting
anne
looked
at
him
and
spoke
she
was
standing
beside
the
bed
now
holding
the
clean
basin
and
a
towel
ready
jerrold
you
might
go
and
get
some
more
ice
it
in
the
bucket
in
the
break
it
up
into
little
pieces
like
that
you
split
it
with
a
needle
he
went
to
the
moving
like
a
sleepwalker
wrapped
in
his
horror
he
found
the
ice
he
broke
it
into
little
pieces
like
that
he
was
very
careful
and
conscientious
about
the
size
and
grateful
to
anne
for
giving
him
something
to
do
then
he
went
back
again
and
took
up
his
station
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
waited
his
father
still
lay
back
on
his
pillow
propped
by
eliot
arm
his
hands
were
folded
on
his
chest
above
the
bedclothes
anne
still
stood
by
the
bed
holding
her
basin
and
her
towel
ready
from
time
to
time
they
gave
him
little
pieces
of
ice
to
suck
once
he
opened
his
eyes
looked
round
the
room
and
spoke
is
your
mother
there
do
you
want
her
eliot
said
no
it
only
upset
her
do
let
her
come
in
he
closed
his
eyes
and
opened
them
again
is
that
anne
yes
who
did
you
think
it
was
i
do
know
i
sorry
anne
darling
the
word
broke
from
a
tender
inarticulate
sound
she
made
then
jerrold
he
said
jerrold
came
closer
his
father
right
arm
unfolded
itself
and
stretched
out
towards
him
along
the
bed
anne
whispered
take
his
hand
jerrold
took
it
he
could
feel
it
tremble
as
he
touched
it
it
all
right
jerry
he
said
it
all
right
he
gave
a
little
choking
cough
his
eyes
darkened
with
a
sudden
anxiety
a
fear
his
hand
slackened
his
head
sank
forward
anne
came
between
them
jerrold
felt
the
slight
thrust
of
her
body
pushing
him
aside
he
saw
her
arms
stretched
out
and
the
white
gleam
of
the
basin
then
the
haemorrhage
jet
after
jet
then
his
father
face
tilted
up
on
eliot
arm
very
white
and
anne
stooping
over
him
tenderly
and
her
hand
with
the
towel
wiping
the
red
foam
from
his
lips
then
eyes
glazed
between
lids
mouth
open
and
the
noise
of
death
eliot
arm
laid
down
its
burden
he
got
up
and
put
his
hand
on
jerrold
shoulder
and
led
him
out
of
the
room
go
out
into
the
air
he
said
i
tell
mother
jerrold
staggered
downstairs
and
through
the
hall
and
out
into
the
blinding
sunshine
far
down
the
avenue
he
could
hear
the
whirring
of
the
car
coming
back
from
cheltenham
the
lines
of
the
beech
trees
opened
to
let
it
through
he
saw
colin
sitting
up
beside
scarrott
above
his
head
a
lattice
ground
and
clattered
somebody
was
going
through
the
front
rooms
shutting
the
windows
and
pulling
down
the
blinds
jerrold
turned
back
into
the
house
to
meet
colin
there
upstairs
his
father
door
opened
and
shut
softly
and
anne
came
out
she
moved
along
the
gallery
to
her
room
between
the
dark
rails
he
could
see
her
white
skirt
and
her
arm
hanging
and
the
little
specks
of
red
splashed
on
the
white
sleeve
iii
jerrold
was
afraid
of
anne
and
he
saw
no
end
to
his
fear
he
had
been
dashed
against
the
suffering
he
was
trying
to
put
away
from
him
and
the
shock
of
it
had
killed
in
one
hour
his
young
adolescent
passion
she
would
be
for
ever
associated
with
that
suffering
he
would
never
see
anne
without
thinking
of
his
father
death
he
would
never
think
of
his
father
death
without
seeing
anne
he
would
see
her
for
ever
through
an
atmosphere
of
pain
and
horror
moving
as
she
had
moved
in
his
room
he
could
see
her
any
other
way
this
intolerable
memory
of
her
effaced
all
other
memories
memories
of
the
child
anne
with
the
rabbit
of
the
young
happy
anne
who
walked
and
rode
and
played
with
him
of
the
strange
mysterious
anne
he
had
found
yesterday
in
her
room
at
dawn
that
anne
belonged
to
a
time
he
had
done
with
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
but
the
anne
who
had
come
to
tell
him
his
father
was
dying
who
had
brought
him
to
his
father
who
had
bound
herself
up
inseparably
with
his
death
who
only
moved
from
the
scene
of
it
to
appear
dressed
in
black
and
carrying
the
flowers
for
his
funeral
she
was
wrapped
round
and
round
with
death
and
death
nothing
but
death
and
with
jerrold
suffering
when
he
saw
her
he
suffered
again
and
as
his
way
had
always
been
to
avoid
suffering
he
avoided
anne
his
eyes
turned
from
her
if
he
saw
her
coming
he
spoke
to
her
without
looking
at
her
he
tried
not
to
think
of
her
when
he
had
gone
he
would
try
not
to
remember
his
one
idea
was
to
go
to
get
away
from
the
place
his
father
had
died
in
and
from
the
people
who
had
seen
him
die
he
wanted
new
unknown
faces
new
unknown
voices
that
would
not
remind
him
ten
days
after
his
father
death
the
letter
came
from
john
severn
he
wrote
i
delighted
about
sir
charles
durham

a
lucky
devil

chap

fancy
to

if

anywhere
near
us
we
ought
to
give
her
the
jolliest
time
in
her
life
between

but
jerrold
said
adeline
when
she
had
read
this
letter

tell
him

home
sorry
mother
but
i
ca
stand
it
here
i
got
to
go
and
going
to
all
her
arguments
and
entreaties
he
had
one
answer
he
had
got
to
go
and
he
was
going
adeline
left
him
and
went
to
look
for
eliot
whom
she
found
in
his
room
packing
to
go
back
to
london
she
came
sobbing
to
eliot
it
too
dreadfully
hard
as
if
it
were
bad
enough
to
lose
my
darling
husband
i
must
lose
all
my
sons
not
one
of
you
will
stay
with
me
and
there
anne
going
off
with
jerrold
may
have
him
with
her
and
i
may
she
taken
everything
from
me
you
have
said
if
a
wife
place
was
anywhere
it
was
with
her
dying
husband
but
no
was
allowed
to
be
with
him
and
was
turned
out
of
his
room
my
dear
mother
you
know
you
were
i
you
turned
me
out
yourself
eliot
and
had
anne
in
only
because
you
could
stand
it
and
she
could
i
daresay
she
had
the
same
feelings
she
had
her
own
feelings
anyhow
only
she
controlled
them
she
stood
it
because
she
never
thought
of
her
feelings
she
only
thought
of
what
she
could
do
to
help
she
was
magnificent
of
course
you
think
so
because
you
in
love
with
her
she
must
take
you
too
as
if
jerrold
was
enough
she
has
taken
me
she
probably
wo
if
i
ask
her
you
should
say
those
things
mother
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
i
know
i
the
most
unhappy
woman
in
the
world
how
am
i
going
to
live
i
ca
stand
it
if
jerry
goes
he
got
to
go
mother
he
has
jerrold
place
is
here
he
got
a
duty
and
a
responsibility
your
dear
father
did
leave
him
the
estate
for
him
to
let
it
go
to
wrack
and
ruin
it
most
cruel
and
wrong
of
him
he
ca
do
anything
else
do
you
see
why
he
wants
to
go
he
stand
the
place
without
father
i
got
to
stand
it
so
he
may
well
he
wo
that
all
he
simply
funks
it
he
always
was
an
arrant
coward
where
trouble
was
concerned
he
think
of
other
people
and
how
bad
it
is
for
them
he
leaves
me
when
i
want
him
most
it
hard
on
you
mother
but
you
ca
stop
him
and
i
do
think
you
ought
to
try
oh
everybody
tells
me
what
ought
to
do
my
children
can
do
as
they
like
so
can
anne
she
and
jerrold
can
go
off
to
india
and
amuse
themselves
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
it
all
right
but
anne
did
go
off
to
india
when
she
spoke
to
jerrold
about
going
with
him
his
hard
unhappy
face
showed
her
that
he
did
want
her
you
rather
i
did
go
she
said
gently
it
is
that
anne
it
is
that
i
do
want
you
it
it
simply
that
i
want
to
get
away
from
here
to
get
away
from
everything
that
reminds
me
i
shall
go
off
my
head
if
i
got
to
remember
every
minute
every
time
i
see
somebody
who
i
want
to
make
a
clean
break
and
grow
a
new
memory
i
understand
you
need
tell
me
mother
does
i
wish
you
make
her
see
it
i
try
but
it
all
right
jerrold
i
wo
go
of
course
you
go
only
you
wo
think
me
a
brute
if
i
do
take
you
out
with
me
i
not
going
out
with
you
in
fact
i
do
think
i
going
at
all
i
only
wanted
to
because
of
going
out
together
and
because
of
the
chance
of
seeing
you
when
you
got
leave
i
only
thought
of
the
heavenly
times
we
might
have
had
do
do
anne
no
i
wo
after
all
i
should
care
a
rap
about
ambala
if
you
were
there
and
you
may
be
stationed
miles
away
i
rather
go
back
to
ilford
and
do
farming
ever
so
much
rather
india
would
really
have
wasted
a
lot
of
time
oh
anne
i
spoilt
all
your
pleasure
no
you
have
there
is
any
pleasure
to
spoil
now
what
a
brute
what
a
cad
you
must
think
me
i
do
jerry
it
not
your
fault
things
have
just
happened
and
you
see
i
understand
i
felt
the
same
about
auntie
adeline
after
mother
died
i
did
want
to
see
her
because
she
reminded
me
and
yet
really
i
loved
her
all
the
time
you
wo
go
back
on
me
for
it
i
would
go
back
on
you
whatever
you
did
and
you
must
keep
on
thinking
i
to
go
to
india
i
do
care
a
rap
about
india
itself
i
hate
and
i
simply
loathe
hot
places
and
daddy
want
me
out
there
really
i
shall
be
much
happier
on
my
farm
and
save
a
lot
of
expense
too
just
think
what
my
outfit
and
passage
would
have
cost
you
would
have
cared
what
it
cost
if
there
is
any
if
i
not
lying
really
not
lying
not
lying
she
would
have
given
up
more
than
india
to
save
jerrold
that
pang
of
memory
only
when
it
was
all
over
and
he
had
sailed
without
her
she
realized
in
one
wounding
flash
that
what
she
had
given
up
was
jerrold
himself
v
eliot
and
anne
i
anne
did
not
go
back
to
her
ilford
farm
at
once
adeline
had
made
that
impossible
at
the
prospect
of
anne
going
her
resentment
died
down
as
suddenly
as
it
had
risen
she
forgot
that
anne
had
taken
her
sons
affection
and
her
place
beside
her
husband
deathbed
and
though
she
could
help
feeling
rather
glad
that
jerrold
had
gone
to
india
without
anne
she
was
sorry
for
her
she
loved
her
and
she
meant
to
keep
her
she
said
she
simply
could
not
bear
it
if
anne
left
her
and
it
the
time
to
choose
when
she
wanted
her
as
she
had
never
wanted
her
before
she
had
nobody
to
turn
to
as
anne
knew
corbetts
and
hawtreys
and
markhams
and
people
were
all
very
well
but
they
were
outsiders
it
the
inside
people
that
i
want
now
anne
you
deep
inside
dear
yes
of
course
she
had
relations
but
relations
were
no
use
they
were
all
wrapped
up
in
their
own
tiresome
affairs
and
there
was
one
of
them
she
cared
for
as
she
cared
for
anne
i
could
care
more
if
you
were
my
own
daughter
darling
robert
felt
about
you
just
the
same
you
leave
me
and
anne
did
she
never
could
resist
unhappiness
she
thought
i
was
glad
enough
to
stop
with
her
through
all
the
happy
times
i
be
a
perfect
beast
to
go
and
leave
her
now
when
she
miserable
and
got
anybody
it
would
have
been
better
for
anne
if
she
could
have
gone
robert
fielding
death
and
jerrold
absence
were
two
griefs
that
inflamed
each
other
they
came
together
to
make
one
immense
intolerable
wound
and
here
at
wyck
she
could
move
without
coming
upon
something
that
touched
it
and
stung
it
to
fresh
pain
but
anne
was
not
like
jerrold
to
turn
from
what
she
loved
because
it
hurt
her
for
as
long
as
she
could
remember
all
her
happiness
had
come
to
her
at
wyck
if
unhappiness
came
now
she
had
got
as
eliot
said
to
take
it
and
so
she
stayed
on
through
the
autumn
then
over
christmas
to
the
new
year
this
time
because
of
colin
who
was
suffering
from
depression
colin
had
never
got
over
his
father
death
and
jerrold
going
and
the
last
thing
jerrold
had
said
to
her
before
he
went
was
you
look
after
wo
you
do
let
him
go
grousing
about
by
himself
jerrold
had
always
expected
her
to
look
after
colin
at
seventeen
there
was
still
something
piteous
and
breakable
about
him
something
that
clung
to
you
for
help
eliot
said
that
if
colin
did
look
out
he
be
a
regular
neurotic
but
he
owned
that
anne
was
good
for
him
i
do
know
what
you
do
to
him
but
he
better
when
you
there
eliot
was
the
one
who
appeared
to
have
recovered
first
he
met
the
shock
of
his
father
death
with
a
defiant
energy
and
will
he
was
working
now
at
bacteriology
under
sir
martin
crozier
covered
with
a
white
linen
coat
in
a
room
of
inconceivable
cleanness
surrounded
by
and
mixing
jars
eliot
spent
the
best
part
of
the
day
handling
the
germs
of
the
deadliest
diseases
making
cultures
examining
them
under
the
microscope
preparing
vaccines
he
went
home
to
the
brown
velvety
leathery
study
in
his
welbeck
street
flat
to
write
out
his
notes
or
read
some
monograph
on
inoculation
or
he
dined
with
a
colleague
and
talked
to
him
about
bacteria
at
this
period
of
his
youth
eliot
had
more
than
ever
the
appearance
of
inhuman
preoccupation
his
dark
serious
face
detached
itself
with
a
sort
of
sullen
apathy
from
the
social
scene
he
seemed
to
have
no
keen
interests
beyond
his
slides
and
mixing
jars
and
women
for
whom
his
indifference
had
a
perverse
fascination
said
of
him
dr
fielding
is
interested
in
people
only
in
their
diseases
and
not
really
in
diseases
only
in
their
germs
they
never
suspected
that
eliot
was
passionate
and
that
a
fierce
pity
had
driven
him
into
his
profession
the
thought
of
preventable
disease
filled
him
with
fury
he
had
no
tolerance
for
the
society
that
tolerated
it
he
suffered
because
he
had
a
clearer
vision
and
a
profounder
sense
of
suffering
than
most
persons
up
to
the
time
of
his
father
death
all
eliot
suffering
had
been
other
people
he
could
rest
till
he
had
done
something
to
remove
the
cause
of
it
add
to
this
an
insatiable
curiosity
as
to
causes
and
you
have
the
main
bent
of
eliot
mind
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
nobody
but
anne
who
saw
that
hidden
side
of
him
knew
that
he
was
sorry
for
people
and
that
being
sorry
for
them
had
made
him
what
he
was
like
jerrold
and
yet
unlike
him
eliot
was
attracted
to
suffering
by
the
same
sensitiveness
that
made
jerrold
avoid
everything
once
associated
with
it
and
so
the
very
thing
that
jerrold
could
bear
to
remember
was
what
drew
eliot
closer
to
anne
he
saw
her
as
jerrold
had
seen
her
moving
composed
and
competent
in
his
father
room
he
saw
her
stooping
over
him
to
help
him
he
saw
the
specks
of
blood
on
her
white
sleeve
and
he
thought
of
her
with
the
more
tenderness
from
that
instant
he
really
loved
her
he
wanted
anne
as
he
had
never
conceived
himself
wanting
any
woman
he
could
hardly
remember
his
first
adolescent
feeling
for
her
that
confused
mixture
of
ignorant
desire
and
fear
so
different
was
it
from
the
intense
clear
passion
that
possessed
him
now
at
night
when
his
work
was
done
he
lay
in
bed
not
sleeping
thinking
of
anne
with
desire
that
knew
itself
too
well
to
be
afraid
anne
was
the
one
thing
necessary
to
him
beside
his
work
necessary
as
a
living
part
of
himself
she
could
only
not
come
before
his
work
because
eliot
work
came
before
himself
and
his
own
happiness
when
he
went
down
every
other
to
he
knew
that
it
was
to
see
anne
his
mother
knew
it
too
i
wish
eliot
would
marry
she
said
why
said
anne
because
then
he
would
be
so
keen
on
going
off
to
look
for
germs
in
disgusting
climates
anne
wondered
whether
adeline
knew
eliot
for
eliot
talked
to
her
about
his
work
as
he
walked
with
her
at
a
fine
swinging
pace
over
the
open
country
taking
all
his
exercise
now
while
he
could
get
it
that
was
another
thing
he
liked
about
anne
severn
her
splendid
physical
fitness
she
could
go
stride
for
stride
with
him
and
mile
for
mile
and
never
tire
her
mind
too
was
robust
and
active
and
full
of
curiosity
it
listened
by
the
hour
and
never
tired
it
could
move
undismayed
among
horrors
she
could
see
as
he
saw
the
beauty
of
the
long
trains
of
research
by
which
sir
martin
crozier
had
tracked
down
the
bacillus
of
amoebic
dysentery
and
established
the
difference
between
typhoid
and
malta
fever
once
started
on
his
subject
the
grave
sullen
eliot
talked
excitedly
you
do
see
anne
how
thrilling
it
is
do
you
for
me
nothing
but
bacteriology
i
always
meant
to
go
in
for
it
and
sir
martin
magnificent
absolutely
you
see
all
these
disgusting
diseases
can
be
prevented
it
inconceivable
that
they
should
be
tolerated
in
a
civilized
country
people
ca
care
a
rap
or
they
could
sleep
in
their
beds
they
ought
to
get
up
and
make
a
public
row
about
it
to
insist
on
compulsory
inoculation
for
everybody
whether
they
like
it
or
not
it
really
is
enough
to
cure
people
of
diseases
when
they
got
them
we
ought
to
see
that
they
never
get
them
that
there
are
any
to
get
what
we
do
know
yet
is
the
complete
behaviour
of
all
these
bacteria
among
themselves
a
bad
bacillus
may
be
doing
good
work
by
holding
down
a
worse
one
it
conceivable
that
if
we
succeeded
in
exterminating
all
known
diseases
we
might
release
an
unknown
one
supremely
horrible
that
would
exterminate
the
race
oh
eliot
how
awful
how
can
sleep
in
your
bed
you
need
worry
it
only
a
nightmare
idea
of
mine
and
so
on
and
so
on
for
he
was
still
so
young
that
he
wanted
anne
to
be
excited
by
the
things
that
excited
him
and
anne
told
him
all
about
her
ilford
farm
and
what
she
meant
to
do
on
it
eliot
did
behave
like
aunt
adeline
he
listened
beautifully
like
uncle
robert
and
jerrold
as
if
it
was
really
most
important
that
you
should
have
a
farm
and
work
on
it
what
i
want
is
to
sell
it
and
get
one
here
i
do
want
to
be
anywhere
else
i
ca
tell
you
how
frightfully
i
am
when
i
away
i
keep
on
seeing
those
gables
with
the
little
stone
balls
and
the
peacocks
and
the
fields
down
to
the
manor
farm
and
the
hills
eliot
when
i
away
i
always
dreaming
that
i
trying
to
get
back
to
them
and
something
stops
me
or
i
see
them
and
they
turn
into
something
else
i
sha
be
happy
till
i
can
come
back
for
good
you
do
want
to
go
to
india
eliot
heart
began
to
beat
as
he
asked
his
question
i
want
to
work
to
work
hard
to
work
till
i
so
dead
tired
that
i
roll
off
to
sleep
the
minute
i
get
into
bed
so
tired
that
i
dream
that
is
right
you
too
young
to
feel
like
that
anne
i
do
feel
like
it
you
feel
like
it
yourself
my
farm
is
to
me
what
your
old
bacteria
are
to
you
oh
if
i
thought
it
was
the
farm
why
what
else
did
you
think
it
was
eliot
could
bring
himself
to
tell
her
he
took
refuge
in
apparent
irrelevance
you
know
father
left
me
the
manor
farm
house
do
you
no
i
did
i
suppose
he
thought
you
want
to
come
back
like
me
well
i
glad
i
got
it
mother
got
the
dower
house
in
wyck
but
she
stay
on
here
till
till
jerrold
comes
back
said
anne
bravely
i
do
suppose
jerry
turn
her
out
even
then
unless
but
neither
he
nor
anne
had
the
courage
to
say
unless
he
marries
not
anne
because
she
could
trust
herself
with
the
theme
of
marrying
not
eliot
because
he
had
jerrold
word
for
it
that
if
he
married
anybody
ever
it
would
not
be
anne
it
was
this
assurance
that
made
it
possible
for
him
to
say
what
he
had
been
thinking
of
saying
all
the
time
that
he
talked
to
anne
about
his
bacteriology
bacteriology
was
a
screen
behind
which
eliot
uncertain
of
anne
feelings
sheltered
himself
against
irrevocable
disaster
he
meant
to
ask
anne
to
marry
him
but
he
kept
putting
it
off
because
so
long
as
he
did
know
for
certain
that
she
would
have
him
he
was
at
liberty
to
think
she
would
he
would
not
be
taking
her
from
jerrold
jerrold
inconceivable
ass
did
want
her
eliot
had
made
sure
of
that
months
ago
the
night
before
jerrold
sailed
he
had
simply
put
it
to
him
what
did
he
mean
to
do
about
anne
severn
and
jerrold
had
made
it
very
plain
that
his
chief
object
in
going
to
india
was
to
get
away
from
anne
severn
and
everything
eliot
knew
jerrold
too
well
to
suspect
his
sincerity
so
he
considered
that
the
way
was
now
honorably
open
to
him
his
only
uncertainty
was
anne
herself
he
had
meant
to
give
her
a
year
to
forget
jerrold
in
if
she
was
ever
going
to
forget
him
though
in
moments
of
deeper
insight
he
realized
that
anne
was
not
likely
to
forget
nor
to
marry
anybody
else
as
long
as
she
remembered
yet
eliot
reasoned
women
did
marry
even
remembering
they
married
and
were
happy
you
saw
it
every
day
he
was
content
to
take
anne
on
her
own
terms
at
any
cost
at
any
risk
he
had
never
been
afraid
of
risks
and
once
he
had
faced
the
chance
of
her
refusal
all
other
dangers
were
insignificant
a
year
was
a
long
time
and
eliot
had
to
consider
the
probability
of
his
going
out
to
central
africa
with
sir
martin
crozier
to
investigate
sleeping
sickness
he
wanted
the
thing
settled
one
way
or
another
before
he
went
he
put
it
off
again
till
the
next
and
in
the
meanwhile
sir
martin
crozier
had
seen
him
he
was
starting
in
the
spring
and
eliot
was
to
go
with
him
it
was
on
sunday
evening
that
he
spoke
to
anne
sitting
with
her
under
the
beeches
at
the
top
of
the
field
where
she
and
jerrold
had
sat
together
eliot
had
chosen
his
place
badly
i
would
bother
you
so
soon
if
i
was
going
away
but
i
simply
must
must
know
must
know
what
whether
you
care
for
me
at
all
not
much
of
course
but
just
enough
not
to
hate
marrying
me
anne
turned
her
face
full
on
him
and
looked
at
him
with
her
innocent
candid
eyes
and
all
she
said
was
you
know
about
jerrold
you
oh
god
yes
i
know
all
about
him
he
why
i
ca
i
tell
you
i
know
all
about
jerrold
he
is
a
good
enough
reason
good
enough
for
me
not
unless
but
he
could
say
it
not
unless
he
cares
for
me
that
why
you
asking
me
then
because
you
know
he
does
well
it
would
be
much
good
if
i
knew
he
did
eliot
it
awful
of
me
to
talk
about
it
as
if
he
said
he
did
he
never
said
a
word
he
never
will
i
afraid
he
wo
anne
do
imagine
i
ever
thought
he
would
he
never
did
anything
to
make
me
think
it
for
a
minute
really
are
you
quite
sure
he
did
quite
sure
i
made
it
all
up
out
of
my
head
my
silly
head
i
care
what
you
think
of
me
so
long
as
you
do
think
it
was
fault
i
should
go
on
caring
for
him
whatever
he
did
or
did
do
i
know
you
would
but
it
possible
to
care
for
two
people
and
marry
one
of
them
no
matter
which
it
possible
for
me
if
i
ca
have
the
person
i
want
i
wo
have
anybody
it
is
wise
anne
i
tell
you
i
could
make
you
care
for
me
i
know
all
about
you
i
know
how
you
think
and
how
you
feel
i
understand
you
better
than
jerrold
does
you
be
happy
with
me
and
you
be
safe
it
no
use
i
rather
be
unhappy
and
in
danger
if
it
was
with
jerrold
you
be
unhappy
and
in
danger
without
him
i
do
care
besides
i
sha
be
i
shall
work
you
work
too
it
be
so
exciting
that
you
soon
forget
all
about
me
you
know
i
sha
and
i
never
give
you
up
unless
jerrold
gets
you
eliot
i
only
told
you
about
jerrold
because
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
so
that
you
might
think
it
was
anything
in
you
it
is
something
in
me
then
tell
me
if
it
had
been
for
jerry
do
you
think
you
might
have
cared
for
me
yes
i
do
i
quite
easily
might
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
jolly
good
thing
if
i
could
now
only
i
ca
i
ca
poor
little
anne
does
it
comfort
you
to
think
i
have
cared
if
it
had
been
for
jerry
it
does
very
much
eliot
you
the
only
person
i
can
talk
to
about
him
do
you
mind
telling
me
whether
he
said
that
to
you
or
whether
you
just
guessed
it
what
why
that
he
would
ever
i
asked
him
anne
because
i
had
to
know
and
he
told
me
i
thought
he
told
you
yes
he
told
me
but
i
a
cad
for
letting
you
think
he
did
care
for
you
i
believe
he
did
or
that
he
would
have
cared
awfully
if
my
father
had
died
just
then
your
being
in
the
room
that
day
upset
him
if
it
had
been
for
that
yes
but
there
that
it
was
like
he
was
when
binky
died
and
he
could
stand
yearp
do
you
remember
how
he
would
let
me
go
with
him
to
see
yearp
because
he
said
he
did
want
me
mixed
up
with
it
well
i
been
mixed
up
that
all
still
anne
i
certain
he
have
cared
if
that
any
comfort
to
you
you
did
make
it
up
out
of
your
dear
little
head
we
all
thought
it
father
thought
it
i
believe
he
wanted
it
if
he
only
known
she
thought
if
he
only
known
how
he
had
hurt
her
he
who
had
never
hurt
anybody
in
all
his
beautiful
life
dear
uncle
robert
there
no
good
talking
about
it
i
knew
the
minute
jerry
said
he
did
want
me
to
go
to
india
with
him
is
that
why
you
did
go
yes
that
was
a
mistake
anne
you
should
have
gone
how
could
i
after
that
and
if
i
had
he
only
have
kept
away
you
should
have
let
him
go
first
and
then
gone
after
him
you
should
have
turned
up
suddenly
in
wonderful
clothes
looking
cheerful
and
beautiful
so
that
you
wiped
out
the
memory
he
funked
as
it
is
left
him
nothing
else
to
think
of
i
daresay
that
what
i
should
have
done
but
it
too
late
i
ca
do
it
now
i
not
so
sure
what
go
jerrold
hunt
him
down
dress
up
and
scheme
to
make
him
marry
me
yes
yes
yes
eliot
you
know
i
could
you
said
once
you
commit
a
crime
for
anybody
you
cared
about
a
crime
yes
but
not
that
i
rather
die
you
too
fastidious
it
only
the
unscrupulous
people
who
get
what
they
want
in
this
world
they
know
what
they
want
and
go
for
it
they
stamp
on
everything
and
everybody
that
gets
in
their
way
oh
eliot
dear
i
know
what
i
want
and
i
go
for
it
if
only
jerrold
knew
too
he
would
know
if
you
showed
him
and
that
just
what
i
ca
do
well
do
say
i
did
give
you
the
best
possible
advice
against
my
own
interests
too
it
was
sweet
of
you
but
you
see
how
impossible
it
is
i
see
how
adorable
you
are
you
always
were
iv
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
adeline
was
furious
she
had
asked
eliot
whether
he
was
or
was
not
going
to
marry
anne
severn
and
was
told
that
he
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
that
afternoon
and
that
she
would
have
him
would
have
you
what
she
thinking
of
you
better
ask
her
said
eliot
never
dreaming
that
she
would
but
that
was
what
adeline
did
she
came
that
night
to
anne
room
just
as
anne
was
getting
into
bed
unappeased
by
her
defenseless
attitude
she
attacked
with
violence
what
all
this
about
eliot
asking
you
to
marry
him
anne
uncurled
herself
and
sat
up
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
did
he
tell
you
yes
of
course
he
told
me
he
says
you
refused
him
did
you
i
afraid
i
did
then
anne
you
a
perfect
little
fool
but
auntie
i
do
love
him
nonsense
you
love
him
as
much
as
most
people
love
the
men
they
marry
he
quite
sensible
he
does
want
you
to
go
mad
about
him
he
wants
more
than
i
can
give
him
well
all
i
can
say
is
if
you
ca
give
him
what
he
wants
you
no
business
to
go
about
with
him
as
you
been
doing
i
been
going
about
with
him
all
my
life
and
i
never
dreamed
want
to
marry
me
what
did
you
suppose
he
want
why
nothing
but
just
to
go
about
as
we
always
did
you
idiot
i
do
see
why
you
should
be
so
cross
about
it
adeline
sat
down
in
the
armchair
at
the
head
of
the
bed
prepared
to
have
it
out
with
anne
i
suppose
you
think
my
son
happiness
is
nothing
to
me
did
it
occur
to
you
that
if
you
refuse
him
he
stick
for
years
in
that
awful
place
he
going
to
whereas
if
he
had
a
wife
in
england
there
be
a
chance
of
his
coming
home
now
and
then
perhaps
he
never
go
out
again
i
sorry
auntie
i
ca
marry
eliot
even
to
keep
him
in
england
even
to
please
you
even
to
save
his
life
you
mean
you
do
care
if
he
dies
of
some
hideous
tropical
disease
i
care
awfully
but
i
ca
marry
him
he
knows
why
it
more
than
i
do
if
you
thinking
of
jerrold
you
need
i
thought
you
done
with
that
schoolgirlish
nonsense
i
not
of
him
i
not
of
anybody
and
i
wish
you
leave
me
alone
my
dear
child
how
can
i
leave
you
alone
when
i
see
you
making
the
mistake
of
your
life
eliot
is
absolutely
the
right
person
for
you
if
you
only
the
sense
to
see
it
he
got
more
character
than
anybody
i
know
much
more
than
dear
jerry
he
be
ten
times
more
interesting
to
live
with
i
thought
jerrold
was
your
favourite
no
eliot
my
dear
always
eliot
he
was
my
first
baby
well
i
awfully
sorry
you
mind
so
much
and
i
marry
eliot
if
i
could
i
simply
hate
him
to
be
unhappy
but
he
wo
be
he
live
to
be
frightfully
glad
i
did
what
are
you
going
to
kiss
me
adeline
had
risen
and
turned
away
with
the
great
dignity
of
her
righteous
anger
i
do
feel
like
it
she
said
i
think
you
been
thoroughly
selfish
and
unkind
i
hate
girls
who
go
on
like
that
making
a
man
mad
about
you
by
pretending
to
be
his
comrade
and
then
throwing
him
over
i
had
more
men
in
love
with
me
anne
than
you
seen
in
your
life
but
i
never
did
oh
auntie
what
about
father
and
you
were
engaged
to
him
well
anyhow
said
adeline
softened
by
the
recollection
i
engaged
she
smiled
her
enchanting
smile
and
anne
observing
the
breakdown
of
dignity
got
up
off
the
bed
and
kissed
her
i
do
suppose
she
said
that
father
was
the
only
one
he
was
but
then
with
my
dear
it
was
their
own
risk
they
knew
where
they
were
v
in
march
nineteen
eleven
eliot
went
out
to
central
africa
he
stayed
there
two
years
investigating
malaria
and
sleeping
sickness
then
he
went
on
to
the
straits
settlements
and
finally
took
a
partnership
in
a
practice
at
penang
anne
left
wyck
at
easter
and
returned
in
august
because
of
colin
then
she
went
back
to
her
ilford
farm
the
two
years
passed
and
in
the
spring
of
the
third
year
nineteen
fourteen
she
came
again
vi
queenie
i
something
awful
had
happened
adeline
had
told
anne
about
it
it
seemed
that
colin
in
his
second
year
at
cambridge
when
he
should
have
given
his
whole
mind
to
reading
for
the
diplomatic
service
had
had
the
imprudence
to
get
engaged
and
to
a
girl
that
adeline
had
never
heard
of
about
whom
nothing
was
known
but
that
she
was
remarkably
handsome
and
that
her
family
courthopes
of
leicestershire
were
in
adeline
brief
phrase
all
right
from
the
terrace
they
could
see
coming
up
the
lawn
from
the
goldfish
pond
colin
and
his
girl
queenie
courthope
she
came
slowly
her
short
russian
skirt
swinging
out
from
her
ankles
the
brilliance
of
her
face
showed
clear
at
a
distance
vermilion
on
white
flaming
hard
crystal
eyes
sweeping
and
flashing
bobbed
hair
shining
in
the
sun
then
a
dominant
squarish
jaw
and
a
mouth
exquisitely
formed
but
thin
a
vermilion
thread
drawn
between
her
staring
insolent
nostrils
and
the
rise
of
her
round
chin
this
face
in
its
approach
expressed
a
profound
arrogant
indifference
to
adeline
and
anne
only
as
it
turned
towards
colin
its
eyes
lowered
and
were
soft
dark
under
the
black
feathers
of
their
brows
colin
looked
back
at
it
with
a
shy
adoring
tenderness
queenie
could
be
even
more
superbly
uninterested
than
adeline
in
adeline
there
was
a
passive
innocence
a
candor
that
disarmed
you
but
queenie
was
insolent
and
hostile
it
took
possession
of
the
scene
and
challenged
every
comer
hallo
anne
colin
shouted
how
did
you
get
here
motored
down
i
say
have
you
got
a
car
only
just
drove
yourself
rather
queenie
scowled
as
if
there
were
something
disagreeable
to
her
in
the
idea
that
anne
should
have
a
car
of
her
own
and
drive
it
she
endured
the
introduction
in
silence
and
addressed
herself
with
an
air
of
exclusiveness
to
colin
what
are
we
going
to
do
anything
you
like
he
said
i
play
you
singles
then
anne
might
like
to
play
said
colin
but
he
still
looked
at
queenie
as
she
flamed
in
her
beauty
oh
three
a
rotten
game
you
ca
play
the
two
of
us
unless
miss
severn
handicaps
me
she
wo
do
that
anne
could
take
us
both
on
and
play
a
decent
game
queenie
picked
up
her
racquet
and
stood
between
them
beating
her
skirts
with
little
strokes
of
irritated
impatience
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
colin
trying
you
could
see
to
dominate
him
we
better
take
it
in
turns
he
said
thanks
i
rather
not
play
i
driven
miles
really
rather
queenie
backed
towards
the
court
oh
come
on
colin
if
you
coming
he
went
what
do
you
think
of
queenie
adeline
said
she
very
handsome
yes
anne
but
it
is
a
nice
face
now
is
it
anne
could
say
it
was
a
nice
face
it
awful
to
think
of
colin
being
married
to
it
he
only
now
and
she
seven
years
older
if
it
had
been
anybody
but
colin
if
it
had
been
eliot
or
jerrold
i
should
have
minded
so
much
they
can
look
after
themselves
he
never
stand
up
against
that
horrible
girl
she
does
look
terribly
strong
and
cruel
anne
as
if
she
might
hurt
him
i
do
want
him
to
be
hurt
i
ca
bear
her
taking
him
away
from
me
my
little
did
hope
anne
that
if
you
would
have
eliot
i
have
colin
but
auntie
i
years
older
than
he
is
he
a
baby
if
he
a
baby
he
want
somebody
older
to
look
after
him
queenie
even
better
fitted
than
i
am
then
do
you
think
anne
she
proposed
to
colin
no
i
should
think
it
was
necessary
i
should
say
she
was
capable
of
anything
my
only
hope
is
they
tire
each
other
out
before
they
married
and
break
it
off
all
afternoon
on
the
tennis
court
below
queenie
played
against
colin
she
played
vigorously
excitedly
savagely
to
win
she
could
hide
her
annoyance
when
he
beat
her
what
was
i
to
do
he
said
you
do
like
it
when
i
beat
you
but
if
i
was
beaten
you
would
like
ii
adeline
only
hope
was
not
realized
they
had
had
time
to
tire
of
each
other
before
the
war
broke
out
and
colin
insisted
on
marrying
before
he
joined
up
their
engagement
had
left
him
nervous
and
unfit
and
his
idea
was
that
once
married
he
would
present
a
better
appearance
before
the
medical
examiners
but
after
a
month
of
queenie
colin
was
more
nervous
and
unfit
than
ever
i
ca
think
said
adeline
what
that
woman
does
to
him
she
wear
him
out
so
colin
waited
trying
to
get
fitter
and
afraid
to
volunteer
lest
he
should
be
rejected
everybody
around
him
was
moving
rapidly
queenie
had
taken
up
motoring
so
that
she
could
drive
an
ambulance
car
at
the
front
anne
had
gone
up
to
london
for
her
red
cross
training
eliot
had
left
his
practice
to
his
partner
at
penang
and
had
come
home
and
joined
the
army
medical
corps
eliot
home
on
leave
for
three
days
before
he
went
out
tried
hard
to
keep
colin
back
from
the
war
in
eliot
opinion
colin
was
not
fit
and
never
would
be
fit
to
fight
he
was
just
behaving
as
he
always
had
behaved
rushing
forward
trying
insanely
to
do
the
thing
he
never
could
do
do
you
mean
to
say
they
wo
pass
me
he
asked
oh
they
pass
you
all
right
eliot
said
they
give
you
an
expensive
training
and
send
you
into
the
trenches
and
in
any
time
from
a
day
to
a
month
you
be
in
hospital
with
then
you
be
discharged
as
unfit
having
wasted
everybody
time
and
made
a
damned
nuisance
of
yourself
suppose
i
ought
to
say
it
splendid
of
you
to
want
to
go
out
but
it
is
splendid
it
idiotic
you
be
simply
butting
in
where
you
not
wanted
taking
a
better
man
place
taking
a
better
man
commission
taking
a
better
man
bed
in
a
hospital
i
tell
you
we
do
want
men
who
are
going
to
crumple
up
in
their
first
action
do
you
think
i
going
to
funk
then
said
poor
colin
funk
oh
lord
no
you
stick
it
till
you
drop
till
paralyzed
till
you
lost
your
voice
and
memory
till
you
an
utter
wreck
there
be
enough
of
poor
devils
without
you
but
why
should
i
go
like
that
more
than
anybody
else
because
you
made
that
way
because
you
have
got
a
nervous
system
that
can
stand
the
racket
the
noises
alone
will
do
for
you
you
be
as
right
as
rain
if
you
keep
out
of
it
but
jerrold
coming
back
go
out
at
once
how
can
i
stick
at
home
when
he
gone
heaps
of
good
work
to
be
done
at
home
not
by
men
of
my
age
by
men
of
your
nervous
organization
your
going
out
would
be
sheer
waste
why
not
does
it
matter
what
becomes
of
me
no
it
does
it
matters
though
that
you
be
taking
a
better
man
place
now
colin
really
did
want
to
go
out
and
fight
as
he
had
always
wanted
to
follow
jerrold
lead
he
wanted
it
so
badly
that
it
seemed
to
him
a
form
of
and
this
idea
of
taking
a
better
man
place
so
worked
on
him
that
he
had
almost
decided
to
give
it
up
since
that
was
the
sacrifice
required
of
him
when
he
told
queenie
what
eliot
had
said
all
i
can
say
is
said
queenie
that
if
you
do
go
out
i
shall
give
up
i
no
use
for
men
with
cold
feet
ca
you
see
said
colin
he
almost
hated
queenie
in
that
moment
what
i
afraid
of
being
a
damned
nuisance
that
what
eliot
says
i
be
i
do
know
how
he
knows
he
does
know
everything
if
brother
tried
to
stop
my
going
to
the
front
i
jolly
soon
tell
him
to
go
to
hell
i
swear
colin
if
you
back
out
of
it
i
wo
speak
to
you
again
i
not
asking
you
to
do
anything
i
funk
myself
oh
shut
up
i
going
all
right
not
because
you
asked
me
but
because
i
want
to
if
you
did
i
should
think
you
feel
pretty
rotten
when
i
out
with
my
field
ambulance
said
queenie
damn
your
field
ambulance
no
i
did
mean
that
old
thing
splendid
of
you
to
go
but
you
no
business
to
suppose
i
funked
i
funk
nobody
knows
till
they
tried
but
i
was
going
all
right
till
eliot
put
me
off
oh
if
you
put
off
as
easily
as
all
that
she
was
intolerable
she
seemed
to
think
he
was
only
going
because
shamed
him
into
it
that
evening
he
sang
are
you
doing
all
the
day
rendal
my
son
what
are
you
doing
all
the
day
my
pretty
one
he
understood
that
song
now
will
you
leave
to
your
lover
rendal
my
son
what
will
you
leave
to
your
lover
my
pretty
one
a
rope
to
hang
her
mother
a
rope
to
hang
her
mother
go
it
out
on
the
terrace
queenie
laughed
her
harsh
cruel
laugh
i
sick
to
my
heart
and
i
fain
would
lie
down
sick
to
my
heart
and
i
fain
would
lie
down
queenie
echoed
with
clipped
words
mocking
him
he
hated
queenie
and
he
loved
her
at
night
at
night
she
would
unbend
she
would
be
tender
and
passionate
she
would
touch
him
with
quick
hurrying
caresses
she
would
put
her
arms
round
him
and
draw
him
to
her
kissing
and
kissing
and
with
her
young
beautiful
body
pressed
tight
to
him
with
her
mouth
on
his
and
her
eyes
shining
close
and
big
in
the
darkness
colin
would
forget
iii
cutler
field
ambulance
british
hospital
antwerp
dearest
auntie
adeline
i
have
been
able
to
write
before
there
been
a
lot
of
fighting
all
round
here
and
frightfully
busy
getting
in
wounded
and
when
you
done
too
tired
to
sit
up
and
write
letters
you
simply
roll
into
bed
and
drop
off
to
sleep
sometimes
we
out
with
the
ambulances
half
the
night
you
need
worry
about
me
i
keeping
awfully
fit
i
glad
now
i
always
lived
in
the
open
air
and
played
games
and
ploughed
my
own
land
my
muscles
are
as
hard
as
any
tommie
so
are
queenie
you
see
we
have
to
act
as
stretcher
bearers
as
well
as
chauffeurs
you
not
much
good
if
you
ca
carry
your
own
wounded
queenie
is
simply
splendid
she
really
know
what
fear
is
and
she
at
her
very
best
under
fire
it
sort
of
excites
her
and
bucks
her
up
i
ca
help
seeing
how
fine
she
is
though
she
was
so
beastly
to
poor
old
before
he
joined
up
but
talk
of
the
war
bringing
out
the
best
in
people
you
should
simply
see
her
out
here
with
the
wounded
cutler
the
commandant
thinks
no
end
of
her
she
drives
for
him
and
i
drive
for
a
little
doctor
man
called
dicky
cartwright
awfully
good
at
his
job
and
decent
queenie
does
like
him
i
ca
think
why
darling
take
care
of
yourself
your
loving
anne
antwerp
you
ask
me
what
i
really
think
of
queenie
at
close
quarters
well
the
quarters
are
very
close
and
i
know
she
simply
hates
me
she
was
fearfully
sick
when
she
found
we
were
both
in
the
same
corps
she
always
trying
to
get
up
a
row
about
something
she
like
to
have
me
fired
out
of
belgium
if
she
could
but
i
mean
to
stay
as
long
as
i
can
so
i
wo
quarrel
with
her
she
ca
do
it
all
by
herself
and
when
i
feel
like
going
back
on
her
i
tell
myself
how
magnificent
she
is
so
plucky
and
so
clever
at
her
job
i
do
wonder
that
half
the
men
in
our
corps
are
gone
on
her
and
there
a
belgian
colonel
the
one
cutler
gets
his
orders
from
who
make
a
frantic
fool
of
himself
if
she
let
him
but
good
old
queenie
sticks
to
her
job
and
behaves
as
if
they
were
there
that
makes
them
madder
have
thought
they
never
have
had
the
time
to
be
such
asses
in
but
it
wonderful
what
a
state
you
can
get
into
in
your
few
odd
moments
dicky
says
it
the
war
whips
you
up
and
makes
it
all
the
easier
i
do
know
furnes
that
where
we
are
now
i
simply
ca
describe
the
retreat
it
was
too
awful
and
i
do
want
to
think
about
it
settled
down
in
a
house
we
commandeered
and
i
suppose
we
shall
stick
here
till
we
shelled
out
of
it
talking
of
shelling
queenie
is
funny
she
quite
annoyed
if
anybody
besides
herself
gets
anywhere
near
a
shell
we
picked
up
two
more
in
ostend
and
a
queer
little
lady
out
for
a
job
at
the
front
cutler
took
her
on
as
a
sort
of
secretary
at
first
queenie
was
so
frantic
that
she
would
speak
to
her
and
swore
she
make
the
corps
too
hot
to
hold
her
but
when
she
found
that
the
little
lady
was
for
the
danger
zone
and
only
proposed
to
cook
and
keep
our
accounts
for
us
she
calmed
down
and
was
quite
decent
then
the
other
day
miss
mullins
came
and
told
us
that
a
bit
of
shell
had
chipped
off
the
corner
of
her
kitchen
the
poor
old
thing
was
ever
so
proud
and
pleased
about
it
and
queenie
snubbed
her
frightfully
and
said
she
was
in
any
danger
at
all
and
asked
her
how
she
enjoy
it
if
she
was
out
all
day
under
fire
like
us
and
she
was
furious
with
me
because
i
had
the
luck
to
get
into
the
bombardment
at
dixmude
and
she
had
she
talked
as
if
done
her
out
of
her
shelling
on
purpose
whereas
it
only
meant
that
i
happened
to
be
on
the
spot
when
the
ambulances
were
sent
out
and
she
was
away
somewhere
with
her
own
car
she
really
is
rather
vulgar
about
shells
dicky
says
it
a
form
of
war
snobbishness
he
has
got
a
scrap
of
it
but
i
think
it
really
is
because
all
the
time
she
afraid
of
one
of
us
being
killed
it
must
be
that
even
dicky
owns
that
she
splendid
though
he
does
like
her
iv
five
months
later
the
manor
gloucestershire
my
darling
anne
queenie
will
have
told
you
about
colin
he
was
through
all
that
frightful
shelling
at
ypres
in
april
he
been
three
weeks
in
the
hospital
at
boulogne
with
had
it
twice
and
now
he
back
and
in
that
officers
hospital
in
kensington
not
a
bit
better
i
really
think
queenie
ought
to
get
leave
and
come
over
and
see
him
eliot
was
perfectly
right
he
ought
never
to
have
gone
out
of
course
he
was
as
plucky
as
they
make
them
went
back
into
the
trenches
after
his
first
but
his
nerves
stand
it
whether
they
treating
him
right
or
not
they
seem
to
be
able
to
do
anything
for
him
i
writing
to
queenie
but
tell
her
she
must
come
and
see
him
your
loving
adeline
fielding
three
months
later

would
make
your
heart
bleed
to
see
him
he
ca
sleep
at
night
he
keeps
on
hearing
shells
and
if
he
does
sleep
he
dreams
about
them
and
wakes
up
screaming
awful
to
hear
a
man
scream
anne
queenie
must
come
home
and
look
after
him
my
nerves
are
going
i
ca
sleep
any
more
than
colin
i
lie
awake
waiting
for
the
scream
i
ca
take
the
responsibility
of
him
alone
i
ca
really
after
all
his
wife
and
she
made
him
go
out
and
fight
though
she
knew
what
eliot
said
it
would
do
to
him
it
too
cruel
that
it
should
have
happened
to
of
all
people
that
woman
come
your
loving
adeline
fielding
nieuport
darling
auntie
i
so
sorry
about
dear
and
i
quite
agree
that
queenie
ought
to
go
back
and
look
after
him
but
she
wo
she
says
her
work
here
is
much
more
important
and
that
she
ca
give
up
hundreds
of
wounded
soldiers
for
just
one
man
of
course
she
is
doing
splendidly
and
cutler
says
he
spare
her
and
she
be
simply
thrown
away
on
one
case
they
think
colin
people
ought
to
look
after
him
it
does
seem
to
matter
to
either
of
them
that
he
her
husband
they
got
into
the
way
of
looking
at
everybody
as
a
case
they
say
it
not
even
as
if
colin
could
be
got
better
so
as
to
be
sent
out
to
fight
again
it
would
be
sheer
waste
of
queenie
but
cutler
has
given
me
leave
to
go
over
and
see
him
i
shall
get
to
wyck
as
soon
as
this
letter
dear
i
wish
i
could
do
something
for
him
i
feel
as
if
we
could
never
never
do
too
much
after
all
he
been
through
fancy
eliot
knowing
exactly
what
would
happen
your
loving
anne
nieuport
dear
anne
now
that
you
gone
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
it
would
be
just
as
well
if
you
did
come
back
i
got
a
man
to
take
your
place
queenie
picked
him
up
at
dunkirk
the
day
you
sailed
and
he
doing
very
well
the
fact
is
we
getting
on
much
better
since
you
left
perfect
peace
now
you
and
queenie
did
hit
it
off
you
know
and
for
a
job
like
ours
it
absolutely
essential
that
everybody
should
pull
together
like
one
it
does
do
to
have
two
in
a
corps
always
at
loggerheads
i
do
like
to
lose
you
and
i
know
you
done
splendidly
but
i
got
to
choose
between
queenie
and
you
and
i
must
keep
her
if
it
only
because
she
worked
with
me
all
the
time
so
now
that
you
made
the
break
i
take
the
opportunity
of
asking
you
to
resign
personally
i
sorry
but
the
good
of
the
corps
must
come
before
everything
sincerely
yours
robert
cutler
the
manor
gloucestershire
dear
dicky
this
is
only
to
say
as
i
sha
see
you
again
cutler
fired
me
out
of
the
corps
he
because
queenie
and
i
do
hit
it
off
i
should
have
thought
that
was
my
fault
but
he
seems
to
think
it
is
he
says
been
perfect
peace
since
i
left
well
we
had
some
tremendous
times
together
and
i
wish
we
could
have
gone
on
and
good
luck
yours
ever
anne
severn
poor
colin
fielding
in
an
awful
state
but
he
been
a
bit
better
since
i
came
even
if
cutler
let
me
come
back
i
could
leave
him
this
is
my
job
the
queer
thing
is
afraid
of
queenie
so
it
just
as
well
she
did
come
home
nieuport
dear
old
thing
we
all
furious
here
at
the
way
you
been
treated
i
resigned
as
a
protest
and
i
going
into
the
so
has
miss
mullins
resigned
i
mean
so
queenie
the
only
woman
left
in
the
corps
that
suit
her
down
to
the
ground
i
gave
myself
the
treat
of
telling
cutler
what
i
jolly
well
think
of
him
but
of
course
you
know
she
made
him
hoof
you
out
she
been
trying
for
it
ever
since
you
joined
it
all
rot
his
saying
you
did
hit
it
off
with
her
when
everybody
knows
you
were
a
perfect
angel
to
her
why
you
backed
her
every
time
when
we
were
all
going
for
her
it
quite
true
that
the
peace
of
god
has
settled
on
the
corps
since
you
left
it
but
that
only
because
queenie
does
rage
round
any
more
you
observe
that
she
never
went
for
miss
mullins
because
miss
mullins
kept
well
out
of
the
line
of
fire
and
if
you
had
jolly
well
distinguished
yourself
there
she
have
let
you
alone
too
the
real
trouble
began
that
day
you
were
at
dixmude
it
was
a
bit
because
she
was
afraid
you
be
killed
queenie
does
want
you
about
when
the
war
medals
are
handed
round
everybody
sees
that
but
old
cutler
he
too
much
gone
on
her
to
see
anything
she
can
twist
him
round
and
round
and
tie
him
up
in
knots
but
cutler
is
in
it
now
queenie
turned
him
down
for
that
young
noel
fenwick
who
got
your
job
cutler
nose
was
a
sight
i
can
tell
you
well
i
not
surprised
that
queenie
husband
funks
her
a
terror
worse
than
war
and
good
luck
old
thing
till
we
meet
again
yours
ever
dicky
cartwright
vii
adeline
i
they
would
never
know
what
it
cost
her
to
come
back
and
look
after
colin
that
knowledge
was
beyond
adeline
fielding
she
congratulated
anne
and
expected
anne
to
congratulate
herself
on
being
well
out
of
it
her
safety
was
revolting
and
humiliating
to
anne
when
she
thought
of
queenie
and
cutler
and
dicky
and
eliot
and
jerrold
and
all
the
allied
armies
in
the
thick
of
it
she
had
left
a
world
where
life
was
lived
at
its
highest
pitch
of
intensity
for
a
world
where
people
were
only
to
be
safe
from
the
chance
of
sudden
violent
death
was
to
be
only
her
one
consolation
had
been
that
now
she
would
see
jerrold
but
she
did
not
see
him
jerrold
had
given
up
his
appointment
in
the
punjaub
three
weeks
before
the
outbreak
of
the
war
his
return
coincided
with
the
retreat
from
mons
he
had
not
been
in
england
a
week
before
he
was
in
training
on
salisbury
plain
anne
had
left
wyck
when
he
arrived
and
before
he
got
leave
she
was
in
belgium
with
her
field
ambulance
and
now
in
october
of
nineteen
fifteen
when
she
came
back
to
wyck
jerrold
was
fighting
in
france
at
least
they
knew
what
had
happened
to
colin
but
about
eliot
and
jerrold
they
knew
nothing
anything
might
have
happened
to
them
since
they
had
written
the
letters
that
let
them
off
from
week
to
week
telling
them
that
they
were
safe
anything
might
happen
and
they
might
never
know
anne
fear
was
dumb
and
secret
she
could
talk
about
jerrold
she
lived
every
minute
in
terror
of
adeline
talking
of
the
cries
that
came
from
her
at
queer
unexpected
moments
between
two
cups
of
tea
two
glances
at
the
mirror
two
careful
gestures
of
her
hands
pinning
up
her
hair
i
can
not
bear
it
if
anything
happens
to
jerrold
anne
oh
anne
i
wonder
what
happening
to
jerrold
if
only
i
knew
what
was
happening
to
jerrold
if
only
i
knew
where
jerrold
nothing
so
awful
as
not
knowing
and
at
breakfast
over
toast
and
marmalade
anne
i
got
such
an
awful
feeling
that
something
happened
to
jerrold
i
sure
these
feelings
are
given
you
for
nothing
you
are
eating
anything
darling
you
eat
every
morning
at
breakfast
anne
had
to
look
through
the
lists
of
killed
missing
and
wounded
to
save
adeline
the
shock
of
coming
upon
or
eliot
name
every
morning
adeline
gazed
at
anne
across
the
table
with
the
same
look
of
strained
and
agonised
enquiry
every
morning
anne
heart
tightened
and
dragged
then
loosened
and
lifted
as
they
were
let
off
for
one
more
day
one
more
day
not
one
more
hour
one
minute
any
second
the
wire
from
the
war
office
might
come
ii
anne
never
knew
the
moment
when
she
was
first
aware
that
colin
mother
was
afraid
of
him
aunt
adeline
was
very
busy
making
swabs
and
bandages
every
day
she
went
off
to
her
war
hospital
supply
work
at
the
town
hall
and
anne
was
left
to
take
care
of
colin
she
began
to
wonder
whether
the
swabs
and
bandages
were
not
a
pretext
for
getting
away
from
colin
it
no
use
adeline
said
i
can
not
stand
the
strain
of
it
anne
he
worse
with
me
than
he
is
with
you
everything
i
say
and
do
is
wrong
you
do
know
what
it
was
like
before
you
came
anne
did
know
the
awful
thing
was
that
colin
could
bear
to
be
left
alone
day
or
night
he
would
lie
awake
shivering
with
terror
if
he
dropped
off
to
sleep
he
woke
screaming
at
first
pinkney
slept
with
him
but
pinkney
had
joined
up
and
old
wilkins
the
butler
was
impossible
because
he
snored
anne
had
her
old
room
across
the
passage
where
she
had
slept
when
they
were
children
and
now
as
then
their
doors
were
left
open
so
that
at
a
sound
from
colin
she
could
get
up
and
go
to
him
she
was
used
to
the
lacerating
unearthly
scream
that
woke
her
the
scream
that
terrified
adeline
that
made
her
cover
her
head
tight
with
the
to
shut
it
out
that
made
her
lock
her
door
to
shut
out
colin
once
he
had
come
into
his
mother
room
and
she
had
found
him
standing
by
her
bed
and
looking
at
her
with
the
queer
frightened
face
that
frightened
her
she
was
always
afraid
of
this
happening
again
anne
could
bear
to
think
of
that
locked
door
she
was
used
to
the
sight
of
colin
standing
in
her
doorway
to
the
watches
beside
his
bed
where
he
lay
shivering
holding
her
hand
tight
as
he
used
to
hold
it
when
he
was
a
child
to
anne
he
was
poor
again
the
little
boy
who
was
afraid
of
ghosts
only
more
abandoned
to
terror
more
unresisting
he
would
start
and
tremble
at
any
quick
unexpected
movement
he
would
burst
into
tears
at
any
sudden
sound
small
noises
whisperings
murmurings
creakings
soft
shufflings
irritated
him
loud
noises
the
slamming
of
doors
the
barking
of
dogs
the
crowing
of
cocks
made
him
writhe
in
agony
for
colin
the
deep
silence
of
the
manor
was
the
ambush
for
some
stupendous
crashing
annihilating
sound
sound
that
was
always
coming
and
never
came
the
droop
of
the
mouth
that
used
to
appear
suddenly
in
his
moments
of
childish
anguish
was
fixed
now
and
fixed
the
little
tortured
twist
of
his
eyebrows
and
his
look
of
anxiety
and
fear
his
head
drooped
his
shoulders
were
hunched
slightly
as
if
he
cowered
before
some
perpetually
falling
blow
on
fine
warm
days
he
lay
out
on
the
terrace
on
adeline
long
chair
on
wet
days
he
lay
on
the
couch
in
the
library
or
sat
crouching
over
the
fire
anne
brought
him
milk
or
beef
tea
or
benger
food
every
two
hours
he
was
content
to
be
waited
on
he
had
no
will
to
move
no
desire
to
get
up
and
do
things
for
himself
he
lay
or
sat
still
shivering
every
now
and
then
as
he
remembered
or
imagined
some
horror
and
as
he
was
afraid
to
be
left
alone
anne
sat
with
him
how
can
you
say
this
is
a
quiet
place
he
said
it
quiet
enough
now
it
is
it
full
of
noises
loud
thundering
noises
going
on
and
on
awful
noises
you
know
what
it
is
it
the
guns
in
france
i
can
hear
them
all
the
time
no
colin
that
is
what
you

my
head

better
already
if
i
get
better
they

me
out
again

to
be
sticking

the
hundredth
time

stuck

all
right
i
went
back
after
i
had
the
first
time
straight
back
into
the
trenches

was
at
the
very
end
of
the
fighting
that
i
got
it
again
then
i
could
go
back

could
move
i

colin
i

head

old
lie

about
her

thinking
she

such
beastly
things
you
ca
think
what
disgusting
things
she
said
she
says
them
to
everybody
she
does
mean
them
oh
does
she
is
that
mother
you
might
tell
her
i
sleeping
for
colin
was
afraid
of
his
mother
too
he
was
afraid
that
she
would
talk
that
she
would
talk
about
the
war
and
about
jerrold
colin
had
been
home
six
weeks
and
he
had
not
once
spoken
jerrold
name
he
read
his
letters
and
handed
them
to
anne
and
adeline
without
a
word
it
was
as
if
between
him
and
the
thought
of
jerrold
there
was
darkness
and
a
supreme
nameless
terror
one
morning
at
dawn
anne
was
wakened
by
colin
voice
in
her
room
anne
are
you
awake
the
room
was
full
of
the
white
dawn
she
saw
him
standing
in
it
by
her
bedside
my
head
awfully
queer
he
said
i
can
feel
my
brain
shaking
and
wobbling
inside
it
as
if
the
convolutions
had
come
undone
could
they
of
course
they
could
the
noise
might
have
loosened
them
it
is
your
brain
you
feel
colin
it
your
nerves
it
just
the
shock
still
going
on
in
them
is
it
never
going
to
stop
yes
when
you
stronger
go
back
to
bed
and
i
come
to
you
he
went
back
she
slipped
on
her
and
came
to
him
she
sat
by
his
bed
and
put
her
hand
on
his
forehead
there
it
stops
when
you
put
your
hand
on
yes
and
you
sleep
presently
to
her
joy
he
slept
she
stood
up
and
looked
at
him
as
he
lay
there
in
the
white
dawn
he
was
utterly
innocent
utterly
pathetic
in
his
sleep
and
beautiful
sleep
smoothed
out
his
vexed
face
and
brought
back
the
likeness
of
the
boy
colin
jerrold
brother
that
morning
a
letter
came
to
her
from
jerrold
he
wrote
do
worry
too
much
about
he
be
all
right
as
long
as
you
look
after
him
she
thought
i
wonder
whether
he
remembers
that
he
asked
me
to
but
she
was
glad
he
was
not
there
to
hear
colin
scream
iii
anne
can
sleep
said
adeline
colin
had
gone
to
bed
and
they
were
sitting
together
in
the
for
the
last
hour
of
the
evening
not
very
well
when
colin
has
such
bad
nights
do
you
think
he
ever
going
to
get
right
again
yes
but
it
take
time
a
long
time
very
long
probably
my
dear
if
it
does
i
do
know
how
i
going
to
stand
it
and
if
i
only
knew
what
was
happening
to
jerrold
and
eliot
sometimes
i
wonder
how
i
lived
through
these
five
years
first
robert
death
then
the
war
and
before
that
there
was
nothing
but
perfect
happiness
i
think
trouble
worse
to
bear
when
you
known
nothing
but
happiness
before
if
i
could
only
die
instead
of
all
these
boys
anne
why
ca
i
what
is
there
to
live
for
there
jerrold
and
eliot
and
colin
oh
my
dear
jerrold
and
eliot
may
never
come
back
and
look
at
poor
colin
is
the
colin
i
know
he
never
be
the
same
again
almost
rather
he
been
killed
than
that
he
should
be
like
this
if
lost
a
leg
or
an
arm
it
all
very
well
for
you
anne
he
is
your
son
you
do
know
what
he
is
said
anne
she
thought
he
brother
he
what
jerrold
loves
more
than
anything
no
said
adeline
everything
ended
for
me
when
robert
died
i
shall
never
marry
again
i
could
bear
to
put
anybody
in
robert
place
of
course
you
could
i
know
it
been
awful
for
you
auntie
i
could
bear
it
anne
if
i
did
believe
that
there
is
something
somewhere
i
ca
think
how
you
get
on
without
any
religion
how
do
you
know
i
have
any
well
you
no
faith
in
anything
have
you
ducky
i
do
know
what
i
faith
in
it
too
difficult
if
you
love
people
that
enough
i
think
it
keeps
you
going
through
everything
no
it
does
it
all
the
other
way
about
it
loving
people
that
makes
it
all
so
hard
if
you
did
love
them
you
would
care
what
happened
to
them
if
i
did
love
colin
i
could
bear
his
better
if
did
love
him
i
could
bear
it
at
all
i
expect
said
adeline
we
both
mean
the
same
thing
anne
thought
of
adeline
locked
door
and
in
spite
of
her
love
for
her
she
had
a
doubt
she
wondered
whether
in
this
matter
of
loving
they
had
ever
meant
the
same
thing
with
adeline
love
was
a
passive
state
that
began
and
ended
in
emotion
with
anne
love
was
power
in
action
more
than
anything
it
meant
doing
things
for
the
people
that
you
loved
adeline
loved
her
husband
and
her
sons
but
she
had
run
away
from
the
sight
of
robert
haemorrhage
she
had
tried
to
keep
back
eliot
and
jerrold
from
the
life
they
wanted
she
locked
her
door
at
night
and
shut
colin
out
to
anne
that
was
the
worst
thing
adeline
had
done
yet
she
tried
not
to
think
of
that
locked
door
i
suppose
said
adeline
you
leave
me
now
your
father
coming
home
john
severn
letter
lay
between
them
on
the
table
he
was
retiring
after
years
of
india
he
would
be
home
as
soon
as
his
letter
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
said
anne
i
shall
stay
as
long
as
you
want
me
if
father
wants
me
he
must
come
down
here
in
another
three
days
he
had
come
iv
he
had
grey
hair
now
and
his
face
was
a
little
lined
a
little
faded
but
he
was
slender
and
handsome
still
handsomer
more
distinguished
adeline
thought
than
ever
again
he
sat
out
with
her
on
the
terrace
when
the
october
days
were
warm
he
walked
with
her
up
and
down
the
lawn
and
on
the
flagged
paths
of
the
flower
garden
again
he
followed
her
from
the
to
the
library
where
colin
was
and
back
again
he
waited
ready
for
her
again
adeline
smiled
her
smile
she
had
the
look
of
a
young
girl
moving
in
perfect
happiness
she
was
perpetually
aware
of
him
one
night
colin
called
out
to
anne
that
he
could
sleep
people
were
walking
about
outside
under
his
window
anne
looked
out
in
the
full
moonlight
she
saw
adeline
and
her
father
walking
together
on
the
terrace
adeline
was
wrapped
in
a
long
cloak
she
held
his
arm
and
they
leaned
toward
each
other
as
they
walked
his
man
voice
sounded
tender
and
low
anne
called
to
them
i
say
darlings
would
you
mind
awfully
going
somewhere
else
colin
ca
sleep
with
you
prowling
about
there
adeline
voice
came
up
to
them
with
a
little
laughing
quiver
all
right
ducky
we
going
in
v
it
was
the
end
of
october

severn
had
gone
back
to
london
he
had
taken
a
house
in
montpelier
square
and
was
furnishing
it
one
morning
adeline
came
down
smiling
more
than
ever
anne
she
said

you
think
you
could
look
after
colin
if
i
went
up
to
evelyn
for
a
week
or
two

adeline
sister
she
lived
in
london
of
course
i
can
you
are
afraid
of
being
alone
with
him
afraid
of
what
do
you
take
me
for
well
adeline
meditated
it
is
as
if
benning
was
here
benning
was
the
housekeeper
that
make
it
all
right
and
proper
the
fact
is
i

winter

hardly
ever
get
away
as
you

at
the
end
of
the
first
week
she
wrote

loved

i
jilted
him

faithful
and
forgiving
and

patiently

anne
that

the
heart

so
i
shall
just
be
married
from
evelyn
house
give
us
your
blessing
there
a
dear
your
loving
adeline
fielding
anne
eyes
filled
with
tears
at
last
she
saw
adeline
fielding
completely
as
she
was
without
any
fascination
she
thought
marrying
to
get
away
from
colin
she
left
him
to
me
to
look
after
how
could
she
leave
him
how
could
she
anne
did
go
up
for
the
wedding
she
told
adeline
it
was
much
use
asking
her
when
she
knew
that
colin
could
be
left
or
if
you
like
that
ca
leave
him
her
father
wrote
back
your
aunt
adeline
thinks
you
reproach
her
for
leaving
colin
i
told
her
you
were
too
intelligent
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
you
agree
the
best
thing
she
could
do
for
him
she
no
more
capable
of
looking
after
colin
than
a
kitten
she
wants
to
be
looked
after
herself
and
you
ought
to
be
grateful
to
me
for
relieving
you
of
the
job
but
i
do
like
your
being
alone
down
there
with
colin
if
he
better
we
must
send
him
to
a
nursing
home
are
you
wondering
whether
we
going
to
be

long
as

have
her
own
way
which
is
what
i
mean
to
do
your
very
affectionate
father
john
severn
and
anne
answered
dearest
daddy
i
should
dream
of
reproaching
aunt
adeline
any
more
than
i
should
reproach
a
pussycat
for
catching
birds
look
after
her
as
much
as
you
please
shall
look
after
colin
whether
you
like
it
or
not
darling
you
ca
stop
me
and
i
wo
let
colin
go
to
a
nursing
home
it
would
be
the
worst
possible
place
for
him
ask
eliot
besides
he
better
i
ever
so
glad
you
going
to
be
happy
your
loving
anne
viii
anne
and
colin
i
autumn
had
passed
colin
couch
was
drawn
up
before
the
fire
in
the
anne
sat
with
him
there
he
was
better
he
could
listen
for
half
an
hour
at
a
time
when
anne
read
to
him
poems
short
stories
things
that
were
ended
before
colin
tired
of
them
he
ate
and
drank
hungrily
and
his
body
began
to
get
back
its
strength
at
noon
when
the
winter
sun
shone
he
walked
first
up
and
down
the
terrace
then
round
and
round
the
garden
then
to
the
beech
trees
at
the
top
of
the
field
and
then
down
the
hill
to
the
manor
farm
on
mild
days
she
drove
him
about
the
country
in
the
she
had
tried
motoring
but
had
had
to
give
it
up
because
colin
was
frightened
at
the
hooting
grinding
and
jarring
of
the
car
as
winter
went
on
anne
found
that
colin
was
no
worse
in
cold
or
wet
weather
he
could
stand
the
noise
and
rush
of
the
wind
but
his
strange
malady
took
no
count
of
rain
or
snow
he
shivered
in
the
clear
still
frost
but
it
braced
him
all
the
same
driving
or
strolling
she
kept
him
half
the
day
in
the
open
air
she
saw
that
he
liked
best
the
places
they
had
gone
to
when
they
were
children
the
manor
farm
fields
high
slaughter
and
hayes
mill
they
were
always
going
to
the
places
where
they
had
done
things
together
when
colin
talked
sanely
he
was
back
in
those
times
he
was
safe
there
there
if
anywhere
he
could
find
his
real
self
and
be
well
she
had
the
feeling
that
colin
future
lay
somewhere
through
his
past
if
only
she
could
get
him
back
there
so
that
he
could
be
what
he
had
been
there
must
be
some
way
of
joining
up
that
time
to
this
if
only
she
could
find
a
bridge
a
link
she
did
know
that
she
was
the
way
she
was
the
link
binding
his
past
to
his
present
bound
up
with
his
youth
his
happiness
his
innocence
with
the
years
before
queenie
and
the
war
she
did
know
what
queenie
had
done
to
him
she
did
know
that
the
war
had
only
finished
what
queenie
had
begun
that
was
colin
secret
the
hidden
source
of
his
fear
but
he
was
safe
with
anne
because
they
were
not
in
love
with
each
other
she
left
his
senses
at
rest
and
her
affection
never
called
for
any
emotional
response
she
took
him
away
from
his
fear
she
kept
him
back
in
his
childhood
in
his
boyhood
in
the
years
before
queenie
with
a
continual
do
you
remember
do
you
remember
the
walk
to
high
slaughter
do
you
remember
the
we
set
for
poor
pinkney
that
was
dangerous
for
poor
pinkney
was
at
the
war
do
you
remember
benjy
yes
rather
but
benjy
was
dangerous
too
for
jerrold
had
given
him
to
her
she
could
feel
colin
shying
he
had
a
butterfly
smut
he
said
had
he
do
you
remember
how
i
used
to
come
and
see
you
at
cheltenham
and
grannie
and
aunt
emily
and
how
you
used
to
play
on
their
piano
and
how
grannie
jumped
when
you
came
down
crash
on
those
chords
in
the
waldstein
do
you
mean
the
yes
the
last
movement
no
wonder
she
jumped
i
should
jump
now
he
turned
his
mournful
face
to
her
anne
i
shall
never
be
able
to
play
again
there
was
danger
everywhere
in
the
end
all
ways
led
back
to
malady
oh
yes
you
wall
when
you
quite
strong
i
shall
never
be
stronger
you
will
you
stronger
already
she
knew
he
was
stronger
he
could
sleep
three
hours
on
end
now
and
he
had
left
off
screaming
and
still
the
doors
were
left
open
between
their
rooms
at
night
he
was
still
afraid
to
sleep
alone
he
liked
to
know
that
she
was
there
close
to
him
instead
of
the
dreams
instead
of
the
sudden
rushing
crashing
horror
he
was
haunted
by
a
nameless
dread
dread
of
something
he
did
know
something
that
waited
for
him
something
he
could
face
something
that
hung
over
him
at
night
that
was
there
with
him
in
the
morning
that
came
between
him
and
the
light
of
the
sun
anne
kept
it
away
anne
came
between
it
and
him
he
was
unhappy
and
frightened
when
anne
was
not
there
it
was
always
you
going
anne
yes
but
i
coming
back
how
soon
and
she
would
say
an
hour
or
half
an
hour
or
ten
minutes
do
be
longer
no
and
then
i
do
know
how
it
is
anne
but
everything
seems
all
right
when
you
there
and
all
wrong
when
you
not

barker
jerrold

used
to
live
there
but
before
the
spring
of
nineteen
sixteen
barker
had
joined
up
wyck
manor
had
been
turned
into
a
home
for
convalescent
soldiers
and
anne
was
living
with
colin
at
the
manor
farm
half
of
her
ilford
land
had
been
taken
by
the
government
and
she
had
let
the
rest
together
with
the
house
and
orchard
instead
of
her
own
estate
she
had
the
manor
to
look
after
now
it
had
been
impossible
in
to
fill
barker
place
and
anne
had
become
jerrold
agent
she
had
begun
with
a
vague
promise
to
give
a
look
round
now
and
then
but
when
the
spring
came
she
found
herself
doing
barker
work
keeping
the
farm
accounts
ordering
fertilizers
calculating
so
many
hundredweights
of
superphosphate
of
lime
or
sulphate
of
ammonia
or
muriate
of
potash
to
the
acre
riding
about
on
barker
horse
looking
after
the
ploughing
plodding
through
the
furrows
of
the
hill
slopes
to
see
how
the
new
drillers
were
working
going
the
round
of
the
to
keep
count
of
the
sick
ewes
and
lambs
carrying
the
motherless
lambs
in
her
arms
from
the
fold
to
the
warm
kitchen
she
went
through
february
rain
and
snow
through
march
wind
and
sleet
and
through
the
mists
of
the
low
meadows
her
feet
were
loaded
with
earth
from
the
ploughed
fields
her
nostrils
filled
with
the
cold
rich
smell
of
the
wet
earth
the
rank
sharp
smell
of
swedes
the
dry
pungent
smell
of
straw
and
hay
the
thick
oily
woolly
smell
of
the
folds
the
warm
half
sour
smell
of
the
cattle
sheds
of
champed
fodder
of
milky
cow
breath
the
smell
of
hot
litter
and
dung
at
five
and
twenty
she
had
reached
the
last
clear
decision
of
her
beauty
dressed
in
riding
coat
and
breeches
her
body
showed
more
slender
and
more
robust
than
ever
rain
sun
and
wind
were
cosmetics
to
her
firm
smooth
skin
her
eyes
were
bright
dark
washed
with
the
clean
air
on
her
essex
farm
and
afterwards
at
the
war
she
had
learned
how
to
handle
men
sulky
curtis
who
grumbled
under
barker
rule
surrendered
to
anne
without
a
scowl
when
anne
came
riding
over
the
seven
acre
field
lazy
ballinger
pulled
himself
together
and
ploughed
through
the
two
last
furrows
that
he
would
have
left
for
next
day
in
barker
time
even
for
ballinger
and
curtis
she
had
smiles
that
atoned
for
her
little
air
of
imperious
command
and
colin
followed
her
about
the
farmyard
and
up
the
fields
till
he
tired
and
turned
back
she
would
see
him
standing
by
the
gate
she
had
passed
through
looking
after
her
with
the
mournful
look
he
used
to
have
when
he
was
a
little
boy
and
they
left
him
behind
he
would
stand
looking
till
anne
figure
black
on
her
black
horse
stood
up
against
the
skyline
from
the
curve
of
the
hill
it
dipped
it
dipped
and
disappeared
and
colin
would
go
slowly
home
at
the
first
sound
of
her
horse
hoofs
in
the
yard
he
came
out
to
meet
her
one
day
he
said
to
her
jerrold
be
jolly
pleased
with
what
done
when
he
comes
home
and
then
if
he
ever
can
be
pleased
with
anything
again
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
said
jerrold
name
that
what
been
bothering
me
he
went
on
i
ca
think
how
jerrold
going
to
get
over
it
you
remember
what
he
was
like
when
father
died
yes
she
remembered
well
what
the
war
going
to
do
to
him
look
what
it
done
to
me
he
minds
things
so
much
more
than
i
do
it
does
take
everybody
the
same
way
colin
i
do
suppose
jerrold
get
but
he
might
get
something
worse
something
that
hurt
him
more
he
must
mind
so
awfully
you
may
be
sure
he
wo
mind
anything
that
could
happen
to
himself
of
course
he
wo
but
the
things
that
happen
to
other
people
seeing
the
other
chaps
knocked
about
and
killed
he
minds
most
the
things
that
happen
to
the
people
he
cares
about
to
you
and
eliot
they
the
sort
of
things
he
ca
face
he
pretend
they
could
happen
but
the
war
so
big
that
he
ca
say
it
happening
he
got
to
stand
up
to
it
and
the
things
you
stand
up
to
do
hurt
you
i
feel
certain
he
come
through
all
right
that
was
the
turning
point
in
colin
malady
she
thought
if
he
can
talk
about
jerrold
he
getting
well
the
next
day
a
letter
came
to
her
from
jerrold
he
wrote
i
wish
to
goodness
i
could
get
leave
i
do
want
it
the
time
i
quite
prepared
to
stick
this
beastly
job
for
any
reasonable
period
but
a
whole
year
without
leave
it
a
bit
thick
about
colin
did
i
tell
you
he
be
all
right
and
it
all
anne
you
made
him
you
need
pretend
you
have
i
want
most
awfully
to
see
you
again
there
are
all
sorts
of
things
i
like
to
say
to
you
but
i
ca
write
she
thought
he
got
over
it
at
last
then
he
wo
be
afraid
of
me
any
more
somehow
since
the
war
she
had
felt
that
jerrold
would
come
back
to
her
it
was
as
if
always
deep
down
and
in
secret
she
had
known
that
he
belonged
to
her
and
that
she
belonged
to
him
as
no
other
person
could
that
whatever
happened
and
however
long
a
time
he
kept
away
from
her
he
would
come
back
at
some
time
in
some
way
she
could
distinguish
between
jerrold
and
her
sense
of
jerrold
and
as
nothing
could
separate
her
from
the
sense
of
him
nothing
could
separate
her
from
jerrold
himself
he
had
part
in
the
profound
and
secret
life
of
her
blood
and
nerves
and
brain
ix
jerrold
i
at
last
in
march
jerrold
had
got
leave
anne
was
right
jerrold
had
come
through
because
he
had
had
to
stand
up
to
the
war
and
face
it
he
could
turn
away
it
was
too
stupendous
a
fact
to
be
ignored
or
denied
or
in
any
way
escaped
from
and
as
he
had
to
take
it
he
took
it
laughing
once
in
the
thick
of
it
jerrold
was
sustained
by
his
cheerful
obstinacy
his
inability
to
see
the
things
he
did
want
to
see
he
admitted
that
there
was
a
war
the
most
appalling
war
if
you
liked
that
had
ever
been
but
he
refused
all
the
time
to
believe
that
the
allies
would
lose
it
he
refused
from
moment
to
moment
to
believe
that
they
could
be
beaten
in
any
single
action
he
denied
the
possibility
of
disaster
to
his
own
men
disaster
to
himself
possibly
probably
in
theory
but
not
in
practice
not
when
he
turned
back
in
the
rain
of
the
enemy
fire
to
find
his
captain
who
had
dropped
wounded
among
the
dead
when
he
swung
him
over
his
shoulder
and
staggered
to
the
nearest
stretcher
he
knew
he
would
get
through
it
was
inconceivable
to
jerrold
that
he
should
not
get
through
even
in
his
fifth
engagement
when
his
men
broke
and
gave
back
in
front
of
the
german
parapet
and
he
advanced
alone
shouting
to
them
to
come
on
it
was
inconceivable
that
they
should
not
come
on
and
when
they
saw
him
running
forward
by
himself
they
gathered
again
and
ran
after
him
and
the
trench
was
taken
in
a
mad
rush
jerrold
got
his
captaincy
and
two
weeks
leave
together
he
had
meant
to
spend
three
days
in
london
with
his
mother
three
days
in
yorkshire
with
the
durhams
and
the
rest
of
his
time
at
upper
speed
with
anne
and
colin
he
was
not
quite
sure
whether
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
durhams
more
than
anything
he
wanted
to
see
anne
again
his
last
unbearable
memory
of
her
was
wiped
out
by
five
years
of
india
and
a
year
of
war
he
remembered
the
child
anne
who
played
with
him
the
girl
anne
who
went
about
with
him
and
the
girl
woman
he
had
found
in
her
room
at
dawn
he
tried
to
join
on
to
her
the
image
of
the
anne
that
eliot
wrote
to
him
about
who
had
gone
out
to
the
war
and
come
back
from
it
to
look
after
colin
he
was
in
love
with
this
image
of
her
and
ready
to
be
in
love
again
with
the
real
anne
he
would
go
back
now
and
find
her
and
make
her
care
for
him
there
had
been
a
time
after
his
father
death
when
he
had
tried
to
make
himself
think
that
anne
had
never
cared
for
him
because
he
want
to
think
she
cared
now
that
he
did
want
it
he
was
sure
not
so
sure
as
he
was
about
little
maisie
durham
he
knew
maisie
cared
that
was
why
she
had
gone
out
to
india
it
was
also
why
she
had
been
sent
back
again
he
was
afraid
it
might
be
why
the
durhams
had
asked
him
to
stay
with
them
as
soon
as
he
had
leave
if
that
was
so
he
sure
whether
he
ought
to
stay
with
them
seeing
that
he
did
care
for
maisie
but
since
they
had
asked
him
well
he
could
only
suppose
that
the
durhams
knew
what
they
were
about
perhaps
maisie
had
got
over
it
the
little
thing
had
lots
of
sense
it
had
been
his
fault
in
the
beginning
maisie
caring
afterwards
perhaps
in
india
when
he
had
let
himself
see
more
of
her
than
he
would
have
done
if
he
had
known
she
cared
but
that
again
was
hardly
his
fault
since
he
did
know
you
do
see
these
things
unless
you
on
the
lookout
for
them
and
you
not
on
the
lookout
unless
you
a
conceited
ass
then
when
he
did
see
it
when
he
could
help
seeing
after
other
people
had
seen
and
made
him
see
it
had
been
too
late
but
this
was
five
years
ago
and
of
course
maisie
had
got
over
it
there
would
be
somebody
else
now
perhaps
he
would
go
down
to
yorkshire
perhaps
he
would
at
this
point
jerrold
realised
that
it
depended
on
anne
but
before
he
saw
anne
he
would
have
to
see
his
mother
and
before
he
saw
his
mother
his
mother
had
seen
anne
and
colin
ii
and
while
anne
in
gloucestershire
was
answering
jerrold
letter
jerrold
sat
in
the
of
the
house
in
montpelier
square
and
talked
to
his
mother
they
talked
about
colin
and
anne
what
colin
wife
doing
he
said
queenie
she
driving
a
field
ambulance
car
in
belgium
why
is
she
looking
after
colin
that
is
in
queenie
line
besides
besides
what
well
to
tell
the
truth
i
do
suppose
she
live
with
colin
after
after
well
after
colin
living
with
anne
jerrold
stiffened
he
felt
the
blood
rushing
to
his
heart
betraying
him
his
face
was
god
only
knew
what
awful
colour
you
do
mean
to
say
they
i
do
mean
to
say
i
blame
them
poor
darlings
what
were
they
to
do
but
he
almost
stammered
it
you
do
know
you
ca
know
it
does
follow
well
of
course
my
dear
they
have
me
you
do
shout
these
things
from
the
but
what
is
one
to
think
there
they
are
there
they
been
for
the
last
five
months
living
together
at
the
farm
absolutely
alone
anne
wo
leave
him
she
wo
have
anybody
there
if
you
tell
her
it
not
proper
she
laughs
in
your
face
and
colin
swears
he
wo
go
back
to
queenie
what
one
to
think
jerrold
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
he
did
know
his
mother
went
on
in
a
voice
of
perfect
sweetness
do
imagine
i
think
a
bit
the
worse
of
anne
she
been
simply
splendid
i
never
saw
anything
like
her
devotion
she
brought
colin
round
out
of
the
most
appalling
state
we
no
business
to
complain
of
a
situation
we
all
benefitting
by
some
people
can
do
these
things
and
you
forgive
them
whatever
anne
does
or
does
do
she
always
be
a
perfect
darling
as
for
queenie
i
do
consider
her
for
a
minute
she
been
simply
asking
for
it
he
wondered
whether
it
were
really
true
it
did
follow
that
anne
and
colin
were
lovers
because
his
mother
said
so
even
supposing
that
she
really
thought
it
you
do
go
telling
everybody
i
hope
he
said
my
dear
jerrold
what
do
you
think
i
made
of
i
have
even
told
anne
father
i
only
told
you
because
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
i
see
you
want
to
put
me
off
anne
i
do
to
but
it
would
would
it
oh
lord
yes
if
it
was
true
perhaps
it
is
jerry
dear
it
may
be
awfully
immoral
of
me
but
for
colin
sake
i
ca
help
hoping
that
it
is
i
did
so
want
anne
to
marry
colin
really
he
only
right
when
he
with
her
and
if
queenie
divorces
him
i
suppose
she
will
but
mother
you
going
ahead
you
may
be
quite
wrong
i
may
you
can
only
suppose
how
on
earth
am
i
to
know
i
ca
ask
them
no
you
ca
ask
them
of
course
he
could
he
could
go
to
colin
and
say
are
you
lover
he
could
go
to
anne
and
say
are
you
colin
mistress
if
they
wanted
us
to
know
said
adeline
they
have
told
us
there
you
are
supposing
it
is
true
do
you
imagine
he
cares
for
her
yes
jerrold
i
quite
quite
sure
of
that
i
was
down
there
last
week
and
saw
them
he
ca
bear
her
out
of
his
sight
one
minute
he
not
care
and
anne
oh
well
anne
is
going
to
give
herself
away
but
i
certain
would
she
stick
down
there
with
everybody
watching
them
and
thinking
things
and
talking
if
she
did
care
so
much
that
nothing
matters
but
would
she
would
she
the
best
of
his
mother
was
that
in
these
matters
her
mind
jumped
to
meet
yours
halfway
you
had
got
to
put
things
into
words
my
dear
if
you
think
she
would
supposing
she
cared
enough
you
do
know
anne
i
shall
go
down
he
said
and
see
her
if
you
do
for
goodness
sake
be
careful
even
supposing
nothing
in
it
you
must
let
colin
see
you
think
there
is
he
feel
then
that
he
ought
to
leave
her
for
fear
of
compromising
her
and
if
he
leaves
her
he
be
as
bad
as
ever
again
and
ca
manage
him
nobody
can
manage
him
but
anne
that
how
they
tied
our
hands
we
ca
say
anything
i
see
after
all
jerrold
it
very
simple
if
they
innocent
we
must
leave
them
in
their
innocence
and
if
they
not
if
they
not
well
we
must
leave
them
in
jerrold
laughed
but
he
was
not
in
the
least
amused
iii
he
went
down
to
wyck
the
next
day
he
could
wait
till
the
day
after
not
that
he
had
the
smallest
hope
of
anne
now
even
if
his
suspicion
were
unfounded
she
had
made
it
sufficiently
clear
to
him
that
anne
was
necessary
to
colin
and
that
being
so
the
chances
were
that
colin
cared
for
her
in
these
matters
his
mother
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
be
utterly
mistaken
on
every
account
therefore
he
must
be
prepared
to
give
anne
up
he
could
take
her
away
from
colin
and
he
if
he
could
it
was
his
own
fault
what
was
done
was
done
six
years
ago
he
should
have
loved
anne
then
going
down
in
the
train
he
thought
of
her
a
little
girl
with
short
black
hair
holding
a
rabbit
against
her
breast
a
little
girl
with
a
sweet
mouth
ready
for
kisses
who
hung
herself
round
his
neck
with
sudden
loving
arms
a
big
girl
with
long
black
hair
tied
in
an
immense
black
bow
a
girl
too
big
for
kisses
a
girl
sitting
in
her
room
between
her
white
bed
and
the
window
with
a
little
black
cat
in
her
arms
her
platted
hair
lay
in
a
thick
black
rope
down
her
back
he
remembered
how
he
had
kissed
her
he
remembered
the
sliding
of
her
sweet
face
against
his
the
pressure
of
her
darling
head
against
his
shoulder
the
salt
taste
of
her
tears
it
was
inconceivable
that
he
had
not
loved
anne
then
why
had
he
why
had
he
let
his
infernal
cowardice
stop
him
eliot
had
loved
her
then
he
remembered
colin
little
running
after
them
down
the
field
calling
to
them
to
take
him
with
them
colin
hands
playing
colin
voice
singing
he
tried
to
think
of
queenie
the
woman
colin
had
married
he
had
no
image
of
her
he
could
see
nothing
but
colin
and
anne
she
was
there
alone
at
the
station
to
meet
him
she
came
towards
him
along
the
platform
their
eyes
looked
for
each
other
something
choked
his
voice
back
she
spoke
first
jerrold
anne
a
strange
thick
voice
deep
down
in
his
throat
their
hands
clasped
one
into
the
other
close
and
strong
colin
wanted
to
come
but
i
would
let
him
it
would
have
been
too
much
for
him
he
might
have
cried
or
something
you
must
mind
if
he
cries
when
he
sees
you
he
is
quite
right
yet
no
but
he
better
ever
so
much
better
he
can
do
things
on
the
farm
now
he
looks
after
the
lambs
and
the
chickens
and
the
pigs
it
good
for
him
to
have
something
to
do
jerrold
agreed
that
it
was
good
they
had
reached
the
manor
farm
now
do
take
any
notice
if
he
cries
she
said
colin
waited
for
him
in
the
hall
of
the
house
he
was
trying
hard
to
control
himself
but
when
he
saw
jerrold
coming
up
the
path
he
broke
down
in
a
brief
convulsive
crying
that
stopped
suddenly
at
the
touch
of
jerrold
hand
anne
left
them
together
iv
do
go
anne
colin
called
her
back
when
she
would
have
left
them
again
after
dinner
do
you
want
jerrold
to
yourself
she
said
we
do
want
you
to
go
do
we
jerrold
rather
not
jerrold
found
himself
looking
at
them
all
the
time
he
had
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
what
his
mother
had
told
him
was
not
true
but
he
was
sure
look
as
he
would
he
was
not
sure
if
only
his
mother
had
told
him
he
might
have
gone
on
believing
in
what
she
had
called
their
innocence
but
she
had
shown
him
what
to
look
for
and
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
help
seeing
it
at
every
turn
in
anne
face
in
the
way
she
looked
at
colin
the
way
she
spoke
to
him
in
her
kindness
to
him
her
tender
quiet
absorption
in
the
way
colin
face
turned
after
her
as
she
came
and
went
in
his
restlessness
when
she
was
not
there
in
the
peace
the
sudden
smoothing
of
his
vexed
brows
when
having
gone
she
came
back
again
supposing
it
were
true
that
they
he
could
bear
it
to
be
true
his
mind
struggled
against
the
truth
of
it
but
if
it
true
he
did
blame
them
so
far
from
being
untrue
or
even
improbable
it
seemed
to
jerrold
the
most
likely
thing
in
the
world
to
have
happened
it
had
happened
to
so
many
people
since
the
war
that
he
could
deny
its
likelihood
there
was
only
one
thing
that
could
have
made
it
impossible
if
anne
had
cared
for
him
and
what
reason
had
he
to
suppose
she
cared
after
six
years
after
he
had
told
her
he
was
trying
to
get
away
from
her
he
had
got
away
and
he
saw
a
sort
of
dreadful
justice
in
the
event
that
made
it
useless
for
him
to
come
back
if
anybody
was
to
blame
it
was
himself
himself
and
queenie
that
horrible
girl
colin
had
married
when
he
asked
himself
whether
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
anne
would
be
likely
to
do
he
thought
why
not
if
she
loved
him
if
she
wanted
to
make
him
happy
how
could
he
tell
what
anne
would
or
would
not
do
she
had
said
long
ago
that
he
could
that
she
might
do
anything
they
spent
the
evening
talking
by
fits
and
starts
with
long
silences
in
between
they
talked
about
the
things
that
happened
before
the
war
before
colin
marriage
the
things
they
had
done
together
they
talked
about
the
farm
and
anne
work
about
barker
and
curtis
and
ballinger
about
sutton
who
watched
them
from
her
house
across
the
road
sutton
had
once
been
colin
nurse
up
at
the
manor
she
had
married
old
sutton
after
his
first
wife
death
old
sutton
who
would
die
and
let
anne
have
his
farm
and
now
she
watched
them
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
what
they
might
do
next
poor
old
nanna
jerrold
said
goodness
knows
what
she
thinks
of
us
said
anne
it
does
matter
what
she
thinks
said
colin
and
they
laughed
they
laughed
and
jerrold
was
not
quite
sure
yet
but
before
the
night
was
over
he
thought
he
was
they
had
given
him
the
little
room
in
the
gable
it
led
out
of
room
and
there
on
the
chimneypiece
he
saw
an
old
photograph
of
himself
at
the
age
of
thirteen
holding
a
puppy
in
his
arms
he
had
given
it
to
anne
on
the
last
day
of
the
midsummer
holidays
nineteen
hundred
also
he
found
a
pair
of
anne
slippers
under
the
bed
and
caught
in
a
crack
of
the
one
long
black
hair
this
room
leading
out
of
colin
was
anne
room
and
colin
called
out
to
him
do
you
mind
leaving
the
door
open
jerry
i
ca
sleep
if
it
shut
v
it
was
jerrold
second
day
he
and
anne
climbed
the
steep
beech
walk
to
the
top
of
the
hillock
and
sat
there
under
the
trees
up
the
fields
on
the
opposite
rise
they
could
see
the
grey
walls
and
gables
of
the
manor
and
beside
it
their
other
beech
ring
at
the
top
of
the
last
field
they
were
silent
for
a
while
he
was
intensely
aware
of
her
as
she
turned
her
head
round
slowly
to
look
at
him
straight
and
full
and
the
sense
of
his
nearness
came
over
her
soaking
in
deeper
swamping
her
brain
her
wide
open
eyes
darkened
her
breathing
came
in
tight
short
jerks
her
nerves
quivered
she
wondered
whether
he
could
feel
their
quivering
whether
he
could
hear
her
jerking
breath
whether
he
could
see
something
queer
about
her
eyes
but
she
had
to
look
at
him
not
shyly
furtively
but
straight
and
full
taking
him
in
he
was
changed
the
war
had
changed
him
his
face
looked
harder
the
mouth
closer
set
under
the
mark
of
the
little
clipped
moustache
his
eyes
that
used
to
flash
their
blue
so
gayly
to
rest
so
lightly
were
fixed
now
dark
and
heavy
with
memory
they
had
seen
too
much
they
would
never
lose
that
dark
memory
of
the
things
they
had
seen
she
wondered
was
colin
right
had
the
war
done
worse
things
to
jerrold
than
it
had
done
to
him
he
would
never
tell
her
jerrold
she
said
suddenly
did
you
have
a
good
time
in
india
i
suppose
so
i
dare
say
i
thought
i
had
and
you
had
well
i
ca
conceive
how
i
could
have
had
you
mean
it
seems
so
long
ago
no
i
do
mean
that
you
forgotten
i
do
mean
that
either
silence
look
here
anne
i
want
to
know
about
colin
has
he
been
very
bad
yes
he
has
how
bad
so
bad
that
sometimes
i
was
glad
you
were
there
to
see
him
you
remember
when
he
was
a
kid
how
frightened
he
used
to
be
at
night
well
he
been
like
that
all
the
time
he
like
that
now
only
he
a
bit
better
he
does
scream
now
all
the
time
he
kept
on
worrying
about
you
he
only
told
me
that
the
other
day
he
seemed
to
think
the
war
must
have
done
something
more
frightful
to
you
than
it
had
done
to
him
he
said
because
you
mind
it
more
i
told
him
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
you
mind
most
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
it
any
good
minding
i
do
suppose
i
minded
more
than
the
other
chaps
if
anything
had
happened
to
you
or
him
or
eliot
i
have
minded
that
i
know
that
what
i
told
him
i
knew
you
come
through
eliot
was
dead
right
about
colin
he
knew
he
would
he
ought
never
to
have
gone
out
he
wanted
so
awfully
to
go
but
eliot
could
have
stopped
him
if
it
had
been
for
queenie
she
hunted
and
hounded
him
out
she
told
him
he
was
funking
fancy
colin
funking
what
queenie
like
she
like
that
she
never
funks
herself
but
she
wants
to
make
out
that
everybody
else
does
do
you
like
queenie
no
i
hate
her
i
do
mind
her
hounding
him
out
so
much
since
she
went
herself
i
mind
her
leaving
him
do
you
know
she
never
even
tried
to
come
and
see
him
good
god
what
a
beast
the
woman
must
be
what
on
earth
made
him
marry
her
he
was
frightfully
in
love
an
awful
sort
of
love
that
wore
him
out
and
made
him
wretched
and
now
he
afraid
for
his
life
of
her
i
believe
he
afraid
of
the
war
ending
because
then
she
come
back
and
if
she
does
come
back
she
may
try
and
take
colin
away
from
me
but
she
sha
she
ca
take
him
if
he
does
want
to
go
she
left
him
to
me
to
look
after
and
i
mean
to
stick
to
him
i
wo
have
him
frightened
and
made
all
ill
again
just
when
i
got
him
well
i
afraid
you
had
a
very
hard
time
not
so
hard
as
you
think
she
smiled
a
mysterious
quiet
smile
as
if
she
contemplated
some
happy
secret
he
thought
he
knew
it
anne
secret
do
you
think
it
funny
of
me
to
be
living
here
with
colin
he
laughed
i
suppose
it
all
right
you
always
had
pluck
enough
for
anything
it
does
take
pluck
to
stick
to
colin
moral
pluck
no
not
even
moral
you
were
always
fond
of
him
were
you
that
was
about
as
far
as
he
dare
go
she
smiled
her
strange
smile
again
yes
i
was
always
fond
of
him
you
see
he
wants
me
more
than
anybody
else
ever
did
or
ever
will
i
not
so
sure
about
that
but
he
always
did
get
what
he
wanted
oh
does
he
how
about
queenie
even
queenie
i
suppose
he
wanted
her
at
the
time
he
does
want
her
now
poor
colin
you
must
ask
me
to
pity
him
ask
you
he
hate
you
to
pity
him
i
hate
you
to
pity
i
should
dream
of
pitying
you
any
more
than
i
should
dream
of
criticising
you
oh
you
may
criticise
as
much
as
you
like
no
whatever
you
did
it
would
make
no
difference
i
should
know
it
was
right
because
you
did
it
it
would
be
i
do
heaps
of
wrong
things
but
is
right
i
sure
it
is
here
colin
she
said
he
had
come
out
to
look
for

he
so
old
and
feeble
she

they
all
right
nanny
you

it
is
the
right

kimber
kimber
my
cousing
nanny

the
manor
oh

kindness
i
sure
and
kimber
deserves
it
the
way
they
stuck
to
miss
anne
he
does
indeed
it
pretty
decent
of
them
i
see
about
that
before
i
go
thank
you
sir
sutton
and
me
thought
maybe
you
do
something
for
him
else
i
should
have
spoken
and
if
there
anything
i
can
do
for
miss
anne
i
do
it
i
always
looked
on
her
as
one
of
you
but
is
a
pity
all
the
same
you
must
say
that
nanny
i
tell
you
it
all
perfectly
right
well
i
shall
never
say
as
is
no
nor
think
it
you
can
trust
me
for
that
master
jerrold
he
thought
poor
old
nanny
she
lies
like
a
brick
vii
he
said
to
himself
that
he
would
never
know
the
truth
about
anne
and
colin
if
he
went
to
them
and
asked
them
he
would
be
no
nearer
knowing
they
would
have
to
lie
to
him
to
save
each
other
in
any
case
his
mother
had
made
it
clear
to
him
that
as
long
as
anne
had
to
look
after
colin
he
could
ask
them
if
they
were
innocent
their
innocence
must
be
left
undisturbed
if
they
were
not
innocent
well
he
had
lost
the
right
to
know
it
besides
he
was
sure
as
sure
as
if
they
had
told
him
he
knew
how
it
would
be
colin
wife
would
come
home
and
she
would
divorce
colin
and
he
would
marry
anne
so
far
as
jerrold
could
see
that
was
his
brother
only
chance
of
happiness
and
sanity
as
for
himself
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
now
but
clear
out
and
leave
them
and
as
he
had
no
desire
to
go
back
to
his
mother
and
hear
about
anne
and
colin
all
over
again
he
went
down
to
the
durhams
in
yorkshire
for
the
rest
of
his
leave
he
had
been
there
five
days
before
he
and
maisie
were
engaged
and
before
the
two
weeks
were
up
he
had
married
her
x
eliot
i
eliot
stood
in
the
porch
of
the
manor
farm
house
there
was
nobody
there
to
greet
him
behind
him
on
the
oak
table
in
the
hall
the
wire
he
had
sent
lay
unopened
it
was
midday
in
june
all
round
the
place
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
smell
of
the
mown
hay
and
from
the
broad
pasture
there
came
the
rattle
and
throb
of
the
eliot
went
down
the
road
and
through
the
gate
into
the
colin
and
anne
were
there

at
the
top
of
the
field

the
mower
mounted
up
on
the
iron
seat
white
against
the
blue
sky
colin
at
the
bottom
slender
and
tall
above
the
big
revolving
wheel
drove

rake
the
tedding
machine
driven
by
a
farm

went
between
its
rack
caught
the
hay
tossed
it
and
scattered
it
on
the
field
beside
the
long
glistening
swaths
the
cut
edge
of
the
hay
stood
up
clean
and
solid
as
a
wall
above
it
the
raised
plane
of
the
brushed
by
the
wind
quivered
and
swayed
whitish
green
greenish
white
in
a
long
shimmering
undulation
eliot
went
on
to
meet
anne
and
colin
as
they
turned
and
came
up
the
field
again
when
they
saw
him
they
jumped
down
and

eliot
said
anne
rather
he
gave
a
long
look
at
them
at
their
faces
at
their
clean
slender
grace
colin
in
his
cricketing
flannels
and
anne
in
her
coat
knickerbockers
and
grey
wideawake
colin
does
look
as
if
there
was
much
the
matter
with
him
he
might
have
been
farming
all
his
life
so
i
have
said
colin
considering

they
went
back
together
towards
the
house
ii
colin
and
anne

the
day
the
hay
in
the

and
carried
to
the
stackyard

and
anne
sat
out
under
the
apple
trees
in

said
i
expected

perfect
wreck

it
good
for
him
being
down
here

to
be
happy
in
he

he
knows
he
safe
with
me
very
safe
he
owes
it
to
you
that
he
sane
now
you
must
have
been
astonishingly
wise
with
him
it
did
take
much
wisdom
not
more
than
it
used
to
take
when
he
was
a
little
frightened
kid
that
all
he
was
when
he
came
back
from
the
war
eliot
the
point
is
that
you
have
treated
him
like
a
kid
you
made
a
man
of
him
again
you
given
him
a
man
life
and
a
man
work
that
what
i
want
to
do
when
he
trained
he
can
look
after
land
you
know
poor
barker
died
last
month
of
septic
pneumonia
the
camp
was
full
of
it
i
know
what
do
you
think
of
my
training
colin
it
all
right
for
him
anne
but
how
about
you
me
oh
all
right
you
need
worry
about
me
i
do
worry
about
you
and
your
father
worrying
dear
old
daddy
it
silly
of
him
as
if
anything
mattered
but
colin
matter
you
see
your
father
does
like
your
being
here
alone
with
him
he
afraid
of
what
people
may
think
i
not
i
do
care
what
people
think
they
no
business
to
no
but
they
will
and
they
do
you
know
what
i
mean
anne
you
i
suppose
you
mean
they
think
i
colin
mistress
is
that
it
i
afraid
it
is
they
ca
think
anything
else
it
beastly
of
them
i
know
but
this
is
a
beastly
world
dear
and
it
does
do
to
go
on
behaving
as
if
it
was
i
do
care
if
people
are
beastly
it
their
not
mine
the
beastlier
they
are
the
less
i
care
i
do
suppose
you
care
if
the
vicar
wife
wo
call
or
if
lady
corbett
and
the
hawtreys
cut
you
but
that
why
is
it
i
never
thought
about
it
i
too
busy
to
go
and
see
them
and
i
supposed
they
were
too
busy
to
come
and
see
me
i
certainly
do
care
if
it
was
people
you
cared
about
nobody
i
care
about
would
think
things
like
that
of
me
anne
dear
i
not
so
sure
then
it
shows
how
much
they
care
about
but
it
because
they
care
i
ca
help
it
they
may
care
but
they
do
know
they
ca
know
anything
about
me
if
they
think
that
and
you
honestly
do
mind
i
mind
what
think
but
you
do
think
it
eliot
do
you
i
good
lord
no
do
you
mind
what
mother
thinks
yes
i
mind
but
it
does
matter
very
much
it
would
matter
if
jerrold
thought
it
oh
eliot
he
i
do
suppose
he
thinks
precisely
that
but
i
pretty
sure
he
thought
you
and
colin
cared
for
each
other
what
makes
you
think
so
his
marrying
maisie
like
that
why
should
he
marry
her
because
it
you
he
cares
about
eliot
voice
was
quiet
and
heavy
she
knew
that
what
he
said
was
true
that
quiet
heavy
voice
was
the
voice
of
her
own
innermost
conviction
yet
under
the
shock
of
it
she
sat
silent
not
looking
at
him
looking
with
wide
fixed
eyes
at
the
pattern
the
apple
boughs
made
on
the
sky
how
do
you
know
she
said
presently
because
of
the
way
he
talked
to
mother
before
he
came
to
see
you
here
she
says
he
was
frightfully
upset
when
she
told
him
about
you
and
colin
she
told
him
apparently
what
did
she
do
it
for
eliot
what
does
mother
do
anything
for
i
imagine
she
wanted
to
put
jerrold
off
so
that
you
could
stick
on
with
colin
you
taken
him
off
her
hands
and
she
wants
him
kept
off
so
she
told
him
i
was
colin
mistress
mind
you
she
does
think
a
bit
the
worse
of
you
for
that
she
admires
you
for
it
no
end
do
you
suppose
i
care
what
she
thinks
it
her
making
jerrold
think
it
eliot
how
could
she
she
could
because
she
only
sees
things
as
they
affect
herself
do
you
believe
she
really
thinks
it
she
made
herself
think
it
because
she
wanted
to
but
why
why
should
she
want
to
i
told
you
why
she
afraid
of
having
to
look
after
colin
i
no
illusions
about
mother
she
always
been
like
that
she
would
see
what
she
was
doing
to
you
before
she
did
it
she
persuaded
herself
that
it
was
colin
and
not
jerrold
that
you
cared
for
and
she
do
it
deliberately
at
all
i
know
it
has
all
the
effect
of
low
cunning
but
it
is
it
just
one
of
her
sudden
movements
she
rush
into
it
on
a
blind
impulse
anne
saw
it
all
she
saw
that
adeline
had
slandered
her
to
jerrold
and
to
eliot
that
she
had
made
use
of
her
love
for
colin
which
was
her
love
for
jerrold
to
betray
her
that
she
had
betrayed
her
to
safeguard
her
own
happy
life
without
pity
and
without
remorse
she
had
done
all
of
these
things
and
none
of
them
they
were
the
instinctive
movements
of
her
funk
where
adeline
ease
and
happiness
were
concerned
she
was
one
incarnate
funk
you
could
think
of
her
as
a
reasonable
and
responsible
being
to
be
forgiven
or
unforgiven
it
does
matter
how
she
did
it
it
done
now
she
said
really
anne
it
was
too
bad
of
colin
he
ought
to
have
let
you
he
could
help
it
poor
darling
he
was
in
a
state
do
put
that
into
his
head
it
just
had
to
happen
i
do
care
eliot
if
it
was
to
be
done
again
i
do
it
only
if
i
known
i
could
have
told
jerrold
the
truth
the
others
can
think
what
they
like
it
only
make
me
stick
to
colin
all
the
more
i
promised
jerrold
i
look
after
him
and
i
shall
as
long
as
he
wants
me
it
serves
them
all
right
they
all
left
him
to
me
daddy
and
aunt
adeline
and
queenie
i
mean
and
they
ca
stop
me
now
mother
does
want
to
stop
you
it
your
father
i
write
and
tell
daddy
besides
it
too
late
if
i
left
colin
it
would
stop
the
scandal
my
reputation
gone
and
i
get
it
back
can
i
dear
anne
you
do
know
how
adorable
you
are
without
it
look
here
eliot
what
did
your
mother
tell
for
same
reason
to
put
me
off
too
they
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
across
their
memories
across
the
years
of
war
across
anne
agony
they
smiled
besides
its
courage
and
its
young
candid
cynicism
anne
smile
expressed
her
utter
trust
in
him
as
if
eliot
said
it
would
have
made
the
smallest
difference
would
it
have
no
anne
nothing
would
that
what
jerrold
said
and
thought
it
i
wondered
what
he
meant
he
meant
what
i
mean
the
moments
passed
ticked
off
by
the
beating
of
his
heart
time
and
his
heart
beating
violently
together
not
one
of
them
was
his
moment
not
one
would
serve
him
for
what
he
had
to
say
falling
so
close
on
their
intolerable
conversation
he
meant
to
ask
anne
to
marry
him
but
if
he
did
it
now
she
would
suspect
him
of
chivalry
it
would
look
as
if
he
wanted
to
make
up
to
her
for
all
she
had
lost
through
colin
as
if
he
wanted
more
than
anything
to
save
her
so
eliot
who
had
waited
so
long
waited
a
little
longer
till
the
evening
of
his
last
day
iii
anne
had
gone
up
with
him
to
wyck
manor
to
see
the
soldiers
ever
since
they
had
come
there
she
had
taken
cream
and
fruit
to
them
twice
a
week
from
the
farm
unaware
of
what
was
thought
of
her
she
never
knew
that
the
scandal
of
young
fielding
and
miss
severn
had
penetrated
the
convalescent
home
with
the
fruit
and
cream
and
if
she
had
known
it
she
would
not
have
stayed
away
people
beastliness
was
no
reason
why
she
should
go
where
she
wanted
where
she
had
always
gone
the
convalescent
home
belonged
to
the
fieldings
and
the
fieldings
were
her
dearest
friends
who
had
been
turned
into
relations
by
her
marriage
so
this
evening
absorbed
in
the
convalescents
she
never
saw
the
matron
queer
look
at
her
or
her
pointed
way
of
talking
only
to
eliot
eliot
saw
it
he
thought
it
does
matter
she
so
utterly
good
that
nothing
can
touch
her
all
the
same
if
she
marries
me
she
be
safe
from
this
sort
of
thing
they
had
come
to
the
dip
of
the
valley
and
the
manor
farm
water
let
go
up
the
beech
walk
he
said
they
went
up
and
sat
in
the
beech
ring
where
anne
had
sat
with
jerrold
three
months
ago
eliot
never
realised
how
repeatedly
jerrold
had
been
before
him
anne
he
said
it
more
than
five
years
since
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
is
it
eliot
do
you
remember
i
said
then
i
never
give
you
up
i
remember
unless
jerrold
got
me
you
said
well
he
has
got
me
i
would
want
you
to
tie
yourself
up
with
me
if
there
was
the
remotest
chance
of
jerrold
but
as
there
is
do
you
think
no
eliot
i
do
but
you
do
care
for
me
anne
a
little
i
know
you
do
i
care
for
you
a
great
deal
but
not
in
that
sort
of
way
i
not
asking
you
to
care
for
me
in
the
way
you
care
for
jerrold
you
may
care
for
me
any
way
you
please
if
you
only
marry
me
you
know
how
awfully
little
i
be
content
to
take
i
should
be
content
to
give
it
though
you
ought
to
have
anything
but
the
best
it
would
be
the
best
for
me
you
see
oh
no
eliot
it
would
you
only
think
it
would
because
you
an
angel
it
would
be
awful
of
me
to
give
so
little
when
i
take
such
a
lot
i
know
what
your
loving
would
be
if
you
know
you
must
have
thought
of
it
and
if
you
thought
of
it
i
only
thought
of
it
to
see
how
impossible
it
is
it
might
be
if
i
could
leave
off
loving
jerrold
but
i
ca
eliot
i
got
the
queerest
feeling
about
him
i
know
you
think
me
mad
when
he
gone
and
married
somebody
else
but
i
feel
all
the
time
as
if
he
had
as
if
he
belonged
to
me
and
always
had
and
i
to
him
whoever
married
it
is
jerrold
not
the
real
jerrold
the
fact
remains
that
she
married
him
no
not
him
only
a
bit
of
him
some
bit
that
does
matter
anne
darling
i
try
not
to
think
that
i
do
think
it
i
feel
it
down
there
deep
inside
me
i
always
felt
that
jerrold
would
come
back
to
me
and
he
came
back
then
there
was
colin
he
come
back
again
then
there
be
maisie
no
then
there
wo
be
maisie
there
wo
be
anything
if
he
really
comes
now
you
see
how
mad
i
am
now
you
see
how
awful
it
would
be
to
marry
me
no
anne
i
see
it
the
only
way
to
keep
you
safe
safe
from
what
safe
from
jerrold
i
do
want
to
be
safe
from
him
eliot
i
telling
you
this
because
you
trust
me
i
want
you
to
see
me
as
i
really
am
so
that
you
wo
want
to
marry
me
any
more
ah
that
not
the
way
to
make
me
nothing
you
say
makes
any
difference
nothing
you
could
do
would
make
any
difference
supposing
it
had
been
true
what
your
mother
said
would
that
no
if
you
given
yourself
to
colin
i
should
only
have
thought
it
was
your
goodness
it
would
have
been
good
because
you
did
it
how
queer
that
what
jerrold
said
then
he
love
me
i
told
you
he
loved
you
then
i
do
care
nothing
else
matters
that
all
you
have
to
say
to
me
yes
unless
i
lie
you
lie
for
jerrold
for
him
not
to
him
i
should
never
need
to
you
no
need
to
lie
to
me
dear
i
know
you
better
than
he
does
you
forget
that
i
did
think
what
he
thought
that
only
shows
that
he
knew
knew
what
what
i
am
what
i
might
do
if
i
really
cared
there
are
things
you
never
do
you
never
do
anything
mean
or
dishonourable
or
cruel
oh
you
do
know
what
i
do
do
worry
eliot
i
shall
be
too
busy
with
the
land
and
with
colin
to
do
very
much
i
not
worrying
all
the
same
he
wondered
which
of
them
knew
anne
best
he
or
anne
herself
or
jerrold
xi
interim
i
colin
thought
with
terror
of
the
time
when
queenie
would
come
back
from
the
war
at
any
moment
she
might
get
leave
and
come
if
she
had
not
had
it
yet
that
only
made
it
more
likely
that
she
would
have
it
soon
the
vague
horror
that
waited
for
him
every
morning
had
turned
into
this
definite
fear
of
queenie
he
was
afraid
of
her
temper
of
her
voice
and
eyes
of
her
crude
malignant
thoughts
of
her
hatred
of
anne
more
than
anything
he
was
afraid
of
her
power
over
him
of
her
vehement
exhausting
love
he
was
afraid
of
her
beauty
one
morning
early
in
september
the
wire
came
colin
shook
with
agitation
as
he
read
it
what
is
it
anne
said
queenie
she
got
leave
she
be
here
today
at
four
do
you
want
to
see
her
no
i
do
then
you
better
drive
over
to
kingden
and
look
at
those
bullocks
of
ledbury
i
do
know
anything
about
bullocks
they
ought
to
be
straight
lines
from
their
heads
to
their
tails
that
about
all
i
know
never
mind
you
have
gone
to
look
at
bullocks
and
you
can
tell
ledbury
i
coming
over
do
you
mind
driving
yourself
colin
did
mind
he
was
afraid
to
drive
by
himself
but
he
was
much
more
afraid
of
queenie
you
can
take
harry
and
leave
me
to
settle
queenie
colin
went
off
with
harry
to
chipping
kingden
and
at
four
queenie
came
her
hard
fierce
eyes
stared
past
anne
looking
for
colin
where
colin
she
said
he
had
to
go
out
but
he
be
back
before
dinner
presently
queenie
asked
if
she
might
go
upstairs
as
they
went
you
could
see
her
quick
inquisitive
eyes
sweeping
and
flashing
the
door
of
colin
room
stood
open
is
that
colin
room
yes
she
went
in

the
inner
door
and

into

gable
room

queenie
with
furious
calm

you
a
fool
if
you
say

you
a
liar
a
damned
liar
and
is
colin
mother
a
liar
too
yes
but
not
a
damned
one
it
would
serve
you
jolly
well
right
queenie
if

he

touch
your
case

so
rotten
not
half
so
rotten
as
you
look
when

close
together
anne
waited
on
queenie
with
every
appearance
of
polite
attention
queenie
ate
and
drank
in
long
fierce
silences
for
her
hunger
was
even
more
imperious
than
her
pride
i
do
to
eat
your
food
she
said
at
last
i
only
doing
it
because

how
cutler
much
the
same
as
when

quietly
but
her
face
was
red
and
that
johnnie
what
was
his
name
who
took
my
place
queenie
flush
darkened
she
was
holding
her
mouth
so
tight
that
the
thin
red
line
of
the
lips
faded
noel
fenwick
said
anne
suddenly
remembering
what
about
him
queenie
throat
moved
as
if
she
swallowed
something
big
and
hard
is
he
there
still
he
was
when
i
left
her
angry
defiant
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
open
doorway
you
could
see
she
was
waiting
for
colin
ready
to
fall
on
him
and
tear
him
as
soon
as
he
came
in
am
i
to
see
colin
or
not
she

as
she
rose

to
him
only
what
i
said
to

i
funk

for
him

is
well
enough

upset
him
horribly
and
i
do
see
what
good
it

you

i
not
going
to
live
with
him
after
this
you
can
tell
him
that
tell
him
i
do
want
to
see
him
or
speak
to
him
again
i
see
you
just
came
down
to
make
a
row
you
do
suppose
i
came
down
to
stay
with
you
two
queenie
was
so
far
from
coming
down
to
stay
that
she
had
taken
rooms
for
the
night
at
the
white
hart
in
wyck
anne
drove
her
there
ii
two
and
a
half
years
passed
anne
work
on
the
farm
filled
up
her
days
and
marked
them
her
times
were
ploughing
time
and
the
time
for
sowing
wheat
first
and
turnips
after
the
wheat
barley
after
the
turnips
sainfoin
grass
and
clover
after
the
barley
oats
in
the
field
this
year
in
the
field
the
next
lambing
time
calving
time
and
harrowing
washing
and
shearing
time
time
for
hoeing
hay
time
and
harvest
then
threshing
time
and
ploughing
again
all
summer
the
hard
fight
against
the
charlock
year
after
year
the
same
you
harrowed
it
out
and
ploughed
it
down
and
sprayed
it
with
sulphate
of
copper
you
sowed
vetches
and
winter
corn
to
crowd
it
out
and
always
it
sprang
up
again
flaring
in
bright
yellow
stripes
and
fans
about
the
hills
the
air
was
sweet
with
its
smooth
delicious
smell
always
the
same
pattern
of
the
fields
but
the
colors
shifted
the
slender
triangle
that
was
last
june
this
june
was
the
square
under
the
dark
comb
of
the
plantation
that
had
been
was
emerald
the
fan
beside
it
that
had
been
emerald
was
pink
by
august
the
emerald
had
turned
to
and
the
to
white
these
changes
marked
the
months
and
the
years
a
bright
patterned
imperceptibly
moving
measure
rolling
time
off
across
the
hills
seventeen
and
the
armistice
and
the
peace
iii
in
the
spring
of
that
year
anne
and
colin
were
still
together
at
the
manor
farm
he
was
stronger
but
though
he
did
more
and
more
work
every
year
he
was
still
unfit
to
take
over
the
management
himself
responsibility
fretted
him
and
he
tired
soon
he
could
do
nothing
without
anne
he
was
now
definitely
separated
from
his
wife
queenie
had
come
back
from
the
war
a
year
ago
as
soon
as
it
was
over
she
had
begun
to
rage
and
consult
lawyers
and
write
letters
two
or
three
times
a
week
threatening
to
drag
anne
and
colin
through
the
divorce
court
but
miss
mullins
once
the
secretary
of
cutler
field
ambulance
corps
recovering
at
the
farm
from
an
excess
of
war
work
reassured
them
queenie
she
said
was
only
bluffing
queenie
was
not
in
a
position
to
bring
an
action
against
any
husband
she
had
been
too
notorious
herself
miss
mullins
had
seen
things
and
she
intimated
that
no
defence
could
stand
against
the
evidence
she
could
give
and
in
the
end
queenie
left
off
talking
about
divorce
and
contented
herself
with
a
judicial
separation
colin
still
woke
every
morning
to
his
dread
of
some
blank
undefined
disaster
but
as
if
queenie
and
the
war
had
made
one
obsession
he
was
no
longer
haunted
by
the
imminent
crash
of
phantom
shells
it
was
settled
that
he
was
to
live
with
jerrold
and
maisie
when
they
came
back
to
the
manor
while
anne
stayed
on
by
herself
at
the
farm
every
now
and
then
eliot
came
down
to
see
them
he
had
been
sent
home
early
in
with
a
shrapnel
wound
in
his
left
leg
the
bone
shattered
he
obtained
his
discharge
at
the
price
of
a
permanent
limp
and
went
back
to
his
research
work
for
the
last
two
years
he
had
been
investigating
trench
fever
with
results
that
were
to
make
him
famous
but
that
was
not
for
another
year
in
february
jerrold
had
come
back
he
and
maisie
had
been
living
in
london
ever
since
he
had
left
the
army
filling
in
time
till
wyck
manor
would
be
no
longer
a
home
for
convalescent
soldiers
he
had
tried
to
crowd
into
this
interval
all
the
amusement
he
had
had
for
four
years
his
way
was
to
crush
down
the
past
with
the
present
to
pile
up
engagements
against
the
future
party
on
party
dances
on
suppers
and
suppers
on
plays
to
dine
every
evening
at
some
place
where
they
had
dined
before
to
meet
lots
of
nice
amusing
people
with
demobilised
minds
who
would
talk
to
him
about
the
war
to
let
himself
go
in
bursts
of
exquisitely
imbecile
laughter
never
to
be
quiet
for
an
hour
never
to
be
alone
with
himself
never
to
be
long
alone
with
maisie
after
the
first
week
of
it
this
sort
of
thing
ceased
to
amuse
him
but
he
went
on
with
it
because
he
thought
it
amused
maisie
there
was
something
he
missed
something
he
wanted
and
had
got
at
night
when
he
lay
awake
alone
with
himself
at
last
he
knew
that
it
was
anne
and
he
went
on
laughing
and
amusing
maisie
and
maisie
with
a
sweetness
laughed
back
at
him
and
declared
herself
amused
she
had
never
had
such
a
jolly
time
in
all
her
life
she
said
then
very
early
in
the
spring
maisie
went
down
to
her
people
in
yorkshire
to
recover
from
the
jolly
time
she
had
had
the
convalescent
soldiers
had
all
gone
and
wyck
manor
rather
worn
and
shabby
was
wyck
manor
again
jerrold
came
back
to
it
alone
xii
colin
jerrold
and
anne
i
he
went
through
the
wide
empty
house
looking
through
all
the
rooms
trying
to
find
some
memory
of
the
happiness
he
had
had
there
long
ago
the
house
was
full
of
anne
anne
figure
crossed
the
floors
before
him
her
head
turned
over
her
shoulder
to
see
if
he
were
coming
her
voice
called
to
him
from
the
doorways
her
running
feet
sounded
on
the
stairs
that
was
her
place
at
the
table
that
was
the
armchair
she
used
to
curl
up
in
just
there
on
the
landing
he
had
kissed
her
when
he
went
to
school
they
had
given
his
mother
room
to
maisie
and
they
had
put
his
things
into
the
room
beyond
his
father
room
everything
was
in
its
place
as
it
had
been
in
his
father
time
the
great
wardrobe
the
white
washstand
the
bed
he
had
died
on
he
saw
him
lying
there
and
anne
going
to
and
fro
between
the
washstand
and
the
bed
the
parrot
curtains
hung
from
the
windows
straight
and
still
jerrold
shuddered
as
he
looked
at
these
things
they
had
thought
that
he
would
want
to
sleep
in
that
room
because
he
was
married
because
maisie
would
have
the
room
it
led
out
of
but
he
could
sleep
in
it
he
could
stay
in
it
a
minute
he
would
never
pass
its
door
without
that
sickening
pang
of
memory
he
moved
his
things
across
the
gallery
into
anne
room
he
would
sleep
there
he
would
sleep
in
the
white
bed
that
anne
had
slept
in
he
told
himself
that
he
had
to
be
near
colin
there
was
only
the
passage
between
and
their
doors
could
stand
open
that
was
why
he
wanted
to
sleep
there
but
he
knew
that
was
not
why
he
wanted
to
sleep
there
because
there
was
no
other
room
where
he
could
feel
anne
so
near
him
where
he
could
see
her
so
clearly
when
the
dawn
came
she
would
be
with
him
sitting
in
her
chair
by
the
window
the
window
looked
to
the
west
to
upper
speed
and
the
manor
farm
house
the
house
was
down
there
behind
the
trees
and
somewhere
there
jutting
out
above
the
porch
was
the
window
of
anne
room
he
looked
at
his
watch
one
at
two
he
would
go
and
see
anne
ii
when
jerrold
called
at
the
manor
farm
house
anne
was
out
old
ballinger
came
slouching
up
from
the
farmyard
to
tell
him
that
miss
anne
had
gone
up
to
the
far
acres
field
to
try
the
new
tractor
the
far
acres
field
lay
at
the
western
end
of
the
estate
jerrold
followed
her
there
five
furrows
five
bright
brown
bands
on
the
sallow
stubble
marked
out
the
far
acres
into
five
plots
in
the
turning
space
at
the
top
corner
he
saw
anne
on
her
black
horse
and
colin
standing
beside
her
with
a
great
clanking
and
clanging
the
new
american
tractor
struggled
towards
them
up
the
hill
dragging
its
plough
it
stopped
and
turned
at
the
headland
as
jerrold
came
up
a
clear
light
wind
blew
over
the
hill
and
he
felt
a
sudden
happiness
and
excitement
he
was
beginning
to
take
an
interest
in
his
land
he
shouted
i
say
anne
you
look
like
napoleon
at
the
battle
of
waterloo
oh
not
waterloo
i
hope
i
going
to
win
battle
well
marengo
austerlitz
whatever
battles
he
did
win
does
curtis
understand
that
infernal
thing
young
curtis
sulky
and
stolid
on
his
driver
seat
stared
at
his
new
master
yes
he
been
taught
motor
mechanics
he
quite
good
at
it
if
only
he
do
what
you
tell
him
curtis
i
said
you
were
not
to
use
those
disc
coulters
for
this
field
i
had
three
smashed
in
two
weeks
they
no
earthly
good
for
stony
soil
tis
n
so
bad
as
it
is
at
the
east
end
miss
well
we
see
you
can
let
her
go
now
with
a
fearful
grinding
and
clanking
the
tractor
started
the
revolving
disc
coulter
cut
the
earth
the
three
great
shares
gripped
it
and
turned
it
on
one
side
but
the
earth
instead
of
slanting
off
clear
from
the
furrows
fell
back
again
anne
dismounted
and
ran
after
the
tractor
and
stopped
it
he
has
got
his
plough
set
right
she
said
it
too
deep
in
she
stooped
and
did
something
mysterious
and
efficient
with
a
lever
the
wheels
dipped
raising
the
shares
to
their
right
level
and
the
tractor
set
off
again
this
time
the
earth
parted
clean
from
the
furrows
with
the
noise
of
surge
and
three
slanting
glistening
waves
ran
the
length
of
the
field
in
the
wake
of
the
triple
plough
oh
jerrold
look
at
those
three
lovely
furrows
look
at
the
pace
it
goes
this
field
will
be
ploughed
up
in
a
day
or
two
colin
are
you
pleased
the
tractor
was
coming
towards
them
making
a
most
horrible
noise
no
he
said
i
do
like
the
row
it
makes
ca
i
go
now
i
seen
what
the
beastly
thing
can
do
yes
you
better
go
if
you
ca
stand
it
colin
went
with
quick
desperate
strides
down
the
field
away
from
the
terrifying
sound
of
the
tractor
they
looked
after
him
sorrowfully
he
not
right
yet
i
do
think
he
ever
be
able
to
stand
noises
you
must
give
him
time

time

had
three
years
it
i
must
just
keep
him
out
of
the
way
of
the
tractors
that
all
she
mounted
her
horse
and
went
riding
up
and
down
the
field
abreast
of
the
plough
jerrold
waited
for
her
at
the
gate
of
the
field
iii

great
hearth
under

arch
of

carved
stone

drawn
up
before

in
his
chair
by
the
hearth
reading

was
with
jerrold
at
the
manor
the
soft
drizzle
turned
to
a
quick
patter
of
rain
a
curtain
of
rain
fell
covering
the
grey
fields
between
the
farm
and
the
manor
cutting
her
off
she
was
listening
to
the
rain
when
she
heard

click
of
the
gate
and
feet
on
the
garden
path

stopped
on
the
flagstones
under
her
window
jerrold

the
stairs

was
in
the
room

how
nice
of
you
to
come
on
this
beastly
evening
that
why

so
rotten
for
you

alone
down
here
what
have
you
done
with
colin

there
was
much
the
matter
with
him
you
never
can
tell
he
ca
stand
those
tractors
we
must
keep
him
away
from
the
beastly

no
end
of
labour
and
labour
short

i
only
take
a
hand
at
hay
time
and
harvest
all
the
rest
of
the
year
it
just
riding
about
and
seeing
that
other
people
work
and
colin
does
half
of
that
now
all
the
same
i
think
it
about
time

another
barker

i
shall
never

that
colin
better
and
i
been
happier
than
i
ever
thought
i
could
have
been
happier
were
you
happy
then
she
did
answer
they
were
on
dangerous
ground
if
they
began
talking
about
happiness
if
i
gave
it
up
she
said
i

only
go
and
work
on
another
farm
would
you
jerrold
do
you
want
me
to
go
want
you

once
at
least
you

did
know
what
i
was
doing
if
i
had
known
i
should
have
done
it
i
ca
talk
about
that
anne
it
does
bear
thinking
about
no
but
jerrold
tell
me
the
truth
do
you
want
me
to
go
because
of
colin
colin
yes
because
of
what
your
mother
told
you
how
do
you
know
what
she
told
me
she
told
eliot
and
he
told
good
god
what
was
he
thinking
of
he
thought
it
better
for
me
to
know
it
it
better
how
could
it
be
i
ca
tell
you
jerrold
it
is
true
i
know
it
is
but
you
thought
it
was
when
did
i
think
then
when
you
came
to
see
me
did
i
yes
and
you
not
going
to
lie
about
it
now
well
if
i
did
i
paid
for
it
what
did
he
mean
paid
for
it
it
was
she
who
had
paid
when
did
you
know
it
was
true
she
said
three
months
after
when
eliot
wrote
and
told
me
it
was
too
late
then
if
only
you
told
me
at
the
time
why
did
you
but
i
did
know
you
thought
it
how
could
i
know
no
how
could
you
who
would
have
believed
that
things
could
have
happened
so
damnably
as
that
but
it
all
right
now
why
did
you
say
it
was
too
late
because
it
too
late
i
was
married
what
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
lied
when
i
told
you
it
made
no
difference
it
made
that
difference
if
i
had
thought
that
you
and
colin
were
if
i
thought
that
i
would
have
married
maisie
i
have
married
you
do
say
that
jerrold
well
you
asked
for
the
truth
and
there
it
is
she
got
up
and
walked
away
from
him
to
the
window
he
followed
her
there
she
spread
out
her
hands
to
the
cold
rain
it
raining
still
she
said
he
caught
back
her
hands
would
you
have
married
me
do
jerrold
do
it
cruel
of
you
he
was
holding
her
by
her
hands
you
tell
me
tell
me
let
go
my
hands
then
he
let
them
go
they
turned
back
to
the
fireplace
anne
shivered
she
held
herself
to
the
warmth
you
have
told
me
he
said
no
i
have
told
you
she
repeated
stupidly
that
because
you
that
because
you
love
me
you
do
love
me
i
always
loved
you
she
spoke
as
if
from
some
place
as
if
the
eternity
of
her
love
removed
her
from
him
put
her
beyond
his
reach
but
what
the
good
of
talking
about
it
she
said
all
the
good
in
the
world
we
owed
each
other
the
truth
we
know
it
now
we
know
where
we
are
we
need
humbug
ourselves
and
each
other
any
more
you
see
what
comes
of
keeping
back
the
truth
look
how
had
to
pay
for
it
you
and
me
would
you
rather
go
on
thinking
i
care
for
you
no
jerrold
no
i
only
wondering
what
we
to
do
next
next
yes
why
you
want
me
to
go
away
it
is
it
why
i
want
you
to
stay
i
want
you
to
leave
off
working
and
do
all
the
jolly
things
we
used
to
do
you
must
make
me
leave
off
working
it
my
only
chance
they
turned
restlessly
from
the
fireplace
to
the
couch
they
sat
one
at
each
end
of
it
still
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
the
fire
died
down
the
evening
darkened
in
the
rain
the
twilight
came
between
them
poignant
and
disquieting
dimming
their
faces
making
them
strange
and
wonderful
to
each
other
their
bodies
loomed
up
through
it
wonderful
and
strange
the
high
white
stone
glimmered
like
an
arch
into
some
inner
place
outside
from
the
church
below
the
farm
house
the
bell
tinkled
for
service
it
ceased
suddenly
they
rose
and
he
came
towards
her
to
take
her
in
his
arms
she
beat
down
his
hands
and
hung
on
them
keeping
him
off
do
jerry
please
please
do
hold
me
oh
anne
let
me
you
let
me
once
do
you
remember
we
ca
now
we
must
and
yet
she
knew
that
it
would
happen
in
some
time
in
some
way
but
not
now
not
like
this
we
must
do
you
want
me
to
take
you
in
my
arms
no
not
that
what
then
he
pressed
tighter
i
want
you
not
to
hurt
maisie
it
too
late
to
think
of
maisie
now
i
not
thinking
of
her
i
thinking
of
you
you
hurt
yourself
frightfully
if
you
hurt
her
she
wrenched
his
hands
apart
and
went
from
him
to
the
door
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
said
i
going
to
fetch
the
lamp
she
left
him
standing
there
a
few
minutes
later
she
came
back
carrying
the
lighted
lamp
he
took
it
from
her
and
set
it
on
the
table
and
now
now
you
going
back
to
colin
and
we
both
going
to
be
good
you
do
want
to
be
good
do
you
yes
but
i
do
see
how
we
going
to
manage
it
we
could
manage
it
if
we
did
see
each
other
if
i
went
away
anne
you
would
you
ca
mean
that
i
could
stand
not
seeing
you
you
could
stand
it
either
i
have
stood
it
i
can
stand
it
again
you
ca
not
now
it
all
different
i
swear
i
be
decent
i
say
another
word
if
only
you
wo
go
i
do
see
how
i
can
very
well
there
the
land
no
colin
must
look
after
that
i
go
when
the
ploughing
done
and
some
day
be
glad
i
went
go
go
you
find
out
then
their
tenderness
was
over
something
hard
and
defiant
had
come
in
to
them
with
the
light
he
was
at
the
door
now
and
you
come
back
he
said
you
see
you
come
back
xiii
anne
and
jerrold
i
when
he
was
gone
she
turned
on
herself
in
fury
what
had
she
done
it
for
why
had
she
let
him
go
she
did
want
to
be
good
she
wanted
nothing
in
the
world
but
jerrold
she
had
done
it
for
maisie
maisie
was
nothing
to
her
a
woman
she
had
never
seen
and
did
want
to
see
she
knew
nothing
of
her
but
her
name
and
that
was
sweet
and
vague
like
a
perfume
coming
from
some
place
unknown
she
had
no
sweet
image
of
maisie
in
her
mind
maisie
might
never
have
existed
for
all
that
anne
thought
about
her
what
did
she
do
it
for
then
why
did
she
take
him
when
he
gave
himself
when
she
knew
that
in
the
end
it
must
come
to
that
as
far
as
she
could
see
through
her
darkness
it
was
because
she
knew
that
jerrold
had
not
meant
to
give
himself
when
he
came
to
her
she
had
driven
him
to
it
she
had
made
him
betray
his
secret
when
she
asked
for
the
truth
at
that
moment
she
was
the
stronger
she
had
him
at
a
disadvantage
she
could
take
him
like
that
through
the
sudden
movement
of
his
weakness
before
she
surrendered
she
must
know
first
whether
jerrold
passion
for
her
was
his
weakness
or
his
strength
jerrold
did
know
yet
she
must
give
him
time
to
find
out
but
before
all
she
had
been
afraid
that
if
jerrold
hurt
maisie
he
would
hurt
himself
she
must
know
which
was
going
to
hurt
him
more
her
refusal
or
her
surrender
if
he
wanted
to
be
good
she
must
go
away
and
give
him
his
chance
and
before
the
ploughing
was
all
over
she
had
gone
she
went
down
into
essex
to
see
how
her
own
farm
was
getting
on
the
tenant
who
had
the
house
wanted
to
buy
it
when
his
three
years
lease
was
up
anne
had
decided
that
she
would
let
him
the
lease
would
be
up
in
june
her
agent
advised
her
to
sell
what
was
left
of
the
farm
land
for
building
which
was
what
anne
had
meant
to
do
she
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
whole
place
and
be
free
all
this
had
to
be
looked
into
she
had
not
been
gone
from
jerrold
a
week
before
the
torture
of
separation
became
unbearable
she
had
said
that
she
could
bear
it
because
she
had
borne
it
before
but
as
jerrold
had
pointed
out
to
her
it
was
the
same
thing
now
there
was
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
jerrold
going
away
from
her
because
he
did
want
her
and
her
going
away
from
jerrold
because
he
did
it
was
the
difference
between
putting
up
with
a
dull
continuous
pain
you
had
to
bear
and
enduring
a
sharp
agony
you
could
end
at
any
minute
before
she
had
only
given
up
what
she
could
get
now
she
was
giving
up
what
she
could
have
by
simply
going
back
to
wyck
she
loathed
the
flat
essex
country
and
the
streets
of
little
white
rough
cast
and
houses
on
the
ilford
side
where
the
clear
fields
had
once
lain
beyond
the
tall
elm
rows
she
was
haunted
by
the
steep
pattern
of
the
hills
round
wyck
and
the
grey
gables
of
the
manor
and
tore
at
her
together
till
her
heart
felt
as
if
it
were
stretched
out
to
breaking
point
she
had
only
to
go
back
and
she
would
end
this
pain
then
on
the
sixth
day
jerrold
wire
came
colin
ill
again
please
come
back
jerrold
ii
it
was
not
her
fault
and
it
was
not
jerrold
the
thing
had
been
taken
out
of
their
hands
she
had
not
meant
to
go
and
jerrold
had
not
meant
to
send
for
her
colin
must
have
made
him
they
had
lost
each
other
through
colin
and
now
it
was
colin
who
had
brought
them
together
colin
terror
had
come
again
again
he
had
the
haunting
fear
of
the
tremendous
rushing
noise
the
crash
always
about
to
come
that
never
came
he
slept
in
brief
fits
and
woke
screaming
eliot
had
been
down
to
see
him
and
had
gone
and
again
as
before
nobody
could
do
anything
with
him
but
anne
i
could
jerrold
said
and
eliot
could
eliot
made
me
send
for
you
they
had
left
colin
upstairs
and
were
together
in
the
he
stood
in
the
full
wash
of
the
sunlight
that
flooded
in
through
the
west
window
it
showed
his
face
drawn
and
haggard
and
discoloured
as
though
he
had
come
through
a
long
illness
his
mouth
was
hard
with
pain
he
stared
away
from
her
with
heavy
wounded
eyes
she
looked
at
him
and
was
frightened
jerrold
have
you
been
ill
no
what
makes
you
think
so
you
look
you
look
as
if
you
had
slept
for
ages
i
have
i
been
frightfully
worried
about
colin
have
you
any
idea
what
set
him
off
again
i
believe
it
was
those
infernal
tractors
he
would
go
out
with
them
after
you
left
he
said
he
have
to
as
long
as
you
were
there
and
he
could
stand
the
row
eliot
said
it
would
be
that
and
the
responsibility
the
feeling
that
everything
depended
on
him
i
see
i
ought
to
have
left
him
it
looks
like
it
what
else
did
eliot
say
oh
he
thinks
perhaps
he
might
be
better
at
the
farm
than
up
here
he
thinks
it
bad
for
him
sleeping
in
that
room
where
he
was
frightened
when
he
was
a
kid
he
says
it
all
hooks
on
to
that
what
more
he
says
he
may
go
on
having
these
relapses
for
years
any
noise
or
strain
or
excitement
bring
them
on
do
you
mind
his
being
at
the
farm
again
mind
of
course
i
do
if
i
to
look
after
him
the
land
be
very
much
easier
there
than
here
for
every
night
at
colin
bedtime
anne
came
up
to
the
manor
she
slept
in
the
room
that
was
to
be
maisie
when
colin
screamed
she
went
to
him
and
sat
with
him
till
he
slept
again
in
the
morning
she
went
back
to
the
farm
she
had
been
doing
this
for
a
week
now
and
colin
was
better
but
he
did
want
to
go
back
if
he
said
jerrold
did
mind
having
him
jerrold
wanted
to
know
why
he
did
want
to
go
back
and
colin
told
him
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
i
hurt
anne
enough
without
beginning
all
over
again
all
these
damned
people
here
think
i
her
lover
you
ca
help
that
you
not
the
only
one
that
hurt
her
we
must
try
and
make
it
up
to
her
that
all
how
are
we
going
to
do
it
my
god
i
do
know
i
shall
begin
by
cutting
the
swine
who
cut
her
that
no
good
she
does
care
if
they
do
cut
her
she
only
cares
about
us
she
done
everything
for
us
and
among
us
all
we
done
nothing
for
her
absolutely
nothing
we
ca
give
her
anything
we
have
got
anything
to
give
her
that
she
wants
jerrold
was
silent
presently
he
said
she
wants
sutton
farm
sutton
dying
i
shall
give
it
to
her
when
he
dead
you
think
that
make
up
no
colin
i
do
supposing
we
do
talk
about
it
any
more
all
right
i
say
when
maisie
coming
home
god
only
knows
i
do
he
wondered
how
much
colin
knew
iii
february
had
gone
they
were
in
the
middle
of
march
and
still
maisie
had
not
come
back
she
wrote
sweet
little
letters
to
him
saying
she
was
sorry
to
be
so
long
away
but
her
mother
wanted
her
to
stay
on
another
week
when
jerrold
wrote
asking
her
to
come
back
he
did
this
so
that
he
might
feel
that
he
had
really
played
the
game
she
answered
that
they
would
let
her
go
till
she
was
rested
and
she
was
quite
rested
yet
jerrold
imagine
she
was
the
least
bit
ill
only
rather
tired
after
the
racketing
it
would
be
heavenly
to
see
him
again
then
when
she
was
rested
her
mother
got
ill
and
she
had
to
go
with
her
to
torquay
and
at
torquay
maisie
stayed
on
and
on
and
jerrold
did
imagine
she
had
been
the
least
bit
ill
or
even
very
tired
or
that
lady
durham
was
ill
he
preferred
to
think
that
maisie
stayed
away
because
she
wanted
to
because
she
cared
about
her
people
more
than
she
cared
about
him
the
longer
she
stayed
the
more
obstinately
he
thought
it
here
was
he
trying
to
play
the
game
trying
to
be
decent
and
keep
straight
and
there
was
maisie
leaving
him
alone
with
anne
and
making
it
impossible
for
him
anne
had
been
back
at
the
farm
a
week
and
he
had
not
been
to
see
her
but
maisie
last
letter
made
him
wonder
whether
really
he
need
try
any
more
he
was
ill
and
miserable
why
should
he
make
himself
ill
and
miserable
for
a
woman
who
did
care
whether
he
was
ill
and
miserable
or
not
why
should
he
go
and
see
anne
maisie
had
left
him
to
her
and
on
sunday
morning
suddenly
he
went
there
had
been
a
sharp
frost
overnight
every
branch
and
twig
every
blade
of
grass
every
crinkle
in
the
road
was
edged
with
a
white
fur
of
rime
it
crackled
under
his
feet
he
drank
down
the
cold
clean
air
like
water
his
whole
body
felt
cold
and
clean
he
was
aware
of
its
strength
in
the
hard
tension
of
his
muscles
as
he
walked
his
own
movement
exhilarated
and
excited
him
he
was
going
to
see
anne
anne
was
not
in
the
house
he
went
through
the
yards
looking
for
her
in
the
stockyard
he
met
her
coming
up
from
the
sheepfold
carrying
a
young
lamb
in
her
arms
she
smiled
at
him
as
she
came
she
wore
her
farm
dress
knee
breeches
and
a
thing
like
an
old
trench
coat
and
looked
superb
she
went
bareheaded
her
black
hair
was
brushed
up
from
her
forehead
and
down
over
her
ears
the
length
of
it
rolled
in
on
itself
in
a
curving
mass
at
the
back
over
it
the
frost
had
raised
a
crisp
web
of
hair
that
covered
its
solid
smoothness
like
a
net
head
was
the
head
of
a
hunting
diana
it
might
have
fitted
into
the
sickle
moon
the
lamb
queer
knotted
body
was
like
a
grey
ligament
between
its
hind
and
fore
quarters
it
rested
on
anne
arms
the
long
black
legs
dangling
the
head
hung
in
the
hollow
of
her
elbow
this
is
colin
job
she
said
what
are
you
doing
with
it
taking
it
indoors
to
nurse
it
it
been
frozen
stiff
poor
darling
do
you
mind
looking
in
the
barn
and
seeing
if
you
can
find
some
old
sacks
there
he
looked
found
the
sacks
and
carried
them
following
her
into
the
kitchen
anne
fetched
a
piece
of
old
blanket
and
wrapped
the
lamb
up
they
made
a
bed
of
the
sacks
before
the
fire
and
laid
it
on
it
she
warmed
some
milk
dipped
her
fingers
in
it
and
put
them
into
the
mouth
to
see
if
it
would
suck
i
did
know
they
do
that
he
said
oh
they
suck
anything
when
you
had
them
a
little
time
climb
into
your
lap
like
puppies
and
suck
the
buttons
on
your
coat
its
mother
dead
and
we
shall
have
to
bring
it
up
by
hand
i
doubt
if
you
will
oh
yes
i
shall
save
it
it
can
suck
all
right
you
might
tell
colin
about
it
he
looks
after
the
sick
lambs
she
got
up
and
stood
looking
down
at
the
lamb
tucked
in
its
blanket
while
jerrold
looked
at
her
when
she
looked
down
anne
face
was
divinely
tender
as
if
all
the
love
in
the
world
was
in
her
heart
he
loved
to
agony
that
tender
face
she
raised
her
eyes
and
saw
his
fixed
on
her
heavy
and
wounded
and
his
face
strained
and
drawn
with
pain
and
again
she
was
frightened
jerrold
you
what
is
it
do
they
hear
us
he
glanced
at
the
open
door
they
ca
he
in
church
and
she
upstairs
in
the
bedrooms
ca
you
leave
that
animal
and
come
somewhere
where
we
can
talk
come
then
he
followed
her
out
through
the
hall
and
into
the
small
they
sat
down
there
in
chairs
that
faced
each
other
on
either
side
of
the
fireplace
what
is
it
she
repeated
have
you
got
a
pain
a
beastly
pain
how
long
have
you
had
it
ever
since
you
went
away
i
lied
when
i
told
you
it
was
colin
it
is
what
is
it
then
tell
me
tell
me
it
not
seeing
you
it
this
insane
life
we
leading
it
making
me
you
do
know
what
it
been
like
and
i
ca
keep
my
promise
i
i
love
you
too
damnably
oh
jerrold
does
it
hurt
as
much
as
that
you
know
how
it
hurts
i
do
want
you
to
be
hurt
but
darling
if
you
care
for
me
like
that
how
could
you
marry
maisie
because
i
cared
for
you
because
i
was
so
mad
about
you
that
nothing
mattered
i
thought
i
might
as
well
marry
her
as
not
but
if
you
did
care
for
her
i
did
i
do
in
a
way
maisie
awfully
sweet
besides
it
was
that
you
see
i
was
going
out
to
france
and
i
thought
i
was
bound
to
be
killed
nobody
could
go
on
having
the
luck
i
had
i
wanted
to
be
killed
so
you
were
sure
it
would
happen
you
always
thought
things
would
happen
if
you
wanted
them
i
was
absolutely
sure
i
was
never
more
sold
in
my
life
than
when
it
did
even
then
i
thought
it
would
be
all
right
till
eliot
told
me
then
i
knew
that
if
i
had
been
in
such
a
damned
hurry
i
might
have
married
you
poor
maisie
poor
maisie
but
she
does
know
and
if
she
did
i
do
think
mind
much
i
married
her
because
i
thought
she
cared
about
me
and
because
i
thought
i
be
killed
before
i
could
come
back
to
her
but
she
does
care
a
damn
so
you
need
bother
about
maisie
and
you
go
away
again
i
wo
go
away
as
long
as
you
want
me
that
all
right
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
must
be
off
they
be
coming
out
of
church
i
do
want
them
to
see
me
here
now
because
i
coming
back
in
the
evening
we
shall
have
to
be
awfully
careful
how
we
see
each
other
i
say
i
come
this
evening
may
i
yes
same
time
as
last
sunday
you
be
alone
then
yes
her
voice
sounded
as
if
it
did
belong
to
her
as
if
some
other
person
stronger
than
she
were
answering
for
her
when
he
had
gone
she
called
after
him
do
forget
to
tell
colin
about
the
lamb
she
went
upstairs
and
slipped
off
her
farm
clothes
and
put
on
the
frock
she
had
worn
when
he
last
came
to
her
she
looked
in
the
glass
and
was
glad
that
she
was
beautiful
iv
she
began
to
count
the
minutes
and
the
hours
till
jerrold
came
dinner
time
passed
all
afternoon
she
was
restless
and
excited
she
wandered
from
room
to
room
as
if
she
were
looking
for
something
she
could
find
she
went
to
and
fro
between
the
and
kitchen
to
see
how
the
lamb
was
getting
on
wrapped
in
its
blanket
it
lay
asleep
after
its
meal
of
milk
its
body
was
warm
to
the
touch
and
under
its
soft
ribs
she
could
feel
the
beating
of
its
heart
it
would
live
two
she
took
up
the
novel
she
had
been
reading
before
jerrold
had
come
and
tried
to
get
back
into
it
ten
minutes
passed
she
had
read
through
three
pages
without
taking
in
a
word
her
mind
went
back
and
back
to
jerrold
to
the
morning
of
today
to
the
evening
of
last
sunday
going
over
and
over
the
things
they
had
said
to
each
other
seeing
jerrold
again
with
every
movement
every
gesture
the
sudden
shining
and
darkening
of
his
eyes
and
his
tense
drawn
look
of
pain
how
she
must
have
hurt
him
it
was
his
looking
at
her
like
that
as
if
she
had
hurt
him
anne
never
could
hold
out
against
other
people
unhappiness
half
past
two
she
kicked
off
her
shoes
put
on
her
thick
boots
and
her
coat
and
walked
two
miles
up
the
road
towards
medlicote
for
no
reason
but
that
she
could
sit
still
it
was
not
four
when
she
got
back
she
went
into
the
kitchen
and
looked
at
the
lamb
again
she
thought
supposing
colin
comes
down
to
see
it
when
jerrold
here
but
he
would
come
jerrold
would
take
care
of
that
or
supposing
the
kimbers
stayed
in
they
would
they
never
did
and
if
they
did
why
not
why
should
jerrold
come
to
see
her
four
struck
she
had
the
fire
lit
in
the
big
upstairs
tea
was
brought
to
her
there
kimber
glanced
at
her
where
she
lay
back
on
the
couch
her
hands
hanging
loose
in
her
lap
you
tired
after
all
your
week
work
miss
a
little
and
i
dare
say
you
miss
mr
colin
yes
i
miss
him
very
much
no
doubt
he
be
coming
down
to
see
the
lamb
oh
yes
he
want
to
see
the
lamb
and
you
sure
you
do
mind
me
and
kimber
going
out
miss
not
a
bit
i
like
you
to
go
it
a
wonder
to
me
said
kimber
as
you
not
afraid
to
be
left
alone
in
this
house
but
kimber
says
miss
anne
she
afraid
of
nothing
and
i
do
suppose
you
are
what
with
going
out
to
the
war
and
all
there
not
much
to
be
afraid
of
here
that
there
is
not
unless
is
people
nasty
tongues
do
frighten
me
mrs
kimber
no
miss
i
should
think
not
indeed
and
no
reason
why
they
should
and
kimber
left
her
a
sound
of
pails
clanking
came
from
the
yard
that
was
minchin
the
cow
man
going
from
the
dairy
to
the
cow
sheds
milking
time
then
it
must
be
half
past
four
five
the
slamming
of
the
front
door
the
click
of
the
gate
and
the
kimbers
voices
in
the
road
below
as
they
went
towards
wyck
anne
was
alone
only
half
an
hour
and
jerrold
would
be
with
her
the
beating
of
her
heart
was
her
measure
of
time
now
what
would
have
happened
before
he
had
gone
again
she
did
know
she
did
try
to
know
it
was
enough
that
she
knew
herself
and
jerrold
that
she
had
humbugged
herself
or
him
pretending
that
their
passion
was
anything
but
what
it
was
she
saw
it
clearly
in
its
reality
they
could
go
on
as
they
were
in
the
end
something
must
happen
they
were
being
drawn
to
each
other
irresistibly
inevitably
nearer
and
nearer
and
anne
knew
that
a
moment
would
come
when
she
would
give
herself
to
him
but
that
it
would
come
today
or
or
at
any
time
she
did
not
know
it
would
come
if
it
came
at
all
when
she
was
not
looking
for
it
she
had
no
purpose
in
her
no
will
to
make
it
come
she
could
think
it
was
no
use
trying
to
the
thumping
of
her
heart
beat
down
her
thoughts
her
brain
swam
in
a
warm
darkness
every
now
and
then
names
drifted
to
her
out
of
the
darkness
colin
eliot
maisie
maisie
only
a
name
a
sound
that
haunted
her
always
like
a
vague
sweet
perfume
from
an
unknown
place
but
it
forced
her
to
think
what
about
maisie
it
would
have
been
awful
to
take
jerrold
away
from
maisie
if
she
cared
for
him
but
she
was
taking
him
away
she
could
take
away
what
maisie
had
never
had
and
maisie
did
care
for
jerrold
and
if
she
did
care
she
had
no
right
to
keep
him
she
had
nothing
but
her
legal
claim
besides
what
was
done
was
done
the
sin
against
maisie
had
been
committed
already
in
jerrold
heart
when
it
turned
from
her
whatever
happened
or
did
happen
afterwards
nothing
could
undo
that
and
maisie
would
suffer
she
would
know
her
thoughts
went
out
again
on
the
dark
flood
she
could
think
any
more
half
past
five
she
started
up
at
the
click
of
the
gate
that
was
jerrold
v
he
came
to
her
quickly
and
took
her
in
his
arms
and
her
brain
was
swamped
again
with
the
warm
heavy
darkness
she
could
feel
nothing
but
her
pulses
beating
beating
against
his
and
the
quick
droning
of
the
blood
in
her
ears
her
head
was
bent
to
his
breast
he
stooped
and
kissed
the
nape
of
her
neck
lightly
brushing
the
smooth
sweet
roseleaf
skin
they
stood
together
pressed
close
closer
to
each
other
he
clasped
his
hands
at
the
back
of
her
head
and
drew
it
to
him
she
leaned
it
hard
against
the
clasping
hands
tilting
it
so
that
she
saw
his
face
before
it
stooped
again
closing
down
on
hers
their
arms
slackened
they
came
apart
drawing
their
hands
slowly
reluctantly
down
from
each
other
shoulders
they
sat
down
she
on
her
couch
and
he
in
colin
chair
is
colin
coming
she
said
no
he
is
well
the
lamb
better
i
never
told
him
about
the
lamb
i
did
want
him
to
come
is
he
all
right
i
left
him
playing
the
darkness
had
gone
from
her
brain
and
the
tumult
from
her
senses
she
felt
nothing
but
her
heart
straining
towards
him
in
an
immense
tenderness
that
was
half
pity
are
you
thinking
about
colin
he
said
no
i
not
thinking
about
anything
but
you
you
know
why
i
was
happy
looking
after
colin
why
i
was
happy
working
on
the
land
because
he
was
your
brother
because
it
was
your
land
because

else
i
could
do
for
you

you
nothing
but
trouble
and
danger

in
all
conscience
for
you

worse
for
us
if

it
would
be
worse
for

so
long
as
you
let
off
she
came
over
to
him
and
slid
to
the
floor
and
crouched
beside
him
and
laid
her
head
against
his
knees
she
clasped
his
knees
tight
with
her
arms
i
do
want
you
to
be
hurt
she
said
i
ca
bear
you
to
be
hurt
but
what
can
i
do

like
that
close
do
go
she
stayed
pressing
her
face
down
tighter
rubbing
her
cheek
against
his
rough
tweed
he
put
his
arm
round
her
shoulder
holding
her
there
his
fingers
stroked
stroked
the
back
of
her
neck
pushed
up
through
the
fine
roots
of
her
hair
giving
her
the
caress
she
loved
her
nerves
thrilled
with
a
sudden
secret
bliss
jerrold
it
heaven
when
you
touch
me
i
know
it
hell
for
me
when
i
do

if
only
i
known
we
know
now
there
was
a
long
silence
now
and
again
she
felt
him
stirring
uneasily
once
he
sighed
and
her
heart
tightened
at
last
he
bent
over
her
and
lifted
her
up
and
set
her
on
his
knee
she
lay
back
gathered
in
his
arms
with
her
head
on
his
breast
satisfied
like
a
child
jerrold
do
you
remember
how
you
used
to
hold
me
to
keep
me
from
falling
in
the
goldfish
pond

how
i
kissed

a
brute
i
was
to
you
can
you
ever
forgive
me
i
forgave
you
long
ago
talk
of
punishments
do
talk
of
punishments
presently
they
left
off
talking
and
he
kissed
her
he
kissed
her
again
and
again
with
light
kisses
brushing
her
face
for
its
sweetness
with
quick
hard
kisses
that
hurt
with
slow
deep
kisses
that
stayed
where
they
fell
kisses
remembered
and
unremembered
longed
for
imagined
and
unimaginable
the
church
bell
began
ringing
for
service
short
notes
first
tinkling
and
tinkling
then
a
hurrying
and
scattering
of
sounds
sounds
falling
together
running
into
each
other
covering
each
other
one
long
throbbing
and
clanging
sound
and
then
hard
slow
strokes
measuring
out
the
seconds
like
a
clock
they
waited
till
the
bell
ceased
the
dusk
gathered
it
spread
from
the
corners
to
the
middle
of
the
room
the
tall
white
arch
of
the
jutted
out
through
the
dusk
anne
stirred
slightly
i
say
how
dark
it
getting
yes
i
like
it
do
get
the
lamp
they
sat
clinging
together
waiting
for
the
dark
the
window
panes
were
a
black
glimmer
in
the
grey
he
got
up
and
drew
the
curtains
shutting
out
the
black
glimmer
of
the
panes
he
came
to
her
and
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
the
couch
and
laid
her
on
it
she
shut
her
eyes
and
waited
xiv
maisie
i
he
did
know
what
he
was
going
to
do
about
maisie
on
a
fine
warm
day
in
april
maisie
had
come
home
he
had
motored
her
up
from
the
station
and
now
the
door
of
the
had
closed
on
them
and
they
were
alone
together
in
there
oh
jerrold
it
nice
to
see
you
again
she
panted
a
little
a
way
she
had
when
she
was
excited
awfully
nice
he
said
and
wondered
what
on
earth
he
was
going
to
do
next
he
had
been
all
right
on
the
station
platform
where
their
greetings
had
been
public
and
perfunctory
but
now
he
would
have
to
do
something
intimate
and
above
all
spontaneous
not
to
stand
there
like
a
stick
they
looked
at
each
other
and
he
took
again
the
impression
she
had
always
given
him
of
delicate
beauty
and
sweetness
she
was
tall
and
her
neck
bent
slightly
forward
as
she
walked
this
gave
her
the
air
of
bowing
prettily
of
offering
you
something
with
a
charming
grace
her
shoulders
and
her
hips
had
the
same
long
slenderly
sloping
curves
her
hair
was
mole
brown
on
the
top
and
turned
back
in
an
way
that
uncovered
its
hidden
gold
her
face
was
white
the
thin
bluish
whiteness
of
skim
milk
her
mauve
blue
eyes
looked
larger
than
they
were
because
of
their
dark
brows
and
lashes
and
the
faint
mauve
smears
about
their
lids
the
line
of
her
little
slender
nose
went
low
and
straight
in
the
bridge
then
curved
under
delicately
acquiline
its
nostrils
were
close
and
clean
cut
her
small
close
upper
lip
had
a
flying
droop
and
her
chin
curved
slightly
ever
so
slightly
away
to
her
throat
when
she
talked
maisie
mouth
and
the
tip
of
her
nose
kept
up
the
same
sensitive
quivering
play
but
maisie
eyes
were
still
they
had
no
sparkling
speech
they
listened
deeply
attentive
to
the
person
who
was
there
they
took
up
the
smile
her
mouth
began
and
was
too
small
to
finish
and
now
as
they
looked
at
him
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
take
her
in
his
arms
suddenly
at
once
in
another
instant
it
would
be
too
late
the
action
would
have
lost
the
grace
of
spontaneous
impulse
he
wondered
how
you
simulated
a
spontaneous
impulse
but
maisie
made
it
all
right
for
him
as
he
stood
waiting
for
his
impulse
she
came
to
him
and
laid
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
kissed
him
gently
on
each
cheek
her
hands
slid
down
they
pressed
hard
against
his
arms
above
the
elbow
as
if
to
keep
back
his
too
passionate
embrace
it
was
easy
enough
to
return
her
kiss
to
pass
his
arms
under
hers
and
press
her
slight
body
gently
with
his
cramped
hands
did
she
know
that
his
heart
was
not
in
it
no
she
knew
nothing
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
she
said
you
do
look
fit
do
i
oh
nothing
much
he
turned
away
from
her
sweet
eyes
that
hurt
him
at
least
he
could
bring
forward
a
chair
for
her
and
put
cushions
at
her
back
and
pour
out
her
tea
and
wait
on
her
he
tried
by
a
number
of
careful
deliberate
attentions
to
make
up
for
his
utter
lack
of
spontaneity
and
she
sat
there
drinking
her
tea
contented
pleased
to
be
back
in
her
happy
home
serenely
unaware
that
anything
was
missing
he
took
her
over
the
house
and
showed
her
her
room
the
long
room
with
the
two
south
windows
one
on
each
side
of
the
square
bay
above
the
porch
it
was
full
of
the
clear
april
light
maisie
looked
round
taking
it
all
in
the
panels
the
lovely
faded
persian
rugs
the
curtains
of
old
rose
damask
an
armchair
and
a
round
table
with
a
bowl
of
pink
tulips
on
it
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
bay
is
this
mine
this
heavenly
room
i
thought
so
he
was
glad
that
he
had
something
beautiful
to
give
her
to
make
up
she
glanced
at
the
inner
door
leading
to
his
father
room
is
that
yours
in
there
mine
no
that
door
locked
it
i
on
the
other
side
next
to
colin
show
me
he
took
her
into
the
gallery
and
showed
her
it
that
door
over
there
at
the
end
what
a
long
way
off
she
said
why
you
not
afraid
are
you
dear
me
no
could
anybody
be
afraid
here
poor
colin
pretty
jumpy
still
that
why
i
have
to
be
near
him
i
see
you
wo
mind
having
him
with
us
will
you
i
shall
love
having
him
always
i
hope
he
wo
mind
he
adore
you
of
course
now
show
me
the
garden
they
went
out
on
to
the
green
terraces
where
the
peacocks
spread
their
great
tails
of
yew
maisie
loved
the
peacocks
and
the
clipped
yew
walls
and
the
goldfish
pond
and
the
flower
garden
he
walked
quickly
afraid
to
linger
afraid
of
having
to
talk
to
her
he
felt
as
if
the
least
thing
she
said
would
be
charged
with
some
unendurable
emotion
and
that
at
any
minute
he
might
be
called
on
to
respond
to
be
sure
this
was
not
like
what
he
knew
of
maisie
but
everything
having
changed
for
him
he
felt
that
at
any
minute
maisie
might
begin
to
be
unlike
herself
she
was
out
of
breath
she
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
do
go
so
fast
jerry
i
want
to
look
and
look
they
went
up
on
to
the
west
terrace
and
stood
there
looking
velvet
grew
in
a
thick
hedge
under
the
terrace
wall
their
hot
sweet
smell
came
up
to
them
it
too
beautiful
for
words
she
said
i
glad
you
like
it
it
is
rather
a
jolly
old
place
it
the
most
adorable
place
i
ever
been
in
it
looks
so
good
and
happy
as
if
everybody
who
ever
lived
in
it
had
been
good
and
happy
i
do
know
about
that
it
was
a
hospital
for
four
years
and
it
has
quite
recovered
yet
it
all
a
bit
worn
and
shabby
i
afraid
i
do
care
i
love
its
shabbiness
i
do
want
to
forget
what
been
to
think
that
i
missed
seven
weeks
of
it
you
have
missed
much
we
had
beastly
weather
all
march
i
missed
seven
weeks
of
you
i
think
you
get
over
that
he
said
perversely
i
sha
it
left
a
horrid
empty
space
but
i
could
help
it
i
really
could
jerry
all
right
maisie
i
sure
you
could
torquay
was
simply
horrible
and
this
is
heaven
oh
jerry
dear
going
to
be
so
awfully
happy
he
looked
at
her
with
a
sudden
tenderness
of
pity
she
was
visibly
happy
he
remembered
that
her
charm
for
him
had
been
her
habit
of
enjoyment
and
as
he
looked
at
her
he
saw
nothing
but
sadness
in
her
happiness
and
in
her
sweetness
and
her
beauty
but
the
sadness
was
not
in
her
it
was
in
his
own
soul
women
like
maisie
were
made
for
men
to
be
faithful
to
them
and
he
had
not
been
faithful
to
her
she
was
made
for
love
and
he
had
not
loved
her
she
was
nothing
to
him
looking
at
her
he
was
filled
with
pity
for
the
beauty
and
sweetness
that
were
nothing
to
him
and
in
that
pity
and
that
sadness
he
felt
for
the
first
time
the
uneasy
stirring
of
his
soul
if
only
he
could
have
broken
the
physical
tie
that
had
bound
him
to
her
until
now
if
only
they
could
give
it
all
up
and
fall
back
on
some
innocent
immaterial
relationship
that
meant
no
unfaithfulness
to
anne
when
he
thought
of
anne
he
did
know
for
the
life
of
him
how
he
was
going
through
with
it
ii
maisie
had
been
talking
to
him
for
some
seconds
before
he
understood
at
last
he
saw
that
for
reasons
which
she
was
unable
to
make
clear
to
him
she
was
letting
him
off
he
would
have
to
go
through
with
it
as
jerrold
mind
never
foresaw
anything
he
did
want
to
see
so
in
this
matter
of
maisie
he
had
had
no
plan
not
that
he
trusted
to
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
in
its
very
nature
the
moment
would
have
an
inspiration
he
had
simply
refused
to
think
about
it
at
all
it
was
too
unpleasant
but
maisie
presence
forced
the
problem
on
him
with
some
violence
he
had
given
himself
to
anne
without
a
scruple
but
when
it
came
to
giving
himself
to
maisie
his
conscience
developed
a
sudden
sense
of
guiltiness
for
jerrold
was
essentially
faithful
only
his
fidelity
was
all
for
anne
his
marrying
maisie
had
been
a
sin
against
anne
its
sinfulness
disguised
because
he
had
had
no
pleasure
in
it
the
thought
of
going
back
to
maisie
after
anne
revolted
him
the
thought
of
anne
having
to
share
him
with
maisie
revolted
him
nobody
he
said
to
himself
was
ever
less
polygamous
than
he
at
the
same
time
he
was
sorry
for
maisie
he
did
want
her
to
suffer
and
if
she
was
not
to
suffer
she
must
not
know
and
if
she
was
not
to
know
they
must
go
on
as
they
had
begun
he
was
haunted
by
the
fear
of
maisie
knowing
and
suffering
the
pity
he
felt
for
her
was
poignant
and
accusing
as
if
somehow
she
did
know
and
suffer
she
must
at
least
be
aware
that
something
was
wanting
he
would
have
to
make
up
to
her
somehow
for
what
she
had
missed
he
would
have
to
give
her
all
the
other
things
she
wanted
for
that
one
thing
maisie
coldness
might
have
made
it
easy
for
him
nothing
could
move
jerrold
from
his
conviction
that
maisie
was
cold
that
she
was
incapable
of
caring
for
him
as
anne
cared
his
peace
of
mind
and
the
freedom
of
his
conscience
depended
on
this
belief
but
in
spite
of
her
coldness
maisie
wanted
children
he
knew
that
according
to
jerrold
code
maisie
children
would
be
an
injury
to
anne
a
perpetual
insult
but
anne
would
forgive
him
she
would
understand
she
would
want
to
hurt
maisie
so
he
went
through
with
it
and
now
he
made
out
that
mercifully
incredibly
he
was
being
let
off
he
would
have
to
go
on
he
stood
by
maisie
bed
looking
down
at
her
as
she
lay
there
she
had
grasped
his
hands
by
the
wrists
as
if
to
hold
back
their
possible
caress
and
her
little
breathless
voice
went
on
catching
itself
up
and
tripping
you
wo
mind
if
i
do
let
you
come
to
me
i
sorry
maisie
i
did
know
you
felt
like
that
about
it
i
do
it
is
because
i
do
love
you
it
just
my
silly
nerves
i
get
frightened
i
know
i
know
it
be
all
right
i
wo
bother
you
mother
said
i
ought
to
ask
you
she
said
you
would
understand
and
it
would
be
too
hard
for
you
it
no
of
course
it
wo
i
understand
perfectly
he
tried
to
sound
like
one
affectionately
resigned
decently
renouncing
not
as
though
he
felt
this
blessedness
of
relief
absolved
from
dread
mercifully
and
incredibly
let
off
but
maisie
sweetness
hated
to
refuse
and
frustrate
it
could
bear
to
hurt
him
she
held
him
tighter
jerrold
if
it
if
you
stand
it
you
must
mind
about
me
you
must
forget
i
ever
said
anything
it
nothing
but
nerves
i
shall
be
all
right
do
worry
you
a
darling
her
grasp
slackened
please
please
go
at
once
quick
as
he
went
she
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
she
could
feel
the
pain
coming
it
filled
her
with
an
indescribable
dread
every
time
it
came
she
thought
she
should
die
of
it
if
only
she
did
get
so
excited
excitement
always
brought
it
on
she
held
her
breath
tight
to
keep
it
back
ah
it
had
come
splinters
of
glass
sharp
splinters
of
glass
first
pricking
then
piercing
then
tearing
her
heart
her
heart
closed
down
on
the
splinters
of
glass
cutting
itself
at
every
beat
she
looked
under
the
pillow
for
the
little
silver
box
that
held
her
pearls
of
nitrate
of
amyl
she
always
had
it
with
her
ready
she
crushed
a
pearl
in
her
pocket
handkerchief
and
held
it
to
her
nostrils
the
pain
left
her
she
lay
still
iii
and
every
sunday
at
six
in
the
evening
or
nine
he
varied
the
hour
to
escape
suspicion
jerrold
came
to
anne
in
the
weeks
before
maisie
coming
and
after
anne
happiness
was
perfect
intense
and
secret
like
the
bliss
of
a
saint
in
ecstasy
of
genius
contemplating
its
finished
work
in
giving
herself
to
jerrold
she
had
found
reality
she
gave
herself
without
shame
and
without
remorse
or
any
fear
of
the
dangerous
risks
they
ran
their
passion
was
too
clean
for
fear
or
remorse
or
shame
she
thought
love
was
a
finer
thing
going
free
and
in
danger
than
sheltered
and
safe
and
bound
the
game
of
love
should
be
played
with
a
high
defiant
courage
you
were
not
fit
to
play
it
if
you
fretted
and
cowered
both
she
and
jerrold
came
to
it
with
an
extreme
simplicity
taking
it
for
granted
they
never
vowed
or
protested
or
swore
not
to
go
back
on
it
or
on
each
other
it
was
inconceivable
that
they
should
go
back
on
it
and
as
anne
saw
no
beginning
to
it
she
saw
no
end
all
her
past
was
in
her
love
for
jerrold
there
never
had
been
a
time
when
she
had
ceased
to
love
him
this
moment
when
they
embraced
was
only
the
meeting
point
between
what
had
been
and
what
would
be
nothing
could
have
disturbed
anne
conscience
but
the
sense
that
jerrold
did
belong
to
her
that
he
had
no
right
to
love
her
and
she
had
never
had
that
sense
they
had
belonged
to
each
other
always
from
the
time
when
they
were
children
playing
together
maisie
was
the
intruder
who
had
no
right
who
had
taken
what
did
belong
to
her
and
anne
could
have
forgiven
even
that
if
maisie
had
had
the
excuse
of
a
great
passion
but
maisie
did
care
so
anne
unlike
jerrold
was
not
troubled
by
thinking
about
maisie
she
had
never
seen
jerrold
wife
she
did
want
to
see
her
so
long
as
she
did
see
her
it
was
as
if
maisie
were
not
there
and
yet
she
there
next
to
jerrold
she
was
more
there
for
anne
than
the
people
she
saw
every
day
maisie
presence
made
itself
felt
in
all
the
risks
they
ran
she
was
the
hindrance
not
to
perfect
bliss
but
to
a
continuous
happiness
she
was
the
reason
why
they
could
only
meet
at
intervals
for
one
difficult
and
dangerous
hour
because
of
maisie
jerrold
instead
of
behaving
like
himself
with
a
reckless
disregard
of
consequences
had
to
think
out
the
least
revolting
ways
by
which
they
might
evade
them
he
had
to
set
up
some
sort
of
screen
for
his
sunday
visits
to
the
manor
farm
thus
he
made
a
habit
of
long
walks
after
dark
on
and
of
unpunctuality
at
meals
to
avoid
being
seen
by
the
cottagers
he
approached
the
house
from
behind
by
the
bridge
over
the
and
through
the
orchard
to
the
back
door
luckily
the
estate
provided
him
with
an
irreproachable
and
permanent
pretext
for
seeing
anne
for
jerrold
going
about
with
anne
over
the
manor
farm
had
conceived
a
profound
passion
for
his
seven
hundred
acres
at
last
he
had
come
into
his
inheritance
and
if
it
was
anne
severn
who
showed
him
how
to
use
it
so
that
he
could
never
separate
his
love
of
it
from
his
love
of
her
the
land
had
an
interest
of
its
own
that
soon
excited
and
absorbed
him
he
determined
to
take
up
farming
seriously
and
look
after
his
estate
himself
when
anne
had
sutton
farm
anne
would
teach
him
all
she
knew
and
he
could
finish
up
with
a
year
or
two
at
the
agricultural
college
in
cirencester
he
had
found
the
work
he
most
wanted
to
do
the
work
he
believed
he
could
do
best
all
the
better
if
it
brought
him
every
day
this
irreproachable
companionship
with
anne
his
conscience
was
appeased
by
maisie
coldness
and
jerrold
told
himself
that
the
life
he
led
now
was
the
best
possible
life
for
a
sane
man
his
mind
was
clear
and
keen
his
body
was
splendidly
fit
his
love
for
anne
was
perfect
his
companionship
with
her
was
perfect
their
understanding
of
each
other
was
perfect
they
would
never
be
tired
of
each
other
and
never
bored
he
rode
with
her
over
the
hills
and
tramped
with
her
through
the
furrows
in
all
weathers
at
times
he
would
approach
her
through
some
sense
sharper
than
sight
or
touch
that
gave
him
her
inmost
immaterial
essence
she
would
be
sitting
quietly
in
a
room
or
standing
in
a
field
when
suddenly
he
would
be
thus
aware
of
her
these
moments
had
a
reality
and
certainty
more
poignant
even
than
the
moment
of
his
passion
at
last
they
ceased
to
think
about
their
danger
they
felt
ironically
that
they
were
protected
by
the
legend
that
made
anne
and
colin
lovers
in
the
eyes
of
the
kimbers
and
nanny
sutton
and
the
vicar
wife
and
the
corbetts
and
hawtreys
and
markhams
jerrold
was
the
stern
guardian
of
his
brother
morals
they
were
saying
now
that
captain
fielding
had
put
a
stop
to
the
whole
disgraceful
affair
he
had
forced
colin
to
leave
the
manor
farm
house
and
he
had
taken
over
the
estate
in
order
to
keep
an
eye
on
his
brother
and
anne
severn
anne
was
not
concerned
with
what
they
said
she
felt
that
jerrold
and
she
were
safe
so
long
as
she
did
know
maisie
it
never
struck
her
that
maisie
would
want
to
know
since
nobody
else
did
iv
but
maisie
did
want
to
know
anne
and
for
that
reason
one
day
she
came
to
jerrold
with
the
visiting
cards
the
corbetts
and
hawtreys
have
called
shall
i
like
them
i
do
know
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
them
why
not
because
of
the
beastly
way
they
behaved
to
anne
severn
what
have
they
done
done
they
been
perfect
swine
they
cut
her
for
five
years
because
she
looked
after
colin
they
said
the
filthiest
things
about
her
what
sort
of
things
why
that
colin
was
her
lover
oh
jerrold
how
abominable
just
because
she
was
a
saint
anne
would
care
what
anybody
said
about
her
my
mother
left
her
all
by
herself
here
to
take
care
of
him
and
she
would
leave
him
she
thought
of
nothing
but
him
she
must
be
a
perfect
angel
she
is
but
about
these
horrible
people
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
do
what
you
like
do
want
to
know
them
i
thinking
what
would
be
best
for
anne
you
need
worry
about
anne
it
is
as
if
she
was
friend
but
she
if
she
yours
and
colin
i
mean
i
want
her
to
be
i
think
i
better
call
on
these
corbett
and
hawtrey
people
and
just
show
them
how
we
care
about
her
then
cut
them
dead
afterwards
if
they
decent
to
her
it
be
far
more
telling
than
if
i
began
by
being
rude
only
jerrold
how
absurd
i
do
know
anne
called
yet
she
probably
thinks
you
would
want
to
know
her
do
you
mean
because
of
what
they
said
that
the
very
reason
why
she
the
only
person
here
i
do
want
to
know
i
think
i
fell
in
love
with
the
sound
of
her
when
you
first
told
me
about
her
and
how
she
took
care
of
colin
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
make
up
we
must
have
her
here
a
lot
and
give
her
a
jolly
time
he
looked
at
her
maisie
you
really
rather
a
darling
i
not
but
i
think
anne
severn
must
be
shall
i
go
and
see
her
or
will
you
bring
her
i
think
perhaps
i
better
bring
her
first
he
spoke
slowly
considering
it
tomorrow
was
sunday
he
would
bring
her
to
tea
and
in
the
evening
he
would
walk
back
with
her
on
sunday
afternoon
he
went
down
to
the
manor
farm
he
found
anne
upstairs
in
the
big
oh
jerrold
darling
i
did
think
you
come
so
soon
maisie
sent
me
maisie
for
the
first
time
in
his
knowledge
of
her
anne
looked
frightened

jerrold

guesses
about
you

me

it
the
last
thing
she
think
of
absolutely
guileless
that
makes
it
worse
you
do
know
he
said
how
she
feels
about
you
she
furious
with
these
brutes
here
because
they
cut
you
she
says
she
cut
if
they
wo
be
decent
to
you
oh

and

but
i

hundred
times

she

what
on
earth

by
it

happened
oh

i
wonder
he
rose
smiling
down
at
her
come
he
said
do
let
be
late
she
went
v
in
the
garden
with
maisie
the
long
innocent
conversation
coming
back
and
back
maisie
sweetness
haunting
her
known
now
and
remembered
maisie
walking
in
the
garden
among
the
wall
flowers
and
tulips
between
the
clipped
walls
of
yew
showing
anne
her
flowers
she
stooped
to
lift
their
faces
to
caress
them
with
her
little
thin
white
fingers
i
do
know
why
i
showing
you
round
she
said
you
know
it
all
much
better
than
i
do
oh
well
i
used
to
come
here
a
lot
when
i
was
little
i
sort
of
lived
here
maisie
eyes
listened
utterly
attentive
you
knew
jerrold
then
when
he
was
little
too
yes
he
was
eight
when
i
was
five
do
you
remember
what
he
was
like
yes
maisie
waited
to
see
whether
anne
were
going
on
or
not
but
as
anne
stopped
dead
she
went
on
herself
i
wish
known
jerry
all
the
time
like
that
i
wish
i
remembered
running
about
and
playing
with
him
you
were
jerrold
friend
were
you
and
elliot
and
colin
the
lying
had
begun
falsehood
by
implication
and
to
this
creature
of
palpable
truth
somehow
i
always
thought
of
you
as
jerrold
most
that
what
makes
me
feel
as
if
you
were
mine
as
if
i
known
you
quite
a
long
time
you
see
he
told
me
things
about
you
has
he
anne
voice
was
as
dull
and
flat
as
she
could
make
it
if
only
maisie
would
leave
off
talking
about
jerrold
making
her
lie
i
wanted
to
know
you
more
than
anybody
i
ever
heard
of
there
are
heaps
of
things
i
want
to
say
to
you
she
stooped
to
pick
the
last
tulip
of
the
bunch
she
was
gathering
for
anne
i
think
it
was
perfectly
splendid
of
you
the
way
you
looked
after
colin
and
the
way
looked
after
jerry
land
for
him
that
was
nothing
i
was
very
glad
to
do
it
for
jerrold
but
it
was
my
job
anyway
well
you
saved
colin
and
you
saved
the
land
what
more
i
believe
you
saved
jerrold
how
do
you
mean
him
i
did
know
he
wanted
saving
he
did
rather
i
mean
you
made
him
care
about
the
estate
he
care
a
rap
about
it
till
he
came
down
here
this
last
time
you
found
his
job
for
him
he
have
found
it
himself
all
right
without
me
i
not
so
sure
we
were
awfully
worried
about
him
after
the
war
he
was
all
at
a
loose
end
without
anything
to
do
and
dreadfully
restless
we
thought
he
never
settle
to
anything
again
and
i
was
afraid
want
to
live
in
london
i
do
think
he
ever
do
that
he
wo
now
but
you
see
he
used
to
be
afraid
of
this
place
i
know
after
his
father
death
and
he
simply
loves
it
now
i
think
it
because
he
seen
what
done
with
it
i
know
he
had
the
smallest
idea
of
farming
it
before
it
what
he
ought
to
have
been
doing
all
his
life
and
when
you
think
how
seedy
he
was
when
he
came
down
here
and
how
fit
he
is
now
i
think
anne
said
i
better
be
going
maisie
innocence
was
more
than
she
could
bear
jerry
see
you
home
and
you
come
again
wo
you
soon
will
you
take
them
i
gathered
them
for
you
thanks
thanks
awfully
anne
voice
came
with
a
jerk
her
breath
choked
her
jerrold
was
coming
down
the
garden
walk
looking
for
her
she
said
to
maisie
and
turned
to
go
with
him
home
well
he
said
how
did
you
and
maisie
get
on
it
was
exactly
what
i
thought
it
would
be
only
worse
he
laughed
worse
i
mean
she
was
sweeter
jerrold
she
makes
me
feel
such
a
brute
such
an
awful
brute
and
if
she
ever
knows
she
wo
know
when
he
had
left
her
anne
flung
herself
down
on
the
couch
and
cried
all
evening
maisie
tulips
stood
up
in
the
chinese
bowl
on
the
table
they
had
childlike
innocent
faces
that
reproached
her
nothing
would
ever
be
the
same
again
xv
anne
jerrold
and
maisie
i
it
was
a
sunday
in
the
middle
of
april
jerrold
had
motored
up
to
london
on
the
friday
and
had
brought
eliot
back
with
him
for
the
anne
had
come
over
as
she
always
did
on
a
sunday
afternoon
she
and
maisie
were
sitting
out
on
the
terrace
when
eliot
came
to
them
walking
with
the
tired
limp
that
anne
found
piteous
and
adorable
very
soon
maisie
murmured
some
gentle
unintelligible
excuse
and
left
them
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
in
which
everything
they
had
ever
said
to
each
other
was
present
to
them
making
all
other
speech
unnecessary
as
if
they
held
a
long
intimate
conversation
eliot
sat
very
still
not
looking
at
her
yet
attentive
as
if
he
listened
to
the
passing
of
those
unuttered
words
then
anne
spoke
and
her
voice
broke
up
his
mood
what
are
you
doing
now
bacteriology
yes
we
found
the
thing
we
were
looking
for
the
germ
of
trench
fever
you
mean
have
well
somebody
would
have
spotted
it
if
i
had
a
lot
of
us
were
out
for
it
oh
eliot
i
am
so
glad
that
means
you
stamp
out
the
disease
does
it
probably
in
time
i
knew
you
do
it
i
knew
you
do
something
big
before
finished
my
dear
i
only
just
begun
but
there
nothing
big
about
it
but
the
research
and
we
were
all
in
that
all
looking
for
the
same
thing
happening
to
spot
it
is
just
heaven
own
luck
but
are
you
glad
it
was
you
it
does
matter
who
it
is
but
i
suppose
i
glad
it
the
sort
of
thing
i
wanted
to
do
and
it
rather
more
important
than
most
things
one
does
he
said
no
more
years
ago
when
he
had
done
nothing
he
had
talked
excitedly
and
arrogantly
about
his
work
now
that
he
had
done
what
he
had
set
out
to
do
he
was
reserved
impassive
and
very
humble
do
jerrold
and
colin
know
she
said
not
yet
you
the
first
dear
eliot
you
know
i
be
glad
it
nice
of
you
to
care
of
course
she
cared
she
was
glad
to
think
that
he
had
that
supreme
satisfaction
to
make
up
for
the
cruelty
of
her
refusal
to
care
more
perhaps
she
thought
he
would
have
had
it
if
he
had
had
her
he
would
have
been
torn
in
two
he
would
have
had
to
give
himself
twice
over
she
felt
that
he
did
love
her
more
than
he
loved
his
science
and
science
exacted
an
uninterrupted
and
undivided
service
one
life
had
room
enough
for
two
such
loves
and
he
might
not
have
done
so
much
if
she
had
been
there
calling
back
his
thoughts
drawing
his
passion
to
herself
what
are
you
going
to
do
next
she
said
next
i
going
off
for
a
month
holiday
to
sicily

but
that
no
good
to
jerrold
will
be
here
for
the
haying
if
you
thinking
of
that
i
not
thinking
of
that
i
thinking
of
colin
as
she
said
it
she
knew
that
she
was
lying
lying
to
maisie
lying
for
the
first
time
that
came
of
knowing
maisie
it
came
of
sweetness
she
would
have
to
lie
and
lie
she
was
not
thinking
of
colin
now
she
was
thinking
that
if
jerrold
came
back
for
the
hay
harvest
and
maisie
went
on
with
colin
to
the
italian
lakes
she
would
have
her
lover
to
herself
they
would
be
alone
together
all
june
she
would
lie
in
his
arms
not
for
their
short
reckless
hour
of
sunday
but
night
after
night
from
long
before
midnight
till
the
dawn
for
last
year
when
the
warm
weather
came
anne
and
colin
had
slept
out
of
doors
in
wooden
shelters
set
up
in
the
manor
fields
away
from
the
noises
of
the
farm
a
low
stone
wall
separated
anne
field
from
colin
this
year
when
jerrold
came
home
colin
shelter
had
been
moved
up
from
the
field
to
the
manor
garden
in
the
summer
anne
would
sleep
again
in
her
shelter
the
path
to
her
field
from
the
manor
garden
lay
through
three
pastures
and
two
strips
of
fir
plantation
with
a
green
drive
between
jerrold
would
come
to
her
there
he
would
have
his
bed
in
shelter
in
the
garden
and
when
the
night
was
quiet
he
would
get
up
and
go
down
the
manor
fields
and
through
the
fir
plantation
to
her
shelter
at
the
bottom
they
would
lie
there
in
each
other
arms
utterly
safe
hidden
from
passing
feet
and
listening
ears
and
eyes
that
watched
behind
window
panes
and
as
she
thought
of
his
coming
to
her
and
heard
her
own
voice
lying
to
maisie
the
blood
mounted
to
her
face
flooding
it
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
i
thinking
of
colin
her
voice
kept
on
sounding
loud
and
dreadful
in
her
brain
while
maisie
voice
floated
across
it
faint
as
if
it
came
from
somewhere
a
long
way
off
you
never
think
of
yourself
you
too
good
for
anything
anne
she
would
never
be
safe
from
maisie
and
maisie
innocence
that
accused
reproached
and
threatened
her
maisie
sweetness
went
through
her
like
a
thrusting
sword
like
a
sharp
poison
it
had
words
that
cut
deeper
than
threats
reproaches
accusations
before
she
had
seen
maisie
she
had
been
fearless
pitiless
remorseless
now
because
of
maisie
she
would
never
be
safe
from
remorse
and
pity
and
fear
she
recovered
she
told
herself
that
she
had
lied
that
she
been
thinking
of
colin
that
she
had
thought
of
him
first
that
she
had
refused
to
go
to
taormina
before
she
knew
that
jerrold
was
coming
back
for
the
hay
harvest
she
could
help
it
if
she
knew
that
now
it
was
not
as
if
she
had
schemed
for
it
or
counted
on
it
she
had
never
for
one
moment
counted
on
anything
or
schemed
and
still
as
she
thought
of
jerrold
her
heart
tightened
on
the
sharp
of
remorse
because
of
maisie
nothing
would
ever
be
the
same
again
ii
in
the
last
week
of
april
they
had
gone
jerrold
and
maisie
eliot
and
colin
to
taormina
in
the
last
week
in
may
jerrold
and
eliot
took
maisie
up
to
como
on
their
way
home
they
found
sir
charles
and
lady
durham
there
waiting
for
her
they
had
left
colin
by
himself
at
taormina
from
the
first
moment
of
landing
colin
had
fallen
in
love
with
sicily
and
refused
to
be
taken
away
from
it
he
was
aware
that
his
recovery
was
now
in
his
own
hands
and
that
he
would
not
be
free
from
his
malady
so
long
as
he
was
afraid
to
be
alone
he
had
got
to
break
himself
of
his
habit
of
dependence
on
other
people
and
here
in
taormina
he
had
come
upon
the
place
that
he
could
bear
to
be
alone
in
there
was
freedom
in
his
surrender
to
its
enchantment
and
in
the
contemplation
of
its
beauty
there
was
peace
and
with
peace
and
freedom
he
had
found
his
indestructible
self
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
its
long
injury
one
day
sitting
out
on
the
balcony
of
his
hotel
he
wrote
to
anne
do
imagine
because
i
got
well
here
away
from
you
that
it
you
who
made
me
well
in
the
first
place
i
should
never
have
gone
away
if
you
had
made
me
go
you
knew
what
you
were
about
when
you
sent
me
here
i
know
now
what
jerrold
meant
when
he
wanted
to
get
away
by
himself
after
father
died
he
said
he
wanted
to
grow
a
new
memory
well
that
what
i
done
here
it
seemed
to
happen
all
at
once
one
day
i
left
them
all
and
gone
out
for
a
walk
by
myself
it
came
over
me
that
between
me
and
being
well
perfectly
well
there
was
nothing
but
myself
that
i
was
really
hanging
on
to
my
illness
for
some
sort
of
protection
that
it
gave
me
just
as
i
hung
on
to
you
i
been
thinking
about
it
all
the
time
filling
my
mind
with
my
illness
hanging
on
to
the
very
fear
of
it
to
save
myself
i
suppose
from
a
worse
fear
the
fear
of
life
itself
and
suddenly
out
there
i
let
go
and
the
beauty
of
the
place
got
me
i
ca
describe
the
beauty
except
that
there
was
a
lot
of
strong
blue
and
yellow
in
it
a
clear
gold
atmosphere
positively
quivering
and
streaming
over
everything
like
gold
water
i
seemed
to
remember
it
as
if
i
been
here
before
a
long
steady
memory
not
just
a
flash
it
was
like
finding
something
you
lost
or
when
a
musical
phrase
you
been
looking
for
suddenly
comes
back
to
you
it
was
the
most
utter
indescribable
peace
and
satisfaction
and
somehow
this
time
joined
on
to
the
times
at
wyck
when
we
were
all
there
and
happy
together
and
the
beastly
time
in
between
slipped
through
it
just
dropped
out
as
if
it
had
never
happened
and
i
got
a
sense
of
having
done
with
it
forever
i
ca
tell
you
what
it
was
like
but
i
think
it
means
i
well
and
then
on
the
top
of
it
all
i
remembered
you
anne
and
all
your
goodness
and
sweetness
i
got
right
away
from
my
beastly
self
and
saw
you
as
you
are
and
i
knew
what
you
done
for
me
i
do
believe
i
ever
knew
really
before
i
had
to
be
alone
with
myself
before
i
could
see
it
just
as
i
always
had
to
be
alone
with
my
music
before
i
could
get
it
right
i
never
thanked
you
properly
i
ca
thank
you
there
are
any
words
to
do
it
in
and
i
only
know
now
what
it
cost
you
did
he
know
did
he
know
that
it
had
once
cost
her
jerrold
for
instance
i
know
you
gave
up
coming
here
with
us
because
you
thought
it
would
be
better
for
me
without
you
colin
too
turning
it
in
her
heart
the
sharp
blade
of
remorse
would
they
never
have
done
punishing
her
and
then
maisie
knows
what
you
are
she
told
eliot
you
were
the
most
beautiful
thing
morally
she
had
ever
known
the
one
person
she
said
whose
motives
would
always
be
clean
if
he
had
tried
he
could
have
hit
on
anything
that
would
have
hurt
her
so
it
was
more
than
she
could
bear
to
be
punished
like
this
through
the
innocence
of
innocent
people
through
their
kindness
and
affection
their
belief
their
incorruptible
trust
in
her
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
she
dreaded
more
than
maisie
trust
it
was
as
if
she
foresaw
what
it
would
do
to
her
how
at
any
minute
it
would
beat
her
it
would
break
her
down
but
she
was
not
beaten
yet
not
broken
down
after
every
fit
of
remorse
her
passion
asserted
itself
again
in
a
superb
recovery
her
motives
might
not
be
so
spotless
as
they
looked
to
maisie
but
her
passion
itself
was
clean
as
fire
nothing
not
even
maisie
innocence
trust
in
her
could
make
her
go
back
on
it
hard
wounding
tears
cut
through
her
eyelids
as
she
thought
of
maisie
but
she
brushed
them
away
and
began
counting
the
days
till
jerrold
should
come
back
iii
he
came
back
the
first
week
in
june
in
time
for
the
hay
harvest
and
it
happened
as
she
had
foreseen
it
would
have
been
dangerous
for
jerrold
to
have
left
the
house
at
night
to
go
to
the
manor
farm
at
any
moment
he
might
have
been
betrayed
by
his
own
footsteps
treading
the
passages
and
stairs
by
the
slipping
of
locks
and
bolts
the
sound
of
the
opening
and
shutting
of
doors
the
servants
might
be
awake
and
hear
him
they
might
go
to
his
room
and
find
that
he
was
not
there
but
colin
shelter
stood
in
a
recess
on
the
lawn
open
to
the
fields
and
hidden
from
the
house
by
tall
hedges
of
yew
nobody
could
see
him
slip
out
into
the
moonlight
or
the
darkness
nobody
could
hear
the
soft
padding
of
his
feet
on
the
grass
he
had
only
to
run
down
the
three
fields
and
cross
the
belt
of
firs
to
come
to
anne
shelter
at
the
bottom
the
blank
projecting
wall
of
the
mill
hid
it
from
the
cottages
and
the
manor
farm
house
the
firs
hid
it
from
the
field
path
a
high
bank
topped
by
a
stone
wall
hid
it
from
the
road
and
sutton
farm
its
three
wooden
walls
held
them
safe
night
after
night
between
eleven
and
midnight
he
came
to
her
night
after
night
she
lay
awake
waiting
till
the
light
rustling
of
the
meadow
grass
told
her
he
was
there
on
moonlit
nights
a
quick
brushing
sound
in
the
thick
blackness
a
sound
like
a
slow
shearing
as
he
felt
his
way
the
moon
would
show
him
clear
as
he
stood
in
the
open
frame
of
the
shelter
looking
in
at
her
or
she
would
see
him
grey
twilit
and
mysterious
or
looming
darker
than
dark
on
black
nights
without
moon
or
stars
they
loved
the
clear
nights
when
their
bodies
showed
to
each
other
white
under
the
white
moon
they
loved
the
dark
nights
that
brought
them
close
shutting
them
in
annihilating
every
sensation
but
that
of
his
tense
hard
muscles
pressing
down
of
her
body
crushed
and
yielding
tightening
and
slackening
in
surrender
of
their
brains
swimming
in
their
dark
ecstasy
they
loved
the
warmth
of
each
other
bodies
in
the
hot
windless
nights
they
loved
their
smooth
clean
coolness
washed
by
the
night
wind
nothing
not
even
the
sweet
haunting
ghost
of
maisie
came
between
they
would
fall
asleep
in
each
other
arms
and
lie
there
till
dawn
till
anne
woke
in
a
sudden
fright
always
she
had
this
fear
that
some
day
they
would
sleep
on
into
the
morning
when
the
farm
people
would
be
up
and
about
jerrold
lay
still
tired
out
with
satisfaction
sunk
under
all
the
floors
of
sleep
she
had
to
drag
him
up
with
kisses
first
and
light
stroking
then
with
a
strong
undoing
of
their
embrace
pushing
back
his
heavy
arms
that
fell
again
to
her
breast
as
she
parted
them
then
she
would
wrench
herself
loose
and
shake
him
by
the
shoulders
till
she
woke
him
he
woke
clean
with
no
ugly
turning
and
yawning
but
with
a
great
stretching
of
his
strong
body
and
a
short
sudden
laugh
the
laugh
he
had
for
danger
then
he
would
look
at
his
wrist
watch
and
show
it
her
laughing
again
as
she
saw
that
this
time
again
they
were
safe
and
they
would
lie
a
little
while
longer
looking
into
each
faces
for
the
sheer
joy
of
looking
reckless
with
impunity
and
he
would
start
up
suddenly
with
i
say
anne
i
must
clear
out
or
we
shall
be
caught
and
they
would
get
up
outside
the
world
looked
young
and
unknown
in
the
june
dawn
in
the
still
clear
air
where
green
leaves
and
green
grass
shone
with
a
strange
hard
lustre
like
fresh
paint
and
yet
unearthly
uncreated
fixed
in
their
own
space
and
time
and
she
would
go
with
him
her
naked
feet
shining
white
on
the
queer
bright
cold
green
of
the
grass
up
the
field
to
the
belt
of
firs
that
stood
up
strange
and
eternal
under
the
risen
sun
they
parted
there
holding
each
other
for
a
last
kiss
a
last
clinging
as
if
never
in
this
world
they
would
meet
again
dawn
after
dawn
they
belonged
to
the
dawn
and
the
dawn
light
the
dawn
was
their
day
they
knew
it
as
they
knew
no
other
time
and
anne
would
go
back
to
her
shelter
and
lie
there
and
live
through
their
passion
again
in
memory
till
she
fell
asleep
and
when
she
woke
she
would
find
the
sweet
sad
ghost
of
maisie
haunting
her
coming
between
her
and
the
memory
of
her
dark
ecstasy
maisie
utterly
innocent
utterly
good
trusting
her
sending
jerrold
back
to
her
because
she
trusted
her
only
to
think
of
maisie
gave
her
a
fearful
sense
of
insecurity
she
thought
if
i
loved
her
i
could
never
have
done
it
if
i
were
to
love
her
even
now
that
would
end
it
we
go
on
she
prayed
god
that
she
might
not
love
her
by
day
the
hard
work
of
the
farm
stopped
her
thinking
and
the
next
night
and
the
next
dawn
brought
back
her
safety
iv
the
hay
harvest
was
over
by
the
last
week
of
june
and
in
the
first
week
of
july
maisie
had
come
back
maisie
or
no
maisie
the
work
of
the
farm
had
to
go
on
and
anne
felt
more
than
ever
that
it
justified
her
when
the
day
of
reckoning
came
if
it
ever
did
come
let
her
be
judged
by
her
work
because
of
her
love
for
jerrold
here
was
this
big
estate
held
together
and
kept
going
because
of
his
love
for
her
here
was
jerrold
growing
into
a
perfect
farmer
and
a
perfect
landlord
because
of
her
he
had
found
the
one
thing
he
was
best
fitted
to
do
because
of
him
she
herself
was
valuable
anne
brought
to
her
work
on
the
land
a
thoroughness
that
aimed
continually
at
perfection
she
watched
the
starting
of
every
and
driller
as
it
broke
fresh
ground
to
see
that
machines
and
men
were
working
at
their
highest
pitch
of
efficiency
she
demanded
efficiency
and
on
the
whole
she
got
it
she
gave
it
by
a
sort
of
contagion
she
wrung
out
of
the
land
the
very
utmost
it
was
capable
of
yielding
she
saw
that
there
was
no
waste
of
straw
or
hay
of
grain
or
fertilizers
and
she
knew
how
to
take
risks
spending
big
sums
on
implements
and
stock
wherever
she
saw
a
good
chance
of
a
return
jerrold
learned
from
her
this
perfection
her
work
stood
clear
for
the
whole
countryside
to
see
nobody
could
say
she
had
not
done
well
by
the
land
when
she
first
took
on
the
manor
farm
it
had
stood
only
in
the
second
class
in
four
years
she
had
raised
it
to
the
first
it
was
now
one
of
the
best
cultivated
estates
in
the
county
and
famous
for
its
prize
stock
sir
john
corbett
of
underwoods
hawtrey
of
medlicote
and
major
markham
of
wyck
wold
owned
to
an
admiration
for
anne
management
her
morals
they
said
might
be
a
trifle
shady
but
her
farming
was
above
reproach
more
reluctantly
they
admitted
that
she
had
made
something
of
that
young
rotter
colin
even
while
they
supposed
that
he
had
been
sent
abroad
to
keep
him
out
of
anne
severn
way
they
also
supposed
that
as
soon
as
he
could
do
it
decently
jerrold
would
get
rid
of
anne
then
two
things
happened
in
july
maisie
fielding
came
back
and
was
seen
driving
about
the
country
with
anne
severn
and
in
the
same
month
old
sutton
died
and
the
barrow
farm
was
let
to
anne
thus
establishing
her
permanence
anne
had
refused
to
take
it
from
jerrold
as
his
gift
he
had
pressed
her
persistently
you
might
anne
it
the
only
thing
i
can
give
you
and
what
is
it
a
scrubby
two
hundred
acres
it
a
thundering
lot
of
land
jerrold
i
ca
take
it
you
must
it
is
enough
after
all
you
done
for
us
i
like
to
give
you
everything
i
got
wyck
manor
and
the
whole
blessed
estate
to
the
last
turnip
and
every
cow
and
pig
but
i
ca
do
that
and
you
used
to
say
you
wanted
the
barrow
farm
i
wanted
to
rent
it
jerry
darling
i
ca
let
you
give
it
me
why
not
i
think
it
simply
beastly
of
you
not
to
at
that
point
maisie
had
passed
through
the
room
with
her
flowers
and
he
had
called
to
her
to
help
him
what
are
you
two
quarrelling
about
she
said
why
i
want
to
give
her
the
barrow
farm
and
she
wo
let
me
of
course
i
wo
let
him
a
whole
farm
how
could
i
i
think
you
might
anne
it
would
please
him
no
end
she
thinks
jerrold
said
she
can
go
on
doing
things
for
us
but
we
must
do
anything
for
her
and
i
say
it
beastly
of
her
it
is
really
anne
darling
it
selfish
he
wants
to
give
it
you
so
awfully
he
wo
be
happy
if
you
wo
take
it
but
a
farm
a
whole
thumping
farm
it
a
big
house
and
two
hundred
acres
how
can
i
take
a
thing
like
that
you
could
yourself
if
you
were
me
maisie
little
white
fingers
flickered
over
the
blue
delphiniums
stacked
in
the
chinese
jar
her
eyes
were
smiling
at
anne
over
the
tops
of
the
tall
blue
spires
do
you
want
to
make
him
happy
she
said
not
that
way
if
it
the
only
way
she
passed
out
of
the
room
still
smiling
to
gather
more
flowers
they
looked
at
each
other
jerrold
i
ca
stand
it
when
she
says
things
like
that
no
more
can
i
but
you
know
she
really
does
want
you
to
take
that
farm
do
you
see
why
i
ca
take
it
from
it
because
lovers
i
should
have
thought
that
made
it
easier
it
makes
it
impossible
i
myself
to
you
i
ca
take
anything
besides
it
would
look
as
if
i
taken
it
for
that
that
an
appalling
idea
anne
it
is
but
it
what
everybody
think
they
wonder
what
on
earth
you
did
it
for
we
do
want
people
wondering
about
us
if
they
once
begin
wondering
they
end
by
finding
out
i
see
perhaps
you
right
i
sorry
it
sticks
out
of
us
enough
as
it
is
i
ca
think
how
maisie
see
it
but
she
never
will
she
never
believe
that
we
do
you
want
her
to
see
it
no
but
it
hurts
so
her
not
seeing
jerrold
i
believe
that
the
punishment
maisie
trusting
us
it
the
worst
thing
she
could
have
done
to
us
then
if
we
punished
we
quits
do
think
of
it
anne
darling
do
let
maisie
come
in
between
us
like
that
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
close
and
quick
so
that
no
thought
could
come
between
but
maisie
sweetness
had
not
done
its
worst
she
had
yet
to
prove
what
she
was
and
what
she
could
do
v
july
passed
and
august
the
harvest
was
over
and
in
september
jerrold
went
up
to
london
to
stay
with
eliot
for
the
and
anne
stayed
with
maisie
because
maisie
did
like
being
left
in
the
big
house
by
herself
through
all
those
weeks
that
was
the
way
maisie
had
her
through
her
need
of
her
and
on
the
thursday
before
anne
came
maisie
had
called
on
hawtrey
of
medlicote
and
hawtrey
had
asked
her
to
lunch
with
her
on
the
following
monday
maisie
said
she
was
afraid
she
could
lunch
on
monday
because
anne
severn
would
be
with
her
and
hawtrey
said
she
was
very
sorry
but
she
was
afraid
she
could
ask
anne
severn
and
maisie
enquired
in
her
tender
voice
why
not
and
hawtrey
replied
because
my
dear
nobody
here
does
ask
anne
severn
maisie
said
again
why
not
then
hawtrey
said
she
did
want
to
go
into
it
the
whole
thing
was
so
unpleasant
but
nobody
call
on
anne
severn
she
was
too
well
known
and
at
that
maisie
rose
in
her
fragile
dignity
and
said
that
nobody
knew
anne
severn
so
well
as
she
and
her
husband
did
and
that
there
was
nobody
in
the
world
so
absolutely
as
anne
and
that
she
possibly
know
anybody
who
refused
to
know
her
and
so
left
hawtrey
the
evening
jerrold
came
home
maisie
flushed
with
pleasure
entertained
him
with
a
report
of
the
encounter
so
you
given
an
ultimatum
to
the
county
yes
i
told
you
i
cut
them
all
if
they
went
on
cutting
anne
and
now
they
know
it
that
means
that
you
wo
know
anybody
maisie
except
for
anne
and
me
you
be
absolutely
alone
here
i
do
care
i
do
want
anybody
but
you
and
anne
and
if
i
do
we
can
ask
somebody
down
there
are
lots
of
amusing
people
who
come
and
eliot
can
bring
his
scientific
crowd
it
simply
means
that
corbetts
and
hawtreys
wo
be
asked
to
meet
them
that
all
she
went
upstairs
to
lie
down
before
dinner
and
presently
anne
came
to
him
in
the
she
was
dressed
in
her
riding
coat
and
breeches
as
she
had
come
off
the
land
what
do
you
think
maisie
done
now
he
said
i
do
know
something
that
make
me
feel
awful
i
suppose
if
you
going
to
take
it
like
that
i
wo
tell
you
yes
tell
me
tell
me
i
rather
know
he
told
her
as
maisie
had
told
him
ca
you
see
her
standing
up
to
the
whole
county
pounding
them
with
her
little
hands
his
vision
of
the
gentle
thing
rising
up
in
that
sudden
sacred
fury
of
protection
moved
him
to
admiring
tender
laughter
it
made
anne
burst
into
tears
oh
jerrold
that
the
worst
that
happened
yet
everybody
cut
her
because
of
me
bless
you
she
wo
care
she
says
she
does
care
about
anybody
but
you
and
me
but
that
the
awful
thing
her
caring
that
the
punishment
the
punishment
again
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
comforted
her
what
am
i
to
do
jerry
what
am
i
to
go
to
her
he
said
and
say
something
nice
go
to
her
and
take
my
punishment
well
yes
darling
i
afraid
you
got
to
take
it
we
ca
have
it
both
ways
it
would
a
punishment
if
you
were
so
sweet
if
you
did
mind
so
i
wish
to
god
i
never
told
you
she
held
her
head
high
i
made
you
i
glad
you
told
me
she
went
up
to
maisie
in
her
room
maisie
had
dressed
for
dinner
and
lay
on
her
couch
looking
exquisite
and
fragile
in
a
gown
of
thick
white
lace
she
gave
a
little
soft
cry
as
anne
came
to
her
anne
you
been
crying
what
is
it
darling
nothing
only
jerrold
told
me
what
you
done
done
yes
for
me
why
did
you
do
it
maisie
why
i
suppose
it
was
because
i
love
you
it
was
the
least
i
could
do
she
held
out
her
hands
to
her
anne
knelt
down
crouching
on
the
floor
beside
her
with
her
face
hidden
against
maisie
body
maisie
put
her
arm
round
her
but
why
are
you
crying
about
it
anne
you
never
cry
i
ca
bear
it
it
like
seeing
jerrold
cry
it
because
you
so
good
so
good
and
i
such
a
brute
you
know
what
a
brute
i
am
oh
yes
i
know
do
you
she
said
sharply
for
one
moment
she
thought
that
maisie
did
indeed
know
know
and
understand
so
perfectly
that
she
forgave
this
was
forgiveness
of
course
i
do
and
so
does
jerrold
knows
what
a
brute
you
are
it
was
not
forgiveness
it
was
maisie
innocence
again
her
trust
the
punishment
anne
knelt
there
and
took
the
pain
of
it
vi
she
lay
awake
alone
in
her
shelter
she
had
given
the
excuse
of
a
racking
headache
to
keep
jerrold
from
coming
to
her
for
that
she
had
had
to
lie
but
what
was
her
whole
existence
but
a
lie
a
lie
told
by
her
silence
under
maisie
trust
in
her
by
her
acceptance
of
friendship
by
her
acquiescence
in
maisie
preposterous
belief
every
minute
that
she
let
maisie
go
on
loving
and
trusting
and
believing
in
her
she
lied
and
the
appalling
thing
was
that
she
could
be
alone
in
her
lying
so
long
as
maisie
trusted
him
jerrold
lied
too
jerrold
who
was
truth
itself
one
moment
she
thought
that
what
i
brought
him
to
that
how
i
dragged
him
down
the
next
she
saw
that
reproach
as
the
very
madness
of
her
conscience
she
had
not
dragged
jerrold
down
she
had
raised
him
to
his
highest
intensity
of
loving
she
had
brought
him
out
of
the
illusion
of
his
life
with
maisie
to
reality
and
kept
him
there
in
an
immaculate
faithfulness
not
even
for
one
insane
moment
did
anne
admit
that
there
was
anything
wrong
or
shameful
in
their
passion
itself
it
was
maisie
innocence
that
made
them
liars
goodness
that
put
them
in
the
wrong
and
brought
shame
on
them
her
truth
that
falsified
them
no
woman
less
exquisite
in
goodness
could
have
moved
her
to
this
incredible
remorse
it
took
the
whole
of
maisie
in
her
unique
perfection
to
beat
her
and
break
her
down
her
first
instinct
in
refusing
to
know
maisie
had
been
profoundly
right
it
was
as
if
she
had
foreseen
even
then
that
knowing
maisie
would
mean
loving
her
and
that
loving
her
she
would
be
beaten
and
broken
down
the
awful
thing
was
that
she
did
love
maisie
and
she
could
tell
which
was
the
worse
to
bear
her
love
for
maisie
or
maisie
love
for
her
and
who
could
have
foreseen
the
pain
of
it
when
she
prayed
that
she
might
take
the
whole
punishment
she
had
not
reckoned
on
this
refinement
and
precision
of
torture
god
knew
what
he
was
about
with
all
his
resources
he
could
have
hit
on
anything
more
delicately
calculated
to
hurt
nothing
less
subtle
would
have
touched
her
not
discovery
not
the
grossness
of
exposure
but
this
intolerable
security
what
could
discovery
and
exposure
do
but
set
her
free
in
her
reality
anne
would
have
rejoiced
to
see
her
lie
go
up
in
one
purifying
flame
of
revelation
but
to
go
safe
in
her
lie
hiding
her
reality
and
yet
defenceless
under
the
sting
of
maisie
loving
was
more
than
she
could
bear
she
had
brought
all
her
truth
and
all
her
fineness
to
this
passion
which
maisie
innocence
made
a
sin
and
she
was
punished
where
she
had
sinned
wounded
by
the
subtle
god
in
her
fineness
and
her
truth
if
only
jerrold
could
have
escaped
but
he
was
vulnerable
too
there
was
fineness
and
truth
in
him
to
suffer
really
he
had
to
be
wounded
in
his
soul
if
jerrold
was
hurt
then
they
must
end
it
as
yet
he
had
given
no
sign
of
feeling
but
that
was
like
him
up
to
the
last
minute
he
would
fight
against
feeling
and
when
it
came
he
would
refuse
to
own
that
he
suffered
that
there
was
any
cause
for
suffering
it
would
be
like
the
time
when
his
father
was
dying
when
he
refused
to
see
that
he
was
dying
so
he
would
refuse
to
see
maisie
and
then
all
at
once
he
would
see
her
and
he
would
be
beaten
and
broken
down
vii
and
suddenly
he
did
see
her
it
was
on
the
first
sunday
after
jerrold
return
maisie
had
had
another
of
her
heart
attacks
by
herself
in
her
bed
the
night
before
and
she
had
been
lying
down
all
day
the
sun
had
come
round
on
to
the
terrace
and
she
now
rested
there
wrapped
in
a
fur
coat
and
leaning
back
on
her
cushions
in
the
garden
chair
they
were
sitting
out
there
all
three
jerrold
and
anne
talking
together
and
maisie
listening
with
her
sweet
attentive
eyes
suddenly
she
shut
her
eyes
and
ceased
to
listen
jerrold
and
anne
went
on
talking
with
hushed
voices
and
in
a
little
while
maisie
was
asleep
her
head
rising
out
of
the
brown
fur
was
tilted
back
on
the
cushions
showing
her
innocent
white
throat
her
white
violet
eyelids
were
shut
down
on
her
eyes
the
dark
lashes
lying
still
her
mouth
utterly
innocent
was
half
open
her
breath
came
through
it
unevenly
in
light
jerks
she
asleep
jerrold
they
sat
still
making
no
sound
and
as
she
looked
at
maisie
sleeping
tears
came
again
into
anne
eyes
the
hard
tears
that
cut
her
eyelids
and
spilled
themselves
drop
by
slow
drop
heavily
she
tried
to
wipe
them
away
secretly
with
her
hand
before
jerrold
saw
them
but
they
came
again
and
again
and
he
had
seen
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
as
if
he
would
go
then
checked
himself
and
stood
beside
her
and
together
they
looked
on
at
maisie
sleeping
they
felt
together
the
infinite
anguish
the
infinite
pathos
of
her
goodness
and
her
trust
the
beauty
of
her
spirit
lay
bare
to
them
in
the
white
tilted
face
slackened
and
smoothed
with
sleep
sleep
showed
them
her
innocence
again
naked
and
helpless
they
saw
her
in
her
poignant
being
her
intense
reality
she
was
so
real
that
in
that
moment
nothing
else
mattered
to
them
anne
set
her
teeth
hard
to
keep
her
mouth
still
she
saw
jerrold
glance
at
her
she
heard
him
give
a
soft
groan
of
pity
or
of
pain
then
he
moved
away
from
them
and
stood
by
the
terrace
wall
with
his
back
to
her
she
saw
his
clenched
hands
and
through
his
terrible
tense
quietness
she
knew
by
the
quivering
of
his
shoulders
that
his
breast
heaved
then
she
saw
him
grasp
the
terrace
wall
and
grind
the
edge
of
it
into
the
palms
of
his
hands
that
was
how
he
had
stood
by
his
father
deathbed
gripping
the
and
when
presently
he
turned
and
came
to
her
she
saw
the
look
on
his
face
she
had
seen
then
of
young
blind
agony
sharpened
now
with
some
more
piercing
spiritual
pain
come
he
said
come
into
the
house
they
went
together
side
by
side
as
they
had
gone
when
they
were
children
along
the
terrace
and
down
the
steps
into
the
drive
in
the
shelter
of
the
hall
she
gave
way
and
cried
openly
and
helplessly
like
a
child
and
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
led
her
into
the
library
away
from
the
place
where
maisie
was
they
sat
together
on
the
couch
holding
each
other
hands
clinging
together
in
their
suffering
their
memory
of
what
maisie
had
made
their
sin
even
so
they
had
sat
in
anne
room
on
the
edge
of
anne
bed
when
they
were
children
holding
each
hands
miserable
and
yet
glad
because
they
were
brought
together
because
what
they
had
done
and
what
they
had
borne
they
had
done
and
borne
together
and
now
as
then
he
comforted
her
do
cry
anne
darling
it
is
your
fault
i
made
you
you
did
you
did
i
wanted
you
and
i
made
you
come
to
me
and
i
knew
what
it
would
be
like
and
you
did
nobody
could
have
known
do
go
back
on
it
i
not
going
back
on
it
if
only
i
never
seen
maisie
then
i
would
have
cared
we
could
have
gone
on
do
you
mean
we
ca
now
yes
how
can
we
when
she
such
an
angel
to
us
and
trusts
us
so
it
does
make
it
pretty
beastly
he
said
it
makes
me
feel
absolutely
rotten
so
it
does
me
when
i
think
about
it
it
knowing
her
jerry
it
having
to
love
her
and
knowing
that
she
loves
me
it
knowing
what
she
is
why
did
you
make
me
see
her
you
know
why
yes
because
it
made
it
safer
that
the
beastliness
of
it
i
knew
how
it
would
be
i
knew
she
beat
us
in
the
end
with
her
goodness
darling
it
your
fault
it
it
all
my
fault
i
not
going
back
on
it
i
do
it
again
if
it
were
for
maisie
even
now
i
do
know
whether
right
or
wrong
i
only
know
it
the
most
real
and
valuable
part
of
me
that
loves
you
and
it
the
most
real
and
valuable
part
of
you
that
loves
me
and
i
feel
somehow
that
that
makes
it
right
i
go
on
with
it
if
it
made
you
happy
but
you
are
happy
now
i
not
happy
because
you
not
i
do
mind
for
myself
so
much
only
i
hate
the
beastly
way
we
got
to
do
it
covering
it
all
up
and
pretending
that
we
not
lovers
deceiving
her
that
what
makes
it
all
wrong
hiding
it
i
know
and
i
made
you
do
that
you
did
we
did
it
for
maisie
anyhow
we
must
stop
it
we
ca
go
on
like
this
any
more
we
must
simply
tell
her
her
yes
tell
her
and
get
her
to
divorce
me
so
that
i
can
marry
you
the
only
straight
thing
how
can
we
it
would
hurt
her
so
awfully
not
so
much
as
you
think
remember
she
does
care
for
me
she
not
like
you
anne
she
frightfully
cold
as
he
said
it
there
came
to
her
a
sudden
awful
intimation
of
reality
a
sense
that
behind
all
their
words
all
the
protection
of
their
outward
thinking
there
hid
an
unknown
certainty
a
certainty
that
would
wreck
them
if
they
knew
it
it
was
safer
not
to
know
to
go
on
hiding
behind
those
barriers
of
thought
but
an
inward
ultimate
honesty
drove
her
to
her
questioning
are
you
sure
she
cold
absolutely
sure
you
go
on
thinking
all
the
time
that
she
like
you
that
she
takes
things
as
hard
as
you
do
but
she
does
she
feel
as
you
do
it
wo
hurt
her
as
it
would
hurt
you
if
i
left
you
for
somebody
else
but
it
hurt
her
it
better
to
hurt
her
a
little
now
than
to
go
on
humbugging
and
shamming
till
she
finds
out
that
would
hurt
her
damnably
she
hate
our
not
being
straight
with
her
but
if
we
tell
her
the
truth
understand
i
certain
she
understand
and
she
forgive
she
ca
be
hard
on
you
for
caring
for
me
even
if
she
does
care
she
cares
for
he
said
she
could
push
it
from
her
that
importunate
sense
of
a
certainty
that
was
not
his
certainty
if
maisie
did
care
for
him
jerrold
see
it
he
never
saw
what
he
did
want
to
see
supposing
she
care
all
the
time
how
do
you
know
she
does
i
do
think
i
can
tell
you
but
i
know
jerrold
it
makes
all
the
difference
it
makes
none
to
me
anne
i
want
you
whether
maisie
cared
for
me
or
not
but
she
does
if
i
thought
she
did
then
then
i
should
mind
her
knowing
why
are
you
so
certain
you
might
tell
me
then
he
told
her
after
all
that
sense
of
hidden
certainty
was
an
illusion
when
was
that
jerrold
oh
a
night
or
two
after
she
came
down
here
in
april
she
did
know
poor
darling
how
she
let
me
off
april
september
and
she
stuck
to
it
oh
stuck
to
it
rather
and
before
that
before
that
we
were
all
right
and
she
been
away
too
yes
ages
that
made
it
all
the
funnier
i
wish
you
told
me
before
i
wish
i
had
if
it
makes
you
happier
it
does
still
we
ca
go
on
jerrold
till
she
knows
of
course
we
ca
it
too
awful
i
tell
her
and
we
go
away
somewhere
while
she
divorcing
me
and
stay
away
till
i
can
marry
you
it
be
all
different
when
we
got
away
when
you
told
her
we
ought
to
have
told
her
long
ago
before
it
happened
yes
but
now
what
the
devil
i
to
tell
her
he
saw
as
if
for
the
first
time
what
telling
her
would
mean
tell
her
the
truth
the
whole
truth
how
can
i
when
it
it
because
it
me
that
you
got
to
tell
her
if
you
do
jerrold
i
tell
her
myself
all
right
i
tell
her
at
once
and
get
it
over
i
tell
her
tonight
no
not
tonight
while
she
so
tired
wait
till
she
rested
and
jerrold
waited
xvi
anne
maisie
and
jerrold
i
jerrold
waited
and
maisie
got
her
truth
in
first
it
was
on
the
wednesday
a
fine
bright
day
in
september
and
jerrold
was
to
have
driven
maisie
and
anne
over
to
oxford
in
the
car
and
ten
minutes
before
starting
maisie
had
declared
herself
too
tired
to
go
anne
would
go
without
her
and
jerrold
rather
sulky
had
set
off
by
himself
he
could
understand
maisie
sudden
fits
of
fatigue
when
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
her
he
thought
her
capricious
and
hysterical
she
was
acquiring
his
mother
perverse
habit
of
upsetting
your
engagements
at
the
last
moment
and
lately
she
had
been
particularly
tiresome
about
motoring
either
they
were
going
too
fast
or
too
far
or
the
wind
was
too
strong
and
he
would
have
to
turn
back
or
hold
himself
in
and
go
slowly
and
the
next
time
she
would
refuse
to
go
at
all
for
fear
of
spoiling
their
pleasure
she
liked
it
better
when
anne
drove
her
and
today
jerrold
was
annoyed
with
maisie
because
of
anne
if
it
been
for
maisie
anne
would
have
been
with
him
enjoying
a
day
holiday
for
once
really
maisie
might
have
thought
of
anne
and
anne
pleasure
it
was
like
her
not
to
think
of
other
people
yet
he
owned
that
she
had
wanted
anne
to
stay
with
her
he
could
hear
her
pathetic
voice
imploring
anne
to
go
because
jerry
wo
like
it
if
you
do
also
he
knew
that
if
anne
was
determined
not
to
do
a
thing
nothing
you
could
say
would
make
her
do
it
he
had
had
time
to
think
about
it
as
he
sat
in
the
lounge
of
the
hotel
at
oxford
waiting
for
the
friends
who
were
to
lunch
with
him
and
suddenly
his
annoyance
had
turned
to
pity
it
was
no
wonder
if
maisie
was
hysterical
his
life
with
her
was
all
wrong
all
horribly
unnatural
she
ought
to
have
had
children
or
he
ought
never
to
have
married
her
it
had
been
all
wrong
from
the
beginning
perhaps
she
had
been
aware
that
there
was
something
missing
perhaps
not
maisie
had
seemed
always
singularly
unaware
that
was
because
she
did
care
for
him
perhaps
if
he
had
loved
her
passionately
she
would
have
cared
more
perhaps
not
maisie
was
incurably
cold
she
shrank
from
the
slightest
gesture
of
approach
she
was
afraid
of
any
emotion
she
was
one
of
those
unhappy
women
who
are
born
with
an
aversion
from
warm
contacts
who
can
not
give
themselves
what
puzzled
him
was
the
union
of
such
a
temperament
with
sweetness
and
her
charm
he
had
noticed
that
other
men
adored
her
he
knew
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
anne
he
might
have
adored
her
too
and
again
he
wondered
whether
it
would
have
made
any
difference
to
maisie
if
he
had
he
thought
not
she
was
happy
as
it
was
in
her
gentle
unexcited
way
happy
and
at
peace
giving
happiness
and
peace
if
peace
were
what
you
wanted
it
was
that
happiness
and
peace
of
maisie
that
had
drawn
him
to
her
when
he
gave
anne
up
three
years
ago
and
again
he
could
understand
this
combination
of
hysteria
and
perfect
peace
he
could
understand
maisie
perhaps
after
all
she
had
got
what
she
had
wanted
she
would
have
been
happy
and
at
peace
if
she
had
been
married
to
some
brute
who
would
have
had
no
pity
who
would
have
insisted
on
his
rights
some
faithful
brute
or
some
brute
no
more
faithful
to
her
than
he
who
had
been
faithful
only
to
anne
as
he
thought
of
anne
darkness
came
down
over
his
brain
his
mind
struggled
through
it
looking
for
the
light
the
entrance
of
his
friends
cut
short
his
struggling
ii
maisie
lay
on
the
couch
in
the
library
and
anne
sat
with
her
eyes
had
been
closed
but
now
they
had
opened
and
anne
saw
them
looking
at
her
and
smiling
you
are
a
darling
anne
but
i
wish
you
gone
with
jerrold
i
do
i
would
have
liked
it
a
bit
would
though
not
when
he
thought
of
you
left
here
all
by
yourself
maisie
smiled
again
jerry
does
think
thank
goodness
why
goodness
because
i
do
want
him
to
i
do
want
him
to
see
to
see
what
why
that
i
ca
do
things
like
other
people
maisie
ca
you
you
used
to
jerrold
told
me
how
you
used
to
rush
about
dancing
and
golfing
and
playing
tennis
why
did
he
say
anything
only
that
you
took
a
lot
of
exercise
and
he
thinks
it
awfully
bad
for
you
knocking
it
all
off
now
dear
old
jerry
of
course
he
must
think
it
frightfully
stupid
but
i
ca
help
it
anne

ca
do
things
now
like
i
used
to
i
got
to
be
careful
but
why
because

wrong
with
my
heart
jerry
does
know
it
i
do
want
him
to
know
you
do
mean
seriously
wrong
not
very
serious
but
it
hurts
hurts
yes
and
the
pain
frightens
me
every
time
it
comes
i
think
i
going
to
die
but
i
do
die
oh
what
sort
of
pain

disgusting
pain
anne
as
if
it
was
full
of
splintered
glass
mixed
up
with
bubbling
blood
cutting
and
tearing
it
grabs
at
you
and
you
choke
you
feel
as
if
your
face
would
burst
you
afraid
to
breathe
for
fear
it
should
come
again
but
maisie
that
angina
it
is
real
angina

feel
i
afraid
of
everything
that
makes
me
feel
i
afraid
of
jerrold
touching
me
even
of
his
saying
something
nice
to
me
the
least
thing
makes
my
silly
heart
tumble
about
and
if
it
tumbles
too
much
the
pain
comes
i
dare
let
jerrold
sleep
with
me
yet
you
have
told
him
no
i
dare
you
tell
him
maisie
i
wo
he
mind
horribly
he
be
frightened
and
miserable
and
i
ca
bear
him
to
be
frightened
and
miserable
he
had
enough
been
through
the
war
i
do
mean
that
that
frightened
him
but
this
would
do
you
mean
to
say
he
does
see
it
bless
you
no
he
just
thinks
i
tiresome
and
hysterical
i
rather
he
thought
that
than
see
him
unhappy
nothing
in
the
world
matters
but
jerrold
you
see
i
care
for
him
so
frightfully
you
do
know
how
awful
it
is
caring
like
that
and
yet
having
to
beat
him
back
all
the
time
never
to
give
him
anything
i
dare
let
him
come
near
me
because
of
that
ghastly
fright
i
know
you
ought
to
be
afraid
of
pain
but
it
a
pain
that
makes
you
afraid
being
afraid
all
part
of
it
so
i
ca
help
it
of
course
you
ca
help
it
i
would
mind
if
it
was
for
jerry
i
ought
never
to
have
married
him
but
maisie
i
ca
understand
it
you
always
so
happy
and
calm
how
can
you
be
calm
and
happy
with
hanging
over
you
i
got
to
be
calm
for
fear
of
it
and
i
happy
because
there
simply
knowing
that
he
there
i
ca
think
what
i
do
anne
if
he
was
such
an
angel
some
men
would
be
they
stand
it
and
that
makes
me
care
all
the
more
he
never
know
how
i
care
you
must
tell
him
there
it
is
i
dare
even
try
to
tell
him
i
just
live
in
perpetual
funk
and
you
the
bravest
thing
that
ever
lived
oh
i
got
to
cover
it
up
it
would
do
to
show
it
but
i
glad
i
told
you
she
leaned
back
panting
i
must
talk
any
more
now
no
rest
you
wo
mind
but
get
a
book
and
read
you
be
so
bored
she
shut
her
eyes
anne
got
a
book
and
tried
to
read
it
but
the
words
ran
together
grey
lines
tangled
on
a
white
page
nothing
was
clear
to
her
but
the
fact
that
maisie
had
told
the
truth
about
herself
it
was
the
worst
thing
that
had
happened
yet
it
was
the
supreme
reproach
the
ultimate
disaster
and
defeat
yet
maisie
had
not
told
her
anything
that
surprised
her
this
was
the
certainty
that
hid
behind
the
defences
of
their
thought
the
certainty
she
had
foreseen
when
jerrold
told
her
about
maisie
coldness
it
meant
that
jerrold
could
escape
and
that
his
punishment
would
be
even
worse
than
hers
nothing
that
maisie
could
have
done
would
have
been
more
terrible
to
jerrold
than
her
illness
and
the
way
she
had
hidden
it
from
him
the
poor
darling
going
in
terror
of
it
lying
in
bed
alone
night
after
night
shut
in
with
her
terror
jerrold
was
utterly
vulnerable
his
belief
in
indifference
had
been
his
only
protection
against
remorse
how
was
he
going
to
bear
maisie
wounding
love
how
would
he
take
the
knowledge
of
it
anne
saw
what
must
come
of
his
knowing
it
would
be
the
end
of
their
happiness
after
this
they
would
have
to
give
each
other
up
he
would
never
take
her
in
his
arms
again
he
would
never
come
to
her
again
in
the
fields
between
midnight
and
dawn
they
could
go
on
unless
they
told
maisie
the
truth
and
they
could
tell
maisie
the
truth
now
because
the
truth
would
bring
the
pain
back
to
her
poor
little
heart
they
could
never
be
straight
with
her
they
would
have
to
hide
what
they
had
done
for
ever
maisie
had
silenced
them
for
ever
when
she
got
her
truth
in
first
to
anne
it
was
not
thinkable
either
that
they
should
go
on
being
lovers
knowing
about
maisie
or
that
she
should
keep
her
knowledge
to
herself
she
would
tell
jerrold
and
end
it
iii
she
stayed
on
with
maisie
till
the
evening
jerrold
had
come
back
and
was
walking
home
with
her
through
the
manor
fields
when
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
tell
him
now
at
the
next
gate
the
next
when
they
came
to
the
belt
of
firs
she
would
tell
him
she
stopped
him
there
by
the
fence
of
the
plantation
the
darkness
hid
them
from
each
other
only
their
faces
and
anne
white
coat
glimmered
through
wait
a
minute
jerrold
i
want
to
tell
you
something
about
maisie
he
drew
himself
up
abruptly
and
she
felt
the
sudden
start
and
check
of
his
hurt
mind
you
have
told
her
he
said
no
it
something
she
told
me
she
does
want
you
to
know
but
you
got
to
know
it
you
think
she
does
care
for
you
and
she
does
she
cares
awfully
but
she
ill
she
is
anne
she
only
thinks
she
is
i
know
maisie
you
do
know
that
she
gets
heart
attacks
frightful
pain
jerrold
pain
that
terrifies
her
my
god
you
do
mean
she
got
not
the
real
kind
if
it
was
that
she
be
dead
but
pain
so
bad
that
she
thinks
she
dying
every
time
it
what
they
call
false
angina
that
why
she
does
want
you
to
sleep
with
her
for
fear
it
come
on
and
you
see
her
through
the
darkness
she
could
feel
the
vibration
of
his
shock
it
came
to
her
in
his
stillness
you
said
she
did
feel
she
afraid
to
feel
because
feeling
brings
it
on
he
spoke
at
last
why
on
earth
could
she
tell
me
that
because
she
loves
you
so
awfully
the
poor
darling
did
want
you
to
be
unhappy
about
her
as
if
that
mattered
it
matters
more
than
anything
to
her
do
you
really
mean
that
she
got
that
hellish
thing
who
told
her
what
it
was
some
london
doctor
and
a
man
at
torquay
i
shall
take
her
up
and
make
her
see
a
specialist
if
you
do
you
must
let
her
know
i
told
you
or
she
never
tell
me
anything
again
what
am
i
to
say
say
you
been
worried
about
her
god
knows
i
ought
to
have
been
you
worried
about
her
and
you
think
there
something
wrong
if
she
says
there
is
you
say
that
what
you
want
to
be
sure
of
look
here
how
do
those
fellows
know
it
is
the
real
thing
oh
they
can
tell
that
by
the
state
of
her
heart
i
do
suppose
for
a
moment
it
the
real
thing
she
would
be
alive
if
it
was
and
you
do
die
of
false
angina
it
all
nerves
though
it
hurts
like
sin
he
was
silent
for
a
second
anne
she
beaten
us
we
ca
tell
her
now
no
and
we
ca
go
on
if
we
ca
be
straight
about
it
we
got
to
give
each
other
up
i
know
we
ca
go
on
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
his
voice
dropped
on
her
aching
heart
with
the
toneless
weight
of
finality
we
got
to
end
it
now
this
minute
she
said
do
come
any
farther
let
me
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
field
no
i
not
going
that
way
he
had
come
close
to
her
now
close
as
though
he
would
have
taken
her
in
his
arms
for
the
last
night
the
last
time
he
wanted
to
touch
her
to
hold
her
back
from
the
swallowing
darkness
but
she
moved
out
of
his
reach
and
he
did
not
follow
her
his
passion
was
ready
to
flame
up
if
he
touched
her
and
he
was
afraid
they
must
end
it
clean
without
a
word
or
a
touch
the
grass
drive
between
the
firs
led
to
a
gate
on
the
hill
road
that
skirted
the
manor
fields
he
knew
that
she
would
go
from
him
that
way
because
she
did
want
to
pass
by
their
shelter
at
the
bottom
she
could
sleep
in
it
tonight
he
stood
still
and
watched
her
go
her
white
coat
glimmering
in
the
darkness
between
the
black
rows
of
firs
the
white
gate
glimmered
at
the
end
of
the
drive
she
stood
there
a
moment
he
saw
her
slip
like
a
white
ghost
between
the
gate
and
the
gate
post
he
heard
the
light
thud
of
the
wooden
latch
falling
back
behind
her
and
she
was
gone
xvii
jerrold
maisie
anne
eliot
i
maisie
lay
in
bed
helpless
and
abandoned
to
her
illness
it
was
no
good
trying
to
cover
it
up
and
hide
it
any
more
jerrold
knew
the
night
when
he
left
anne
he
had
gone
up
to
maisie
in
her
room
he
could
rest
unless
he
knew
that
she
was
all
right
he
had
stooped
over
her
to
kiss
her
and
she
had
sat
up
holding
her
face
to
him
her
hands
clasped
round
his
neck
drawing
him
close
to
her
when
suddenly
the
pain
gripped
her
and
she
lay
back
in
his
arms
choking
struggling
for
breath
jerrold
thought
she
was
dying
he
waited
till
the
pain
passed
and
she
was
quieted
then
he
ran
downstairs
and
telephoned
for
ransome
he
looked
on
in
agony
while
ransome
stethoscope
wandered
over
thin
breast
and
back
it
seemed
to
him
that
ransome
was
taking
an
unusually
long
time
about
it
that
he
must
be
on
the
track
of
some
terrible
discovery
and
when
ransome
took
the
tubes
from
his
ears
and
said
curtly
heart
quite
sound
nothing
wrong
there
he
was
convinced
that
ransome
was
an
old
fool
who
did
know
his
business
or
else
he
was
lying
for
maisie
sake
downstairs
in
the
library
he
turned
on
him
look
here
there
no
good
lying
to
me
i
want
truth
my
dear
fielding
i
should
dream
of
lying
to
you
there
nothing
wrong
with
your
wife
heart
nothing
organically
wrong
with
that
pain
she
was
in
agony
ransome
agony
why
ca
you
tell
me
at
once
that
it
angina
because
it
is
not
the
real
thing
false
angina
a
neurosis
not
a
heart
disease
get
the
nervous
condition
cured
and
she
be
all
right
has
she
had
any
worry
any
shock
not
that
i
know
any
cause
for
worry
he
hesitated
poor
maisie
had
had
cause
enough
if
she
had
known
but
she
did
know
it
seemed
to
him
that
ransome
was
looking
at
him
queerly
no
he
said
none
you
quite
certain
has
she
ever
had
any
well
i
suppose
she
was
pretty
jumpy
all
the
time
i
was
at
the
front
before
that
years
ago
that
i
do
know
i
should
say
not
you
wo
swear
no
i
wo
swear
it
would
be
years
before
we
were
married
try
and
find
out
said
ransome
and
keep
her
quiet
and
happy
better
stay
in
bed
for
a
week
or
two
so
maisie
stayed
in
bed
and
jerrold
and
anne
sat
with
her
together
or
in
turn
he
had
a
bed
made
up
in
her
room
and
slept
there
when
he
slept
at
all
but
half
the
night
he
lay
awake
listening
for
the
sound
of
her
panting
and
the
little
gasping
cry
that
would
come
when
the
pain
got
her
he
kept
on
getting
up
to
look
at
her
and
make
sure
that
she
was
sleeping
he
was
changed
from
his
old
happy
careless
self
the
self
that
used
to
turn
from
any
trouble
that
refused
to
believe
that
the
people
it
loved
could
be
ill
and
die
he
was
convinced
that
maisie
state
was
dangerous
he
sent
for
harper
of
cheltenham
and
for
a
nerve
specialist
and
a
heart
specialist
from
london
and
they
all
told
him
the
same
thing
and
he
would
believe
them
because
maisie
death
was
the
most
unbearable
thing
that
his
remorse
could
imagine
he
felt
that
nothing
short
of
maisie
death
would
appease
the
powers
that
punished
him
he
was
the
more
certain
that
maisie
would
die
because
he
had
denied
that
she
was
for
jerrold
mind
remembered
everything
and
anticipated
nothing
like
most
men
who
refuse
to
see
or
foresee
trouble
he
was
crushed
by
it
when
it
came
the
remorse
he
felt
might
have
been
less
intolerable
if
he
had
been
alone
in
it
but
day
after
day
his
pain
was
intensified
by
the
sight
of
anne
pain
she
was
exquisitely
vulnerable
and
for
every
pang
that
stabbed
her
he
felt
himself
responsible
what
they
had
done
they
had
done
together
and
they
suffered
for
it
together
but
in
the
beginning
she
had
done
it
for
him
and
he
had
made
her
do
it
nobody
not
even
maisie
could
have
been
more
innocent
than
anne
he
had
no
doubt
that
left
to
herself
she
would
have
hidden
her
passion
from
him
to
the
end
of
time
he
therefore
was
the
cause
of
her
suffering
it
was
as
if
anne
consciousness
were
transferred
to
him
day
after
day
when
they
sat
together
in
maisie
room
one
on
each
side
of
her
bed
while
maisie
lay
between
them
sleeping
her
helpless
and
reproachful
sleep
and
he
saw
anne
piteous
face
white
with
pain
his
pity
for
maisie
and
his
pity
for
anne
their
pity
for
each
other
were
mixed
together
and
held
them
close
as
passion
in
an
unbearable
communion
they
looked
at
each
other
and
their
wounded
eyes
said
day
after
day
the
same
thing
yes
it
hurts
but
i
could
bear
it
if
it
were
not
for
you
their
pity
took
the
place
of
passion
it
was
as
if
a
part
of
each
other
passed
into
them
with
their
suffering
as
it
had
passed
into
them
with
their
joy
ii
and
through
it
all
their
passion
itself
still
lived
its
inextinguishable
and
tortured
life
pity
so
far
from
destroying
it
only
made
it
stronger
pouring
in
its
own
emotion
wave
after
wave
swelling
the
flood
that
carried
them
towards
the
warm
darkness
where
will
and
thought
would
cease
and
as
jerrold
soul
had
once
stirred
in
the
warm
darkness
under
the
first
stinging
of
remorse
so
now
it
pushed
and
struggled
to
be
born
all
his
will
fought
against
the
darkness
to
deliver
his
soul
his
soul
knew
that
anne
saved
it
if
her
will
had
been
weaker
his
would
not
have
been
so
strong
at
this
moment
an
unscrupulous
anne
might
have
damned
him
to
the
sensual
hell
by
clinging
to
his
pity
he
would
have
sinned
because
he
was
sorry
for
her
but
anne
will
refused
his
pity
when
he
showed
it
she
was
angry
yet
it
was
there
waiting
for
her
always
against
her
will
one
day
in
october
maisie
illness
lasting
on
into
the
autumn
they
had
gone
out
into
the
garden
to
breathe
the
cold
clean
air
while
maisie
slept
jerrold
she
said
suddenly
do
you
think
she
knows
no
i
certain
she
does
i
not
i
an
awful
feeling
that
she
knows
and
that
why
she
does
get
better
i
do
think
so
if
she
knew
she
have
said
something
or
done
something
she
might
she
might
do
anything
perhaps
she
just
being
angelically
good
to
us
she
angelically
good
but
she
does
know
you
forget
her
illness
began
before
there
anything
to
know
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
she
think
of
if
somebody
told
her
she
would
believe
it
she
trusts
us
absolutely
that
bad
enough
anne
without
her
knowing
yes
it
bad
enough
it
worse
really
i
know
it
is
anne
i
awfully
sorry
to
have
let
you
in
for
all
this
misery
you
must
be
sorry
you
have
let
me
in
for
it
nobody
could
have
known
it
would
have
happened
it
would
if
maisie
had
been
different
we
would
have
bothered
then
nothing
would
have
mattered
think
how
gloriously
happy
we
were
all
my
life
all
my
happiness
has
come
through
you
or
because
of
you
we
be
happy
still
if
it
was
for
maisie
i
do
see
how
we
to
go
on
like
this
i
ca
stand
it
when
not
happy
and
nothing
makes
any
difference
really
i
want
you
so
awfully
all
the
time
that
one
of
the
things
we
must
say
to
each
other
i
know
we
must
only
i
did
want
you
to
think
i
did
i
do
think
it
i
know
you
care
for
me
as
long
as
you
live
only
you
must
say
so
you
must
be
sorry
for
me
it
makes
me
feel
all
weak
and
soft
when
i
want
to
be
strong
and
hard
you
strong
anne
so
are
you
i
should
love
you
if
you
were
but
we
must
make
it
too
hard
for
each
other
you
know
what
happen
if
we
do
what
you
mean
we
crumple
up
and
give
in
no
but
we
could
ever
see
each
other
alone
again
never
see
each
other
again
at
all
perhaps
i
have
to
go
away
you
sha
have
to
i
swear
i
wo
say
another
word
sometimes
i
think
it
would
be
easier
for
you
if
i
went
it
would
it
would
be
simply
damnable
you
ca
go
anne
that
make
maisie
think
iii
after
weeks
of
rest
maisie
passed
into
a
period
of
painless
tranquillity
she
had
no
longer
any
fear
of
her
illness
because
she
had
no
longer
any
fear
of
jerrold
knowing
about
it
he
did
know
and
yet
her
world
stood
firm
round
her
firmer
than
when
he
had
not
known
for
she
had
now
in
jerrold
ceaseless
devotion
what
seemed
to
her
the
absolute
proof
that
he
cared
for
her
if
she
had
ever
doubted
it
and
if
he
had
doubted
her
had
he
the
absolute
proof
that
she
cared
desperately
would
she
have
so
hidden
the
truth
from
him
would
she
have
borne
her
pain
and
the
fear
of
it
in
that
awful
lonely
secrecy
if
she
had
not
cared
for
him
more
than
for
anything
on
earth
she
had
been
more
afraid
to
sleep
alone
than
poor
colin
who
had
waked
them
with
his
screaming
jerrold
knew
that
she
was
not
a
brave
woman
like
anne
or
colin
wife
queenie
it
was
out
of
her
love
for
him
that
she
had
drawn
the
courage
that
made
her
face
night
after
night
the
horror
of
her
torment
alone
if
he
had
wanted
proof
what
better
proof
could
he
have
than
that
so
maisie
remained
tranquil
secure
in
her
love
for
jerrold
and
in
his
love
for
her
while
anne
and
jerrold
were
tortured
by
their
love
for
each
other
they
were
no
longer
sustained
in
their
renunciation
by
the
sight
of
maisie
illness
and
the
fear
of
it
which
more
than
anything
had
held
back
their
passion
without
that
warning
fear
they
were
exposed
at
every
turn
it
might
be
there
waiting
for
them
in
the
background
but
with
maisie
going
about
as
if
nothing
had
happened
even
remorse
had
lost
its
protective
poignancy
they
suffered
the
strain
of
perpetual
frustration
they
were
never
alone
together
now
they
had
passed
from
each
other
beyond
all
contact
of
spirit
with
spirit
and
flesh
with
flesh
beyond
all
words
and
looks
of
longing
they
had
nothing
of
each
other
but
sight
sight
that
had
all
the
violence
of
touch
without
its
satisfaction
that
served
only
to
excite
them
to
torture
them
with
desire
they
might
be
held
at
arm
length
at
a
room
length
at
a
field
length
apart
but
their
eyes
drew
them
together
set
their
hearts
beating
in
one
moment
of
seeing
they
were
joined
and
put
asunder
and
day
after
day
their
minds
desired
each
other
with
a
subtle
incessant
intensely
conscious
longing
and
were
utterly
cut
off
from
all
communion
they
met
now
at
longer
and
longer
intervals
for
their
work
separated
them
colin
had
come
home
in
october
perfectly
recovered
and
he
and
jerrold
managed
the
manor
estate
together
while
anne
looked
after
her
own
farm
jerrold
never
saw
her
he
never
tried
to
see
her
unless
colin
or
maisie
or
some
of
the
farm
people
were
present
he
was
afraid
and
anne
knew
that
he
was
afraid
her
sense
of
his
danger
made
her
feel
herself
fragile
and
unstable
she
too
avoided
every
occasion
of
seeing
him
alone
and
this
separation
so
far
from
saving
them
defeated
its
own
end
every
day
it
brought
them
nearer
to
the
breaking
point
it
was
against
all
nature
and
all
nature
was
against
it
they
had
always
before
them
that
vision
of
the
point
at
which
they
would
give
in
always
there
was
one
thought
that
drew
them
to
the
edge
of
surrender
i
can
bear
it
for
myself
but
i
ca
bear
it
for
him
i
can
bear
it
for
myself
but
i
ca
bear
it
for
her
and
to
both
of
them
had
come
another
fear
greater
than
their
dread
of
maisie
pain
the
fear
of
each
other
illness
their
splendid
physical
health
was
beginning
to
break
down
they
worked
harder
than
ever
on
the
land
but
hard
work
exhausted
them
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
went
on
from
a
sense
of
duty
dull
and
implacable
but
they
had
no
more
pleasure
in
it
anne
became
every
night
more
restless
every
day
more
tired
and
anaemic
jerrold
ate
less
and
slept
less
they
grew
thin
and
their
faces
took
on
the
same
look
of
fatigue
and
anxiety
and
wonder
as
if
more
than
anything
they
were
amazed
at
a
world
whose
being
connived
at
and
tolerated
their
pain
maisie
saw
it
and
felt
the
first
vague
disturbance
of
her
peace
her
illness
had
worried
everybody
while
it
lasted
but
she
could
think
why
when
she
was
well
again
anne
and
jerrold
should
go
on
looking
like
that
maisie
thought
it
was
physical
the
poor
dears
worked
too
hard
the
change
had
been
so
gradual
that
she
saw
it
without
consternation
but
when
eliot
came
down
in
november
he
could
hide
his
distress
to
eliot
the
significant
thing
was
not
anne
illness
or
jerrold
illness
but
the
likeness
in
their
illnesses
the
likeness
in
their
faces
it
was
clear
that
they
suffered
together
with
the
same
suffering
from
the
same
cause
and
when
on
his
last
evening
jerrold
took
him
into
the
library
to
consult
him
about
maisie
case
eliot
had
a
hard
straight
talk
with
him
about
his
own
my
dear
jerrold
he
said
there
nothing
seriously
wrong
with
maisie
i
examined
her
heart
it
is
a
particularly
strong
heart
but
there
no
disease
in
it
if
you
took
her
to
all
the
specialists
in
europe
they
tell
you
the
same
thing
i
know
but
i
keep
on
worrying
that
my
dear
chap
is
because
you
ill
yourself
i
do
like
it
i
not
bothered
about
maisie
but
i
am
bothered
about
you
and
anne
anne
do
you
think
ill
i
think
she
will
be
and
so
will
you
if
what
have
you
been
doing
we
been
doing
nothing
that
it
you
got
to
do
something
and
do
it
pretty
quick
if
it
to
be
any
good
jerrold
started
and
looked
up
he
wondered
whether
eliot
knew
he
had
a
way
of
getting
at
things
you
could
tell
how
what
mean
what
are
you
talking
about
his
words
came
with
a
sudden
sharp
rapidity
you
know
what
i
mean
i
do
know
how
know
anything
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
do
i
do
know
much
but
i
know
enough
to
see
that
you
two
ca
go
on
like
this
maisie
and
me
no
you
and
anne
it
anne
i
talking
about
i
suppose
you
can
make
a
mess
of
your
own
life
if
you
like
you
no
business
to
make
a
mess
of
hers
my
god
as
if
i
did
know
it
what
the
devil
am
i
to
do
leave
her
alone
jerrold
if
you
ca
have
her
leave
her
alone
i
leaving
her
alone
i
got
to
leave
her
alone
if
we
both
die
of
it
she
ought
to
go
away
eliot
said
she
sha
go
away
unless
i
go
with
her
and
i
ca
well
then
it
an
impossible
situation
it
a
damnable
situation
but
it
the
only
decent
one
you
forget
there
maisie
no
i
do
maisie
does
know
oh
lord
no
and
she
never
will
you
ought
to
tell
her
jerrold
was
silent
my
dear
jerrold
it
the
only
sensible
thing
tell
her
straight
and
get
her
to
divorce
you
i
was
going
to
then
she
got
ill
and
i
could
she
is
ill
now
she
will
be
if
i
tell
her
it
simply
kill
her
it
wo
it
may
even
cure
her
it
make
her
frightfully
unhappy
and
it
bring
back
that
infernal
pain
if
you
seen
her
eliot
you
know
how
impossible
it
is
we
simply
ca
be
swine
and
if
i
could
anne
could
no
we
got
to
stick
it
somehow
anne
and
i
it
all
wrong
jerrold
i
know
it
all
wrong
but
it
the
best
we
can
do
you
do
suppose
anne
would
be
happy
if
we
did
maisie
down
no
no
she
would
you
right
there
but
it
a
damnable
business
oh
damnable
yes
jerrold
laughed
in
his
agony
yet
he
saw
as
if
he
had
never
seen
it
before
eliot
goodness
and
the
sadness
and
beauty
of
his
love
for
anne
he
had
borne
for
years
what
jerrold
was
bearing
now
and
anne
had
not
loved
him
he
had
never
known
for
one
moment
the
bliss
of
love
or
any
joy
he
had
had
nothing
and
jerrold
remembered
with
a
pang
of
contrition
that
he
had
never
cared
enough
for
eliot
it
had
always
been
colin
the
young
breakable
colin
who
had
clung
to
him
and
followed
him
eliot
had
always
gone
his
own
queer
way
keeping
himself
apart
and
now
eliot
was
nearer
to
him
than
anything
in
the
world
except
anne
i
sorry
jerrold
you
pretty
decent
eliot
to
be
sorry
i
believe
you
honestly
want
me
to
have
anne
i
would
go
so
far
as
that
old
man
but
i
believe
i
honestly
want
anne
to
have
you
i
say
she
has
gone
yet
has
she
no
maisie
keeping
her
for
dinner
in
your
honour
you
probably
find
her
in
the
now
where
maisie
she
wo
worry
you
she
gone
to
lie
down
eliot
went
into
the
and
found
anne
there
she
looked
at
him
you
been
talking
to
jerrold
she
said
yes
anne
i
worried
about
him
so
am
i
and
i
worried
about
you
and
he
worried
about
maisie
yes
i
suppose
he
began
by
not
seeing
she
was
ill
and
now
he
does
see
it
he
thinks
she
going
to
die
i
been
trying
to
explain
to
him
that
she
is
can
you
explain
why
she
got
into
this
state
it
not
as
if
she
was
happy
she
happy
she
was
always
happy
jerrold
must
have
made
her
suffer
damnably
when
oh
long
before
he
married
her
but
did
he
make
her
suffer
oh
by
just
not
marrying
her
she
found
out
he
did
care
for
her
her
people
took
her
out
to
india
i
believe
with
the
idea
that
he
would
marry
her
and
when
they
saw
that
jerry
was
on
in
that
act
they
sent
her
back
again
poor
maisie
got
it
well
rammed
into
her
then
that
he
did
care
for
her
and
the
idea
stuck
it
left
a
sort
of
wound
in
her
memory
but
she
must
have
thought
he
cared
for
her
when
he
did
marry
her
she
thinks
he
cares
now
of
course
she
thinks
it
i
do
suppose
he
ever
let
her
see
i
know
he
has
but
the
wound
there
all
the
same
she
never
got
over
it
though
she
is
conscious
of
it
now
the
fact
remains
that
maisie
marriage
is
incomplete
because
jerry
does
care
for
her
part
of
maisie
the
adorable
part
we
know
is
aware
of
any
incompleteness
it
lives
in
a
perpetual
illusion
but
the
part
we
do
know
the
hidden
secret
part
of
her
is
aware
of
nothing
else
well
her
illness
is
simply
camouflage
for
that
maisie
mind
could
bear
the
reality
so
it
escaped
into
a
neurosis
maisie
behaving
as
though
she
was
married
so
that
her
mind
can
say
to
itself
that
her
marriage
is
incomplete
because
she
ill
not
because
jerry
does
care
for
her
substituted
a
bearable
situation
for
an
unbearable
one
then
you
do
think
she
that
jerrold
does
care
for
her
no
only
in
that
unconscious
way
her
mind
remembers
and
does
i
mean
she
does
know
about
jerrold
and
me
i
sure
she
does
if
she
did
she
do
something
that
what
jerrold
said
what
would
she
do
oh
something
beautiful
or
it
would
be
maisie
she
let
jerrold
go
yes
she
let
him
go
and
she
die
of
it
oh
no
she
would
i
told
jerrold
just
now
it
might
cure
her
how
it
cure
her
by
making
her
face
reality
by
making
her
see
that
her
illness
simply
means
that
she
has
faced
it
all
our
neuroses
come
because
we
live
with
the
truth
it
no
good
making
maisie
well
if
we
make
her
unhappy
besides
i
do
believe
it
if
maisie
unhappy
she
be
worse
not
better
there
just
that
risk
he
said
but
it
you
i
thinking
about
not
maisie
you
see
i
do
know
what
happened
jerrold
did
tell
you
he
only
told
me
what
i
know
already
after
all
what
you
know
i
know
you
were
all
right
you
and
he
when
i
saw
you
together
here
in
the
spring
so
i
suppose
you
were
happy
then
jerrold
looked
wretchedly
ill
all
the
time
he
was
at
taormina
so
i
suppose
he
was
unhappy
then
because
he
was
away
from
you
he
looks
wretchedly
ill
now
so
do
you
so
i
suppose
you
both
unhappy
yes
we
both
unhappy
do
you
want
to
tell
me
about
it
anne
no
i
do
want
to
tell
you
about
it
only
if
i
thought
you
still
wanted
to
marry
me
i
do
want
to
marry
you
i
shall
always
want
to
marry
you
i
told
you
long
ago
nothing
would
ever
make
any
difference
even
if
even
if
whatever
you
did
or
did
do
i
still
want
you
but
i
told
you
do
you
remember
that
you
could
never
do
anything
dishonourable
or
cruel
and
i
told
you
i
was
sure
and
i
am
sure
that
enough
for
me
i
do
want
to
know
anything
more
i
do
want
to
know
anything
you
rather
i
did
know
oh
eliot
you
so
good
you
good
like
maisie
do
worry
about
jerry
and
me
we
see
it
through
somehow
and
if
you
ca
stand
the
strain
of
it
but
i
can
and
if
ca
if
you
want
to
be
safe
i
told
you
i
should
never
want
to
be
safe
if
you
want
to
be
safe
then
would
you
marry
me
that
different
i
do
know
eliot
but
i
do
think
so
he
went
away
with
a
faint
hope
she
had
said
it
would
be
different
what
she
would
never
do
for
him
she
might
do
for
jerrold
she
might
after
all
marry
him
to
keep
jerrold
safe
nothing
made
any
difference
whatever
anne
did
she
would
still
be
anne
and
it
was
anne
he
loved
and
after
all
what
did
he
know
about
her
and
jerrold
only
that
if
they
had
been
lovers
that
would
account
for
their
strange
happiness
seven
months
ago
if
they
had
given
each
other
up
this
would
account
for
their
unhappiness
now
he
thought
how
they
must
have
struggled
perhaps
some
day
when
the
whole
story
was
told
and
anne
was
tired
of
struggling
she
would
come
to
him
and
he
would
marry
her
even
if
xviii
jerrold
and
anne
i
the
barrow
farm
house
long
low
and
grey
stood
back
behind
the
tall
elms
and
turned
its
blank
north
gable
end
to
the
road
and
the
manor
farm
its
nine
mullioned
windows
looked
down
the
field
to
the
river
and
the
great
barns
were
piled
behind
it
long
steep
slopes
and
peaks
above
grey
walls
anne
did
move
into
the
barrow
farm
house
all
at
once
she
had
to
wait
while
jerrold
had
the
place
made
beautiful
for
her
this
was
the
only
thing
that
roused
him
to
any
interest
through
all
his
misery
he
could
still
find
pleasure
in
the
work
of
throwing
small
rooms
into
one
to
make
more
space
for
anne
and
putting
windows
into
the
south
gable
to
give
her
the
sun
anne
garden
absorbed
him
more
than
his
own
seven
hundred
acres
maisie
and
he
planned
it
together
walking
round
the
rank
and
bald
wastes
scratched
up
by
the
hens
there
was
to
be
a
flagged
court
on
one
side
and
a
grass
plot
on
the
other
with
a
flower
garden
between
here
maisie
said
there
should
be
great
clumps
of
larkspurs
and
there
a
lavender
hedge
they
said
how
nice
it
would
be
for
anne
to
watch
the
garden
grow
he
going
to
make
it
so
beautiful
that
you
want
to
stay
in
it
forever
she
said
and
anne
went
with
them
and
listened
to
them
and
told
them
they
were
angels
and
pretended
to
be
excited
about
her
house
and
garden
while
all
the
time
her
heart
ached
and
she
was
too
tired
to
care
the
house
was
finished
by
the
end
of
november
and
jerrold
and
maisie
helped
her
to
furnish
it
maisie
sent
to
london
for
patterns
and
brought
them
to
anne
to
choose
maisie
thought
perhaps
the
chintz
with
the
cream
and
pink
roses
or
the
one
with
the
green
leaves
and
red
tulips
and
blue
and
purple
clematis
was
the
prettiest
anne
tried
to
behave
as
if
all
her
happiness
depended
on
a
pattern
and
ended
by
choosing
the
one
that
maisie
liked
best
and
the
furniture
went
where
maisie
thought
it
should
go
because
anne
was
too
tired
to
care
besides
she
was
busy
on
her
farm
old
sutton
in
his
decadence
had
let
most
of
his
arable
land
run
to
waste
and
anne
job
was
to
make
good
soil
again
out
of
bad
maisie
was
pleased
like
a
child
and
excited
with
her
planning
her
idea
was
that
anne
should
come
in
from
her
work
on
the
land
and
find
the
house
all
ready
for
her
everything
in
its
place
chairs
and
sofas
dressed
in
their
gay
suits
of
chintz
the
books
on
their
shelves
the
china
in
rows
on
the
oak
dresser
tea
was
set
out
on
the
table
before
the
wide
the
lamps
were
lit
a
big
fire
burned
colin
and
jerrold
and
maisie
were
there
waiting
for
her
and
anne
came
in
out
of
the
fields
tired
and
white
and
thin
her
black
hair
drooping
her
rough
land
dress
hung
slack
on
her
slender
body
jerrold
looked
at
her
anne
tired
face
trying
to
smile
wrung
his
heart
so
did
the
happiness
in
maisie
eyes
and
anne
voice
trying
to
sound
as
if
she
were
happy
you
darlings
how
nice
you
made
it
do
you
like
it
maisie
was
breathless
with
joy
i
love
it
i
adore
it
but
are
there
lots
of
things
that
here
before
where
did
that
table
come
from
from
the
manor
farm
do
you
remember
it
that
eliot
and
the
bureau
and
the
dresser
and
those
heavenly
rugs
that
jerrold
and
the
china
was
colin
and
the
chintz
was
maisie
the
long
couch
for
anne
to
lie
down
on
was
maisie
everything
that
was
not
anne
they
had
given
her
you
should
have
done
it
she
said
we
did
it
for
ourselves
to
keep
you
with
us
said
maisie
did
you
think
it
would
take
all
that
she
wondered
whether
they
saw
how
hard
she
was
trying
to
look
happy
not
to
be
too
tired
to
care
then
maisie
took
her
upstairs
to
show
her
her
bedroom
and
the
white
bathroom
colin
carried
the
lamp
he
left
them
together
in
anne
room
maisie
turned
to
her
there
darling
how
tired
you
look
are
you
too
tired
to
be
happy
i
be
a
brute
if
i
were
happy
anne
said
but
she
was
happy
the
minute
they
were
gone
her
sadness
came
upon
her
crushing
her
down
she
could
hear
colin
and
maisie
the
two
innocent
ones
laughing
out
into
the
darkness
she
saw
again
hard
unhappy
face
trying
to
smile
his
mouth
jerking
in
the
tight
difficult
smile
that
was
like
an
agony
and
it
used
to
be
jerrold
who
was
always
happy
who
went
laughing
she
turned
up
and
down
the
beautiful
lighted
room
she
looked
again
and
again
at
the
things
they
had
given
her
colin
and
jerrold
and
maisie
maisie
she
would
have
to
live
with
the
cruelty
of
maisie
gifts
with
maisie
wounding
kindness
and
her
innocence
maisie
curtains
maisie
couch
covered
with
flowers
that
smiled
at
her
gay
on
the
white
ground
she
thought
of
the
other
house
of
the
curtains
that
had
shut
out
the
light
from
her
and
jerrold
of
the
couch
where
she
had
lain
in
his
arms
each
object
had
a
dumb
but
poignant
life
that
reminded
and
reproached
her
this
was
the
scene
where
her
life
was
to
be
cast
henceforth
these
things
would
know
her
in
her
desolation
jerrold
would
never
come
to
her
here
as
he
had
come
to
the
manor
farm
house
they
would
never
sit
together
talking
by
this
fireside
those
curtains
would
never
be
drawn
on
their
passion
he
would
never
go
up
to
that
lamp
and
put
it
out
she
would
never
lie
here
waiting
thrilling
as
he
came
to
her
through
the
darkness
she
had
wanted
the
barrow
farm
and
she
had
got
what
she
had
wanted
and
she
had
got
it
too
late
she
loved
it
yet
how
was
it
possible
to
love
the
place
that
she
was
to
be
so
unhappy
in
she
ought
to
hate
it
with
its
enclosing
walls
its
watching
furniture
its
air
of
quiet
complicity
in
her
pain
she
drew
back
the
curtains
the
lamp
and
its
yellow
flame
hung
out
there
on
the
darkness
of
the
fields
the
fields
dropped
away
through
the
darkness
to
the
river
and
there
were
the
black
masses
of
the
trees
there
the
earth
waited
for
her
out
there
was
the
only
life
left
for
her
to
live
the
life
of
struggling
with
the
earth
forcing
the
earth
to
yield
to
her
more
than
it
had
yielded
to
the
men
who
had
tilled
it
before
her
making
the
bad
land
good
ploughing
time
would
come
and
seed
time
and
hay
harvest
and
corn
harvest
feeding
time
and
milking
time
would
come
she
would
go
on
seeing
the
same
things
done
at
the
same
hour
at
the
same
season
day
after
day
and
year
after
year
there
would
have
been
joy
in
that
if
it
had
been
jerrold
land
if
she
could
have
gone
on
working
for
jerrold
and
with
jerrold
and
if
she
had
not
been
so
tired
she
was
only
and
jerrold
was
only
she
wondered
how
many
more
ploughing
times
they
would
have
to
go
through
how
many
seed
times
and
harvests
and
how
would
they
go
through
them
would
they
go
on
getting
more
and
more
tired
or
would
something
happen
no
nothing
would
happen
nothing
that
they
could
bear
to
think
of
they
would
just
go
on
in
the
stillness
of
the
house
she
could
feel
her
heart
beating
measuring
out
time
measuring
out
her
pain
ii
that
winter
adeline
and
john
severn
came
down
to
wyck
manor
for
christmas
and
the
new
year
adeline
was
sitting
in
the
with
maisie
in
the
heavy
hour
before
tea
time
all
afternoon
she
had
been
trying
to
talk
to
maisie
and
she
was
now
bored
jerrold
wife
had
always
bored
her
she
imagine
why
jerrold
had
married
her
when
it
was
so
clear
that
he
was
not
in
love
with
her
it
funny
she
said
at
last
staying
in
your
own
house
when
it
your
own
any
more
maisie
hoped
that
adeline
would
treat
the
house
as
if
it
were
her
own
i
probably
shall
do
be
surprised
if
you
hear
me
giving
orders
to
the
servants
i
really
can
not
consider
that
wilkins
belongs
to
anybody
but
me
maisie
hoped
that
adeline
would
consider
that
he
did
and
there
was
a
pause
adeline
looked
at
the
clock
and
saw
that
there
was
still
another
till
tea
time
how
could
they
possibly
fill
it
in
then
suddenly
from
a
thought
of
jerrold
so
incredibly
married
to
maisie
adeline
mind
wandered
to
anne
is
anne
dining
here
tonight
she
said
and
maisie
said
yes
she
thought
adeline
and
severn
would
like
to
see
as
much
as
possible
of
anne
and
adeline
said
that
was
very
kind
of
maisie
and
was
bored
again
she
saw
nothing
before
her
but
more
and
more
boredom
and
the
subject
of
anne
alone
held
out
the
prospect
of
relief
she
flew
to
it
as
she
would
have
fled
from
any
danger
by
the
way
maisie
if
i
were
you
i
would
let
anne
see
too
much
of
jerrold
why
not
because
my
dear
it
is
good
for
her
i
should
have
thought
maisie
said
it
was
very
good
for
both
of
them
as
they
like
each
other
i
should
never
dream
of
interfering
with
their
friendship
that
the
way
people
get
themselves
thoroughly
disliked
i
do
want
jerry
to
dislike
me
or
anne
either
i
like
them
to
feel
that
if
he
married
they
can
go
on
being
friends
just
the
same
oh
of
course
if
you
like
it
i
do
like
it
said
maisie
firmly
firm
opposition
was
a
thing
that
adeline
wilfulness
could
never
stand
it
always
made
her
either
change
the
subject
or
revert
to
her
original
statement
this
time
she
reverted
my
point
was
that
it
is
fair
to
anne
why
is
it
because
she
in
love
with
him
that
said
maisie
with
increasing
decision
i
do
believe
never
seen
any
signs
of
it
you
the
only
person
who
has
then
it
sticks
out
of
her
if
it
was
a
secret
i
should
have
told
you
it
is
a
secret
to
me
said
maisie
so
i
think
you
might
let
it
alone
you
ought
to
know
it
if
nobody
else
does
we
all
of
us
known
about
anne
for
ages
she
was
always
quite
mad
about
jerrold
it
was
funny
when
she
was
a
little
thing
but
it
rather
more
serious
now
she
thirty
she
is
thirty
said
maisie
contradictiously
almost
thirty
it
a
dangerous
age
maisie
and
anne
a
dangerous
person
she
absolutely
reckless
she
always
was
i
thought
you
thought
she
was
in
love
with
colin
i
never
thought
it
maisie
hated
people
who
lied
to
her
why
did
you
tell
jerrold
they
were
lovers
then
she
said
did
i
tell
jerrold
they
were
lovers
he
thinks
you
did
he
must
have
misunderstood
what
i
said
colin
gave
me
his
word
of
honour
that
there
was
nothing
between
them
but
maisie
had
no
mercy
why
should
he
do
that
if
you
did
think
there
was
if
you
were
mistaken
then
you
may
be
mistaken
now
i
not
mistaken
now
ask
colin
ask
eliot
ask
anne
father
i
should
dream
of
asking
them
you
forget
if
jerrold
my
husband
anne
my
friend
then
for
goodness
sake
keep
her
out
of
mischief
keep
her
out
of
jerrold
way
anne
a
darling
and
i
devoted
to
her
but
she
always
did
love
playing
with
fire
if
she
bent
on
burning
her
pretty
wings
it
is
kind
to
bring
her
where
the
lamp
is
i
trust
anne
wings
to
keep
her
out
of
danger
how
about
jerrold
danger
you
might
think
of
him
i
do
think
of
him
and
i
trust
him
absolutely
i
do
i
do
trust
anybody
absolutely
one
thing
clear
said
maisie
that
it
time
we
had
tea
she
got
up
with
an
annihilating
dignity
and
rang
the
bell
smile
intimated
that
she
was
unbeaten
and
unconvinced
that
evening
john
severn
came
into
his
wife
room
as
she
was
dressing
for
dinner
i
wish
to
goodness
anne
had
this
craze
for
farming
he
said
simply
working
herself
to
death
i
never
saw
her
look
so
seedy
sorry
jerrold
let
her
have
that
farm
so
am
i
said
adeline
i
never
saw
jerry
look
so
seedy
either
maisie
been
behaving
like
a
perfect
idiot
if
she
wanted
them
to
go
off
together
she
could
have
done
better
you
do
imagine
john
said
that
what
they
after
how
do
i
know
what
they
after
you
never
can
tell
with
people
like
jerrold
and
anne
they
both
utterly
reckless
they
do
care
who
suffers
so
long
as
they
get
what
they
want
if
anne
had
the
morals
of
a
of
a
mouse
she
clear
out
i
think
john
said
you
mistaken
anne
is
like
that
i
hope
you
have
said
anything
to
maisie
adeline
made
a
face
at
him
as
much
as
to
say
what
do
you
take
me
for
she
lifted
up
her
charming
wilful
face
and
powdered
it
carefully
iii
the
earth
smelt
of
the
coming
rain
all
night
the
trees
had
whispered
of
rain
coming
now
they
waited
at
noon
the
wind
dropped
thick
clouds
the
colour
of
dirty
wool
packed
tight
by
their
own
movement
roofed
the
sky
and
walled
it
round
hanging
close
to
the
horizon
a
slight
heaving
and
swelling
in
the
grey
mass
packed
it
tighter
it
was
pregnant
with
rain
here
and
there
a
steaming
vapour
broke
from
it
as
if
puffed
out
by
some
immense
interior
commotion
thin
tissues
detached
themselves
and
hung
like
a
frayed
hem
lengthening
streaming
to
the
hilltops
in
the
west
anne
was
going
up
the
fields
towards
the
manor
and
jerrold
was
coming
down
towards
the
manor
farm
they
met
at
the
plantation
as
the
first
big
drops
fell
he
called
out
to
her
i
say
you
ought
to
be
out
a
day
like
this
anne
had
been
ill
all
january
with
a
slight
touch
of
pleurisy
after
a
cold
that
she
had
taken
no
care
of
i
going
to
see
maisie
you
he
said
it
going
to
rain
like
fury
maisie
knows
i
do
mind
rain
anne
said
and
laughed
maisie
have
a
fit
if
she
knew
you
were
out
in
it
look
how
coming
down
over
there
westwards
and
northwards
the
round
roof
and
walls
of
cloud
were
shaken
and
the
black
rain
hung
sheeted
between
sky
and
earth
overhead
the
dark
tissues
thinned
out
and
lengthened
the
fir
trees
quivered
they
gave
out
slight
creaking
crackling
noises
as
the
rain
came
down
it
poured
off
each
of
the
sloping
fir
branches
like
a
jet
from
a
tap
we
must
make
a
dash
for
it
jerrold
said
and
they
ran
together
laughing
down
the
field
to
anne
shelter
at
the
bottom
he
pushed
back
the
sliding
door
the
rain
drummed
on
the
roof
and
went
hissing
along
the
soaked
ground
it
sprayed
out
as
the
grass
bent
and
parted
under
it
every
hollow
tuft
was
a
water
spout
the
fields
were
dim
behind
the
shining
glassy
bead
curtain
of
the
rain
the
wind
rose
again
and
shook
the
rain
curtain
and
blew
it
into
the
shelter
rain
scudded
across
the
floor
wetting
them
where
they
stood
jerrold
slid
the
door
to
they
were
safe
now
from
the
downpour
anne
bed
stood
in
the
corner
tucked
up
in
its
grey
blankets
they
sat
down
on
it
side
by
side
for
a
moment
they
were
silent
held
by
their
memory
they
were
shut
in
there
with
their
past
it
came
up
to
them
close
and
living
out
of
the
bright
alien
mystery
of
the
rain
he
put
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
anne
coat
to
feel
if
it
was
wet
at
his
touch
she
trembled
it
has
gone
through
has
it
no
she
said
and
coughed
again
anne
i
hate
that
cough
of
yours
you
never
had
a
cough
before
i
never
had
pleurisy
before
you
would
have
had
it
if
you
had
been
frightfully
run
down
it
all
over
now
she
said
it
is
you
may
get
it
again
i
do
feel
as
if
you
were
safe
for
one
minute
are
you
warm
quite
are
your
feet
wet
no
no
no
do
worry
jerry
dear
i
all
right
i
would
worry
if
i
was
with
you
all
the
time
it
not
seeing
you
not
knowing
do
she
said
i
ca
bear
it
and
they
were
silent
again
their
silence
was
more
real
to
them
than
the
sounding
storm
there
was
danger
in
it
it
drew
them
back
and
back
it
was
poignant
and
reminiscent
it
came
to
them
like
the
long
stillness
before
their
passion
they
had
waited
here
before
like
this
through
moments
tense
and
increasing
for
the
supreme
toppling
instant
of
their
joy
their
minds
went
round
and
round
looking
for
words
to
break
the
silence
and
finding
none
they
were
held
there
by
their
danger
at
last
anne
spoke
do
you
think
it
over
no
it
only
just
begun
the
rain
hurled
itself
against
the
window
as
if
it
would
pluck
them
out
into
the
storm
it
brimmed
over
from
the
roof
like
water
poured
out
from
a
bucket
we
have
to
sit
tight
till
it
stops
he
said
silence
again
long
inveterate
dangerous
every
now
and
then
anne
coughed
the
short
hard
cough
that
hurt
and
frightened
him
he
knew
he
ought
to
leave
her
every
minute
increased
their
danger
but
he
go
he
felt
that
after
all
they
might
have
done
and
had
done
heaven
had
some
scheme
of
compensation
in
which
it
owed
them
this
moment
she
turned
from
him
coughing
and
that
sign
of
her
weakness
the
sight
of
her
thin
shoulders
shaking
filled
him
with
pity
that
was
passion
itself
he
thought
of
the
injustice
life
had
heaped
on
anne
innocence
of
the
cruelty
that
had
tracked
her
and
hunted
her
down
of
his
own
complicity
with
her
suffering
he
thought
of
his
pity
for
maisie
as
treachery
to
anne
of
his
honour
as
cowardice
instead
of
piling
up
wall
after
wall
he
ought
never
to
have
let
anything
come
between
him
and
anne
not
even
maisie
not
even
his
honour
his
honour
belonged
to
anne
far
more
than
to
maisie
the
rest
had
been
his
own
blundering
folly
and
he
had
no
right
to
let
anne
be
punished
for
it
an
hour
ago
the
walls
had
stood
solid
between
them
now
a
furious
impulse
seized
him
to
tear
them
down
and
get
through
to
her
this
time
he
would
hold
her
and
never
let
her
go
his
thoughts
went
the
way
his
passion
went
then
suddenly
she
turned
and
they
looked
at
each
other
and
he
thought
no
more
all
his
thoughts
went
down
in
the
hot
rushing
darkness
of
his
blood
anne
he
said
anne
his
voice
sounded
like
a
cry
they
stood
up
suddenly
and
were
swept
together
he
held
her
tight
shut
in
his
arms
his
body
straining
to
her
they
clung
to
each
other
as
if
only
by
clinging
they
could
stand
against
the
hot
darkness
that
drowned
them
and
the
more
they
clung
the
more
it
came
over
them
wave
after
wave
then
in
the
darkness
he
heard
her
crying
to
him
to
let
her
go
do
make
me
jerrold
do
make
me
yes
yes
no
oh
why
did
we
ever
come
here
he
pressed
her
closer
and
she
tried
to
push
him
off
with
weak
hands
that
had
once
been
strong
he
felt
her
breakable
in
his
arms
and
utterly
defenceless
i
ca
she
cried
i
should
feel
as
if
maisie
were
there
and
looking
at
us
do
make
me
suddenly
he
let
her
go
he
was
beaten
by
the
sheer
weakness
of
her
struggle
he
could
fight
for
his
flesh
like
a
brute
against
that
helplessness
if
i
go
you
stay
here
till
the
rain
stops
yes
i
sorry
jerry
you
get
so
wet
that
made
him
laugh
and
laughing
he
left
her
then
tears
came
cutting
through
his
eyelids
like
blood
from
a
dry
wound
they
mixed
with
the
rain
and
blinded
him
and
anne
sat
on
the
little
grey
bed
in
her
shelter
and
stared
out
at
the
rain
and
cried
xix
anne
and
eliot
i
she
knew
what
she
would
do
now
she
would
go
away
and
never
see
jerrold
again
never
while
their
youth
lasted
while
they
could
still
feel
she
would
go
out
of
england
so
far
away
that
they
could
meet
she
would
go
to
canada
and
farm
all
night
she
lay
awake
with
her
mind
fixed
on
the
one
thought
of
going
away
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
no
room
for
worry
or
hesitation
they
could
hold
out
any
longer
she
and
jerrold
strained
to
the
tortured
with
the
sight
of
each
other
as
she
lay
awake
there
came
to
her
the
peace
that
comes
with
all
immense
and
clear
decisions
her
mind
would
never
be
torn
and
divided
any
more
and
towards
morning
she
fell
asleep
she
woke
dulled
and
bewildered
her
mind
struggled
with
a
sense
of
appalling
yet
undefined
disaster
something
had
happened
overnight
she
could
remember
what
something
had
happened
no
something
was
going
to
happen
she
tried
to
fall
back
into
sleep
fighting
against
the
return
of
consciousness
it
came
on
wave
after
wave
beating
her
down
now
she
remembered
she
was
going
away
she
would
never
see
jerrold
again
she
was
going
to
canada
the
sharp
clear
name
made
the
whole
thing
real
and
irrevocable
it
was
something
that
would
actually
happen
soon
to
her
she
was
going
and
when
she
had
gone
she
would
not
come
back
she
got
up
and
looked
out
of
the
window
she
saw
the
green
field
sloping
down
to
the
river
and
the
road
and
beyond
the
road
to
the
right
the
rise
of
the
manor
fields
and
the
belt
of
firs
and
in
her
mind
more
real
than
they
the
manor
house
the
garden
and
the
hills
beyond
rolling
curve
after
curve
to
the
straight
horizon
the
scene
that
held
her
childhood
all
her
youth
all
her
happiness
that
had
drawn
her
back
again
and
again
in
memory
and
in
dreams
making
her
heart
ache
how
could
she
leave
it
how
could
she
live
with
that
pain
if
she
was
going
to
be
a
coward
if
she
was
going
to
be
afraid
of
pain
how
was
she
to
escape
it
how
was
jerrold
to
escape
if
she
stayed
on
they
would
break
down
together
and
give
in
they
would
be
lovers
again
and
again
maisie
sweet
wounding
face
would
come
between
them
they
could
never
get
away
from
it
and
in
the
end
their
remorse
would
be
as
unbearable
as
their
separation
she
could
drag
jerrold
through
that
agony
again
no
life
was
worth
living
if
you
were
a
coward
and
afraid
and
under
all
her
misery
anne
had
still
the
sense
that
life
was
somehow
worth
living
even
if
it
made
you
miserable
life
was
either
your
friend
or
your
enemy
if
it
was
your
friend
you
served
it
if
it
was
your
enemy
you
stood
up
to
it
and
refused
to
let
it
beat
you
and
your
enemy
became
your
servant
whatever
happened
your
work
remained
still
there
would
be
ploughing
and
sowing
and
reaping
and
ploughing
again
still
the
earth
waited
she
thought
of
the
unknown
canadian
earth
that
waited
for
her
tilling
jerrold
was
not
a
coward
he
was
not
afraid
well
only
afraid
of
the
people
he
loved
getting
ill
and
dying
and
she
was
not
going
to
get
ill
and
die
she
would
have
to
tell
him
she
would
go
to
him
in
the
fields
and
tell
him
but
before
she
did
that
she
must
make
the
thing
irrevocable
so
anne
wrote
to
the
steamship
company
booking
her
passage
in
two
weeks
time
she
wrote
to
eliot
asking
him
to
call
at
the
company
office
and
see
if
he
could
get
her
a
decent
cabin
she
went
to
wyck
and
posted
her
letters
and
then
to
the
far
acres
field
where
jerrold
was
watching
the
ploughing
they
met
at
the
headland
they
would
be
safe
there
on
the
ploughed
land
in
the
open
air
what
is
it
anne
he
said
nothing
i
want
to
talk
to
you
all
right
her
set
face
her
hard
voice
gave
him
a
premonition
of
disaster
it
simply
this
she
said
what
happened
yesterday
must
happen
again
it
sha
i
swear
it
sha
i
was
a
beast
i
lost
my
head
yes
but
it
may
happen
again
we
ca
go
on
like
this
jerry
the
strain
too
awful
you
mean
you
ca
trust
me
i
ca
trust
myself
and
it
is
fair
to
you
oh
me
that
does
matter
well
then
say
matter
it
the
same
for
me
i
never
going
to
let
that
happen
again
i
going
away
going
away
yes
and
i
not
coming
back
this
time
his
voice
struggled
in
his
throat
something
choked
him
he
speak
i
going
to
canada
in
a
fortnight
good
god
you
ca
go
to
canada
i
can
i
booked
my
passage
his
face
was
suddenly
sallow
white
ghastly
his
heart
heaved
and
he
felt
sick
nothing
on
earth
will
stop
me
wo
maisie
stop
you
if
you
do
this
she
know
ca
you
see
how
it
gives
us
away
no
it
only
give
away
if
maisie
asks
me
why
i
going
i
shall
tell
her
i
in
love
with
you
and
that
i
ca
stand
it
that
i
too
unhappy
i
rather
she
thought
i
cared
for
you
than
that
she
should
think
you
cared
for
me
she
think
it
all
the
same
then
i
shall
have
to
lie
i
must
risk
it
oh
jerry
do
look
so
awful
i
got
to
go
we
settled
it
that
we
ca
go
on
deceiving
her
and
we
are
going
to
make
her
unhappy
there
nothing
else
to
be
done
except
to
bear
it
and
how
long
do
you
suppose
that
last
we
bear
it
look
at
it
straight
it
all
so
horribly
simple
if
we
were
beasts
and
only
thought
of
ourselves
and
did
think
of
maisie
it
would
matter
to
us
what
we
did
but
we
ca
be
beasts
we
ca
lie
to
maisie
and
we
ca
tell
her
the
truth
we
ca
go
on
seeing
each
other
without
wanting
each
other
unbearably
and
we
ca
go
on
wanting
each
other
without
some
day
giving
in
it
comes
back
the
first
minute
alone
and
we
do
mean
to
give
in
so
we
must
see
each
other
that
all
can
you
tell
me
one
other
thing
i
can
do
but
why
should
it
be
why
should
you
get
the
worst
of
it
because
one
of
us
has
got
to
clear
out
it
ca
be
you
so
it
got
to
be
me
and
going
away
is
the
worst
of
it
it
be
worse
for
you
sticking
on
here
where
everything
reminds
you
at
least
i
shall
have
new
things
to
keep
my
mind
off
it
nothing
will
keep
your
mind
off
it
you
fret
yourself
to
death
no
i
sha
i
shall
have
too
much
to
do
you
to
be
sorry
for
me
jerrold
but
you
giving
up
everything
the
barrow
farm
the
place
you
wanted
you
wo
have
a
thing
i
do
want
it
easier
to
chuck
them
than
to
hang
on
to
them
when
they
remind
me
really
if
i
could
see
any
other
way
i
take
it
but
you
ca
go
you
not
fit
to
go
you
i
shall
be
all
right
when
i
get
there
but
what
do
you
think
you
going
to
in
canada
it
not
as
if
you
got
anything
to
go
for
i
shall
find
something
i
shall
work
on
somebody
ranch

canadian
farming

i
shall
look
out
for

stacks
of
money

grandpapa
everitt
and
the
money
for
the
farm

right
when
did
you
think
of
all
this
last
night
i
see
i
made
you
no
i
made
myself
after
all
it
the
easiest
way
for
you
or
me
for
both
of
us
honestly
it
the
only
straight
thing
i
ought
to
have
done
it
long
ago
it
means
never
seeing
each
other
again
you
never
come
back
never
while
we
young
when
we
both
old
too
old
to
feel
any
more
then
i
come
back
some
day
and
we
be
friends
and
still
his
will
beat
against
hers
in
vain
till
at
last
he
stopped
sick
and
exhausted
they
went
together
down
the
ploughed
land
into
the
pastures
and
through
the
pastures
to
the
mill
water
in
the
opposite
field
they
could
see
the
brown
roof
and
walls
of
the
shelter
what
are
you
going
to
plant
in
the
seven
acres
field
barley
he
said
you
ca
it
was
barley
last
year
was
it
they
were
silent
then
jerrold
struggled
with
his
feeling
of
deadly
sickness
anne
could
trust
herself
to
speak
at
the
barrow
farm
gate
they
parted
ii
maisie
eyes
looked
at
him
across
the
table
wondering
her
little
drooping
mouth
was
half
open
with
anxiety
as
if
any
minute
she
was
going
to
say
something
the
had
shown
him
his
haggard
and
discoloured
face
a
face
to
frighten
her
he
tried
to
eat
but
the
sight
and
smell
of
hot
roast
mutton
sickened
him
oh
jerrold
ca
you
eat
it
no
i
ca
i
sorry
there
some
cold
chicken
will
you
have
that
no
thanks
try
and
eat
something
i
ca
i
feel
sick
do
sit
up
then
go
and
lie
down
i
will
if
you
do
mind
he
went
to
his
room
and
was
sick
he
lay
down
on
his
bed
and
tried
to
sleep
his
head
ached
violently
and
every
movement
made
him
heave
he
could
sleep
he
could
lie
still
and
presently
he
got
up
and
went
out
again
up
to
the
far
acres
field
to
the
ploughing
he
overcome
the
physical
sickness
of
his
misery
but
he
could
force
himself
to
move
to
tramp
up
and
down
the
stiff
furrows
watching
the
tractor
he
kept
himself
going
by
the
sheer
strength
of
his
will
the
rattle
and
clank
of
the
tractor
ground
into
his
head
making
it
ache
again
he
was
stunned
with
great
blows
of
noise
and
pain
so
that
he
could
think
he
did
want
to
think
he
was
glad
of
the
abominable
sensations
that
stopped
him
he
went
from
field
to
field
avoiding
the
boundaries
of
the
barrow
farm
lest
he
should
see
anne
when
the
sun
set
and
the
land
darkened
he
went
home
at
dinner
he
tried
to
eat
sickened
again
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
he
forced
himself
to
sit
through
the
meal
talking
to
maisie
when
it
was
over
he
went
to
bed
and
lay
awake
till
the
morning
the
next
day
passed
in
the
same
way
and
the
next
night
and
always
he
was
aware
of
maisie
sweet
face
watching
him
with
frightened
eyes
and
an
unuttered
question
he
was
afraid
to
tell
her
that
anne
was
going
lest
she
should
put
down
his
illness
to
its
true
cause
and
on
the
third
day
when
he
heard
her
say
she
was
going
to
see
anne
he
told
her
oh
jerrold
she
ca
really
mean
it
she
does
mean
it
i
said
everything
i
could
to
stop
her
but
it
any
good
she
taken
her
passage
but
why
should
she
want
to
go
i
ca
tell
you
why
you
better
ask
her
has
anything
happened
to
upset
her
what
on
earth
should
happen
oh
i
do
know
when
did
she
tell
you
this
he
hesitated
it
was
dangerous
to
lie
when
maisie
might
get
the
truth
from
anne
the
day
before
yesterday
maisie
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
considering
it
he
knew
she
was
saying
to
herself
that
was
the
day
you
came
home
so
sick
and
queer
jerry
did
you
say
anything
to
upset
her
no
i
ca
think
how
she
could
want
to
go
nor
i
but
she
going
i
shall
go
down
and
see
if
i
ca
make
her
stay
do
but
you
wo
if
i
ca
he
said
iii
maisie
went
down
early

since
she
would
never
see
jerrold
again
never
till
their
youth
was
gone
and
they
had
ceased
to
feel
iv
that
afternoon
eliot
arrived
at
wyck
manor
his
coming
was
his
answer
to
anne
letter
he
went
over
to
the
barrow
farm
about
five
when
anne
work
would
be
done
anne
was
still
out
and
he
waited
till
she
should
come
back
as
he
waited
he
looked
round
her
room
this
he
thought
was
the
place
that
anne
had
set
her
heart
on
having
for
her
own
it
was
the
home
they
had
made
for
her
something
terrible
must
have
happened
before
she
could
bring
herself
to
leave
it
she
must
have
been
driven
to
the
she
was
broken
jerrold
must
have
driven
and
broken
her
he
heard
her
feet
on
the
flagged
path
on
the
threshold
of
the
house
she
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
room
looking
at
him
startled
eliot
what
are
you
doing
there
waiting
for
you
you
must
have
known
i
come
to
say
that
was
nice
of

to
say
i
should
come
to

he
said
she
rang
the
bell
and
they
waited
she
gave
him
his
tea
and
while
they
ate
and
drank
he
talked
to
her
about
the
weather
and
the
land
and
about
his
work
and
the
book
he
had
just
finished
on
amoebic
dysentery
and
about
colin
and
how
well
he
was
now
neither
of
them
spoke
of
jerrold
or
of
maisie
when
the
tea
things
were
cleared
away
he
leaned
back
and
looked
at
her
with
his
kind
attentive
eyes
she
loved
eliot
eyes
and
his
queer
clever
face
that
was
so
like
and
so
unlike
his
father
so
utterly
unlike
jerrold
you
need
tell
me
why
you
going
he
said
at
last
i
seen
jerrold
did
he
tell
you
no
you
only
got
to
look
at
him
to
see
do
you
think
maisie
sees
i
ca
tell
you
she
is
stupid
she
must
wonder
why
you
going
like
this
i
told
her
i
told
her
i
was
in
love
with
jerrold
what
did
she
say
nothing
only
that
she
was
sorry
i
told
her
so
that
she
might
think
he
cared
for
me
she
need
know
that
she
is
stupid
he
said
again
no
but
she
good
she
trusts
him
so
she
trusted
me
eliot
that
was
the
worst
of
it
the
way
she
trusted
us
that
broke
us
down
of
course
she
trusted
you
did
you
you
know
i
did
and
yet
she
said
i
believe
you
knew
you
knew
all
the
time
if
i
did
i
know
now
everything
everything
how
because
of
my
going
away
is
that
it
not
altogether
i
seen
you
happy
and
i
seen
you
unhappy
seen
you
with
jerrold
i
seen
you
with
maisie
nobody
else
would
have
seen
it
but
i
did
because
i
knew
you
so
well
and
because
i
was
afraid
of
it
besides
you
almost
told
me
yes
and
you
said
it
would
make
any
difference
does
it
no
none
i
know
whatever
you
did
you
would
do
it
only
for
yourself
you
did
this
for
jerrold
and
you
were
unhappy
because
of
it
no
no
i
was
happy
we
were
only
unhappy
afterwards
because
of
maisie
it
was
so
awful
going
on
deceiving
her
hiding
it
and
lying
i
feel
as
if
everything
i
said
and
did
then
was
a
lie
that
was
how
i
was
punished
not
being
able
to
tell
the
truth
and
i
could
have
borne
even
that
if
it
was
for
jerrold
but
he
hated
it
too
it
made
him
wretched
i
know
it
did
if
you
had
been
so
fine
it
would
have
punished
you
horrible
thing
was
knowing
what
i
done
to
jerrold
making
him
hide
and
lie
oh
what
you
done
to
jerrold
you
done
him
nothing
but
good
you
made
him
finer
than
he
could
possibly
have
been
without
you
i
made
him
frightfully
unhappy
not
unhappier
than
he
made
you
and
it
what
he
had
to
be
i
told
you
long
ago
jerrold
would
be
any
good
till
he
suffered
damnably
well
he
has
suffered
damnably
and
he
got
a
soul
because
of
it
he
had
much
of
one
before
he
loved
you
how
do
you
mean
i
mean
he
used
to
think
of
nothing
but
his
own
happiness
now
thinking
of
nothing
but
maisie
and
yours
he
loves
you
better
than
himself
he
even
loves
maisie
better
i
mean
he
thinks
more
of
her
than
he
did
before
he
loved
you
there
are
two
people
that
he
cares
for
more
than
himself
he
cares
more
for
his
own
honour
than
he
did
and
for
yours
and
that
your
doing
just
think
how
you
have
wrecked
him
if
you
been
a
different
sort
of
woman
no
because
then
he
would
have
cared
for
me
no
i
believe
he
would
he
chose
well
you
were
always
much
too
good
to
me
no
anne
i
want
you
to
see
this
thing
straight
and
to
see
yourself
as
you
really
are
not
to
go
back
on
yourself
i
do
go
back
on
myself
that
would
be
going
back
on
jerrold
sorry
because
of
maisie
that
all
if
i
had
an
ounce
of
sense
never
have
known
her
i
have
gone
off
to
some
place
not
too
far
away
where
jerrold
could
have
come
to
me
and
where
i
should
never
have
seen
maisie
that
what
i
should
have
done
we
should
both
have
been
happy
then
yes
jerrold
would
have
been
happy
and
he
would
have
saved
his
soul
and
he
have
been
deceiving
maisie
all
the
time
you
do
really
wish
you
done
that
anne
no
not
now
and
i
not
unhappy
about
maisie
now
i
going
away
giving
jerrold
up
i
ca
do
more
than
that
you
would
have
to
go
away
anne
if
you
do
what
i
want
and
marry
me
you
said
perhaps
you
might
if
you
had
to
save
jerrold
did
i
i
do
think
i
did
you
forgotten
and
i
have
you
do
know
what
an
appalling
thing

of
sheer
unhappiness
nonsense
eliot

perfectly
well

die
of
unhappiness

die
of
accidents
and
diseases
and
old
age
i
shall
die
of
old
age

i
saved
myself
by
working

in
england
where

see
some
of
us
sometimes
but
out
there
with
people
you
never
saw
before
people
who
may
be
brutes
they
need
be
he
went
on
relentlessly
people
you
do
care
for
and
never
will
care
for
you
never
really
cared
for
anybody
but
us
i
have
i
going
because
i
care
i
ca
let
jerry
go
on
like
that
i
got
to
end
it
you
going
simply
to
save
jerrold
so
that
you
can
never
go
back
to
him
do
you
see
that
if
you
married
me
you
both
be
safe
you
could
go
back
if
you
were
married
to
me
jerrold
would
take
you
from
me
if
you
were
married
to
me
you
would
break
faith
with
me
if
you
had
children
you
would
break
faith
with
them
nothing
could
keep
you
safer
i
ca
eliot
nothing
changed
i
belong
to
jerrold
i
always
have
belonged
to
him
it
is
anything
physical
even
if
i
separated
from
him
thousands
of
miles
i
shall
belong
to
him
still
my
mind
or
soul
or
whatever
the
thing
is
ca
get
away
from
him
you
say
if
i
belonged
to
you
i
could
give
myself
to
jerrold
if
i
belong
to
jerrold
how
can
i
give
myself
to
you
i
see
it
like
that
is
it
it
like
that
eliot
said
no
more
he
knew
when
he
was
beaten
v
maisie
sat
alone
in
her
own
room
thinking
it
over
she
did
know
yet
that
eliot
had
come
he
had
arrived
while
she
was
with
anne
and
she
had
missed
him
on
the
way
to
barrow
farm
driving
up
by
the
hill
road
while
he
walked
down
through
the
fields
she
did
think
of
jerrold
all
at
once
her
mind
was
taken
up
with
anne
and
anne
unhappiness
she
could
see
nothing
else
she
remembered
how
adeline
had
told
her
that
anne
was
in
love
with
jerrold
she
had
said
it
was
funny
when
she
was
a
little
thing
anne
had
loved
him
all
her
life
then
all
her
life
she
had
had
to
do
without
him
maisie
thought
perhaps
he
would
have
loved
her
and
married
her
if
it
had
been
for
me
and
yet
anne
had
loved
her
that
was
anne
beauty
she
wondered
next
if
anne
had
been
in
love
with
jerrold
all
that
time
and
if
they
had
all
seen
it
all
the
fieldings
and
john
severn
how
was
it
that
she
had
never
seen
it
she
had
seen
nothing
but
a
perfect
friendship
and
she
had
tried
to
keep
it
for
them
in
all
its
perfection
so
that
neither
of
them
should
miss
anything
because
jerrold
had
married
her
she
remembered
how
happy
anne
had
been
when
she
first
knew
her
and
she
thought
if
she
was
happy
then
why
is
she
unhappy
now
if
she
loved
jerrold
all
her
life
if
she
had
done
without
him
all
her
life
why
go
away
now
unless
something
had
happened
it
was
then
that
maisie
thought
of
jerrold
and
his
sad
drawn
face
and
his
sudden
sickness
the
other
day
that
was
the
day
he
had
been
with
anne
when
she
had
told
him
that
she
was
going
away
he
had
never
been
the
same
since
he
had
neither
slept
nor
eaten
maisie
had
all
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
loose
before
her
and
at
first
sight
not
one
of
them
looked
as
if
it
would
fit
but
this
piece
under
her
hand
fitted
jerrold
illness
joined
on
to
anne
going
with
a
terrible
dread
in
her
heart
maisie
put
the
two
things
together
and
saw
the
third
thing
jerrold
was
ill
because
anne
was
going
away
he
would
be
ill
unless
he
cared
for
her
and
another
thing
anne
was
going
away
not
because
she
cared
but
because
jerrold
cared
therefore
she
knew
that
he
cared
for
her
therefore
he
had
told
her
that
was
what
had
happened
when
she
had
put
all
the
pieces
into
their
places
she
would
have
the
whole
story
but
maisie
did
want
to
know
any
more
she
had
enough
to
make
her
heart
break
she
still
clung
to
her
belief
in
their
goodness
they
were
unhappy
because
they
had
given
each
other
up
and
under
all
her
thinking
like
a
pain
there
went
her
premonition
of
its
end
she
remembered
that
they
had
been
happy
once
when
she
first
knew
them
if
they
were
unhappy
now
because
they
had
given
each
other
up
had
they
been
happy
then
because
they
had
for
a
moment
she
asked
herself
were
they
and
was
afraid
to
finish
and
answer
her
own
question
it
was
enough
that
they
were
all
unhappy
now
and
that
none
of
them
would
ever
be
happy
again
not
anne
not
jerrold
unhappiness
did
bear
thinking
of
and
in
thinking
of
it
maisie
forgot
her
own
her
heart
shook
her
breast
with
its
beating
and
for
a
moment
she
wondered
whether
her
pain
were
beginning
again
then
the
thought
of
anne
and
jerrold
and
herself
and
of
their
threefold
undivided
misery
came
upon
her
annihilating
every
other
thought
as
if
all
that
was
physical
in
maisie
were
subdued
by
the
intensity
of
her
suffering
with
the
coming
of
the
supreme
emotion
her
body
had
no
pain
xx
maisie
jerrold
and
anne
i
she
got
up
and
dressed
for
dinner
as
if
nothing
had
happened
or
rather
as
if
everything
were
about
to
happen
and
she
were
going
through
with
it
magnificently
with
no
sign
that
she
was
beaten
she
did
know
yet
what
she
would
do
she
did
see
clearly
what
there
was
to
be
done
she
might
not
have
to
do
anything
and
yet
again
vaguely
she
foresaw
that
she
might
be
called
on
to
do
something
something
that
was
hard
and
terrible
and
at
the
same
time
beautiful
and
supreme
and
downstairs
in
the
hall
she
found
eliot
he
told
her
that
he
had
come
down
to
see
anne
and
that
he
had
done
his
best
to
keep
her
from
going
away
and
that
it
was
all
no
good
we
ca
stop
her
she
got
an
unbreakable
will
unbreakable
she
said
and
yet
she
broken
i
know
he
said
in
her
nervous
exaltation
she
felt
that
eliot
had
been
sent
that
eliot
knew
eliot
was
wise
he
would
help
her
eliot
she
said

worrying

fretting
eliot
do
you
think
he
cares
for
her
eliot
did
answer
her
he
looked
at
her
gravely
searchingly
as
if
he
were
measuring
her
strength
before
he
answered
do
be
afraid
to
tell
me
i
not
a
coward
i
have
anything
to
tell
you
it
is
altogether
this
affair
of
anne
jerrold
has
been
fit
for
a
long
time
it
been
going
on
for
a
long
time
what
makes
you
think
so
oh
said
maisie
everything
then
why
do
you
ask
him
but
if
it
is
so

perhaps

wants
to
tell
you
only

afraid
anyhow
if
it
is
so
he
tell
you
and
you
be
happy
somehow
i
do
think
i
going
to
be
happy
then
he
said
you
going
to
be
brave
she
thought
he
knows
he
known
all
the
time
only
he
wo
give
them
away
yes
she
said
i
ask
him
maisie
if
it
is
so
what
will
you
do
do
there
only
one
thing
i
do
she
turned
to
him
and
her
face
was
ashen
the
skin
had
a
slack
pitted
look
suddenly
old
the
soft
flesh
trembled
but
her
mouth
and
eyes
were
still
in
this
moment
of
her
agony
no
base
emotion
defaced
their
sweetness
so
that
she
seemed
to
him
utterly
composed
she
had
seen
what
she
could
do
something
hard
and
terrible
i
can
set
him
free
ii
that
was
the
end
she
had
seen
before
her
vaguely
as
something
not
only
hard
and
terrible
but
beautiful
and
supreme
to
leave
off
clinging
to
the
illusion
of
her
happiness
to
let
go
and
with
that
letting
go
she
was
aware
that
an
obscure
horror
had
been
hanging
over
her
for
three
days
and
three
nights
and
was
now
gone
she
stood
free
of
herself
in
a
great
light
and
peace
so
that
presently
when
jerrold
came
to
her
she
met
him
with
an
incomparable
tranquillity
jerrold
the
slight
throbbing
of
her
voice
startled
him
coming
out
of
her
stillness
they
stood
up
facing
each
other
in
attitudes
that
had
no
permanence
as
if
what
must
pass
between
them
now
would
be
sudden
and
soon
over
do
you
care
for
anne
the
words
dropped
clear
through
her
stillness
vibrating
his
eyes
went
from
her
evading
the
issue
her
voice
came
with
a
sharper
stress
i
know
you
care
for
her
yes
and
that
why
she
going
yes
that
why
she
going
did
eliot
say
anything
no
he
only
told
me
to
ask
you
he
said
you
tell
me
the
truth
i
have
told
you
the
truth
i
sorry
maisie
i
know
you
sorry
so
am
i
but
you
see
it
is
as
if
i
begun
after
i
married
you
i
cared
for
her
all
my
life
then
why
did
you
marry
her
because
first
of
all
i
did
know
i
cared
and
afterwards
i
thought
she
cared
for
colin
you
never
asked
her
no
i
thought
i
thought
they
were
lovers
you
thought
that
of
her
well
yes
i
thought
it
would
be
just
like
her
to
give
everything
i
knew
if
she
cared
enough
she
stick
at
nothing
she
would
do
it
for
herself
that
was
when
the
time
i
came
home
on
leave
three
years
ago
the
time
you
married
me
why
did
you
marry
me
if
you
did
care
for
me
i
would
have
cared
for
you
if
i
had
cared
for
her
but
when
you
cared
for
her
i
thought
we
should
find
something
in
it
i
wanted
you
to
be
happy
more
than
anything
i
wanted
you
to
be
happy
i
thought
i
be
killed
in
my
next
action
and
that
nothing
would
matter
that
you
would
have
to
keep
it
up
oh
i
have
kept
it
up
all
right
if
anne
had
been
there
i
cared
enough
for
you
to
want
you
to
be
happy
i
wanted
you
to
have
a
child
you
have
liked
that
that
would
have
made
you
happy
poor
jerrold
i
have
been
all
right
if
i
had
seen
anne
again
when
did
you
see
her
again
last
spring
only
last
spring
yes
only
when
i
was
away
she
remembered
she
remembered
how
she
had
first
come
to
wyck
and
found
jerrold
happy
and
superbly
well
but
she
said
you
were
happy
then
he
sighed
a
long
tearing
sigh
that
hurt
her
yes
we
were
happy
then
and
in
a
flash
of
terrific
clarity
she
remembered
her
and
the
night
that
followed
it
and
jerrold
acquiescence
in
their
separation
then
she
said
if
you
were
happy
do
you
want
to
know
how
far
it
went
i
want
to
know
everything
i
want
the
truth
i
think
you
owe
me
the
truth
it
went
just
as
far
as
it
could
go
do
you
mean
he
stood
silent
and
she
found
his
words
for
him
you
were
anne
lover
yes
her
face
changed
before
him
as
it
had
changed
an
hour
ago
before
eliot
and
slack
quivering
suddenly
old
tears
came
into
his
eyes
tears
of
remorse
and
pity
she
saw
them
and
her
heart
ached
for
him
it
did
last
long
he
said
how
long
from
march
till
till
september
i
remember
maisie
i
ca
ask
you
to
forgive
me
but
you
must
forgive
anne
it
was
her
fault
i
made
her
do
it
and
she
been
awfully
unhappy
about
it
because
of
you
ah
that
was
why
wo
you
forgive
her
i
forgive
you
both
i
do
know
how
i
should
have
felt
if
you
been
happy
i
ca
see
anything
but
your
unhappiness
we
gave
it
up
because
of
you
that
was
anne
she
could
bear
going
on
after
she
knew
you
when
you
were
such
an
angel
it
was
your
goodness
and
sweetness
broke
us
down
but
if
i
been
the
most
disagreeable
person
it
would
have
been
just
as
it
would
for
in
that
case
we
should
have
deceived
you
i
should
have
told
you
straight
and
left
you
why
did
you
tell
me
jerrold
why
did
you
tell
me
in
the
beginning
we
were
afraid
we
did
want
to
hurt
you
as
if
that
mattered
it
did
matter
we
were
going
to
tell
you
then
you
were
ill
and
we
could
we
thought
you
die
of
it
with
your
poor
little
heart
in
that
state
oh
my
dear
did
you
suppose
i
hurt
you
that
way
that
was
what
we
could
bear
not
being
straight
about
it
that
was
why
we
gave
each
other
up
it
never
happened
again
anne
going
away
so
that
it
may
happen
maisie
you
believe
me
yes
i
believe
you
i
believe
you
did
all
you
knew
we
did
but
it
my
fault
that
anne
going
i
lost
my
head
and
she
was
afraid
if
only
you
told
me
i
should
have
been
hard
on
you
jerry
you
knew
that
did
you
yes
i
knew
and
you
went
through
all
that
agony
rather
than
hurt
me
yes
the
least
i
can
do
then
is
to
let
you
go
would
you
maisie
of
course
i
married
you
to
make
you
happy
i
must
make
you
happy
this
way
that
all
but
if
i
do
you
must
think
i
do
care
for
you
i
care
for
you
so
much
that
nothing
matters
but
your
happiness
maisie
i
not
fit
to
live
in
the
same
world
with
you
you
must
say
that
you
fit
to
live
in
the
same
world
with
anne
i
suppose
i
could
have
made
this
all
ugly
and
shameful
for
you
but
i
want
to
keep
it
beautiful
i
want
to
give
you
all
beautiful
to
anne
so
that
you
never
go
back
on
it
and
never
feel
ashamed
you
made
me
ashamed
every
time
we
thought
of
you
do
think
of
me
think
of
each
other
oh
you
adorable
no
i
doing
this
because
i
love
you
both
but
if
i
did
love
you
i
should
do
it
for
myself
i
should
hate
myself
if
i
did
i
ca
think
of
anything
more
disgusting
and
dishonourable
than
to
keep
a
man
tied
to
you
when
he
cares
for
somebody
else
i
should
feel
as
if
i
were
living
in
sin
maisie
will
you
be
awfully
unhappy
yes
jerrold
but
not
so
unhappy
as
if

it
up
that
way
i
was
dreaming
of
making
it
up
i
simply
owe
you
everything
everlastingly
and
there
nothing
i
can
do
i
only
remembered
that
you
liked
the
garden

bear
it

hate
the
garden

should
hate
the
whole
place

that
to
me

helped
but
what
will

i
shall
go
back
to
my
own
people
they
happen
to
care
for
me
that
was
her
one
reproach
do
you
think
do
oh
no
i
done
the
only
thing
that
would
make
you
care
perhaps
that
what
i
did
it
for
he
took
the
hand
she
gave
him
and
bowed
his
head
over
it
and
kissed
it
iii
maisie
had
a
long
talk
with
eliot
after
jerrold
had
left
her
she
was
still
tranquil
and
composed
but
jerrold
was
worried
he
was
afraid
lest
the
emotion
roused
by
his
confession
should
bring
on
her
pain
that
night
eliot
slept
in
his
father
room
so
that
he
could
go
to
her
if
the
attack
came
but
it
did
not
come
late
in
the
afternoon
jerrold
went
down
to
the
barrow
farm
and
saw
anne
he
came
back
with
a
message
from
her
anne
wanted
to
see
maisie
if
maisie
would
let
her
but
she
thinks
you
wo
he
said
why
should
i
she
desperately
unhappy
she
turned
from
him
as
if
she
would
have
left
him
and
then
stayed
you
want
me
to
see
her
if
you
would
hate
it
too
much
i
shall
hate
it
but
i
see
her
go
and
bring
her
she
dreaded
more
than
anything
the
sight
of
anne
her
new
knowledge
of
her
made
anne
strange
and
terrible
she
felt
that
she
would
be
somehow
different
she
would
see
something
in
her
that
she
had
never
seen
before
that
she
could
bear
to
see
anne
face
would
show
her
that
jerrold
was
her
lover
yet
if
she
had
never
seen
that
look
if
she
had
never
seen
anything
in
anne
face
that
was
not
beautiful
what
did
that
mean
but
that
love
for
him
was
beautiful
before
it
had
touched
her
body
it
had
lived
a
long
time
in
her
soul
either
anne
soul
was
beautiful
because
of
it
or
it
was
beautiful
because
of
anne
soul
and
maisie
knew
that
if
she
too
was
to
be
beautiful
she
must
keep
safe
the
beauty
of
their
passion
as
she
had
kept
safe
the
beauty
of
their
friendship
it
was
clear
and
hard
unbreakable
as
crystal
had
been
the
one
flaw
in
it
the
thing
that
had
damaged
its
perfection
now
that
she
had
let
jerrold
go
it
would
be
perfect
anne
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
library
looking
at
her
and
not
speaking
she
was
the
same
that
she
had
been
yesterday
and
before
that
and
before
that
dressed
in
the
farm
clothes
that
were
the
queer
rough
setting
of
her
charm
the
same
except
that
she
was
still
more
broken
still
more
beaten
and
still
more
beautiful
in
her
defeat
anne
maisie
got
up
and
waited
as
anne
shut
the
door
and
stood
there
with
her
back
to
it
maisie
i
do
know
why
i
come
there
were
things
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
but
i
ca
say
them
you
want
to
say
you
sorry
you
took
jerrold
from
me
i
bitterly
sorry
she
came
forward
with
a
slender
awkward
grace
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
maisie
thrown
open
expecting
pain
but
she
did
shrink
or
cower
maisie
voice
came
with
its
old
sweetness
you
did
take
him
from
me
you
could
take
what
i
have
got
i
gave
him
up
maisie
i
could
bear
it
and
i
given
him
up
could
bear
it
either
but
she
said
it
was
harder
for
you
you
had
him
i
only
giving
up
what
i
never
really
had
do
be
too
unhappy
about
it
i
shall
always
be
unhappy
when
i
think
of
you
you
been
such
an
angel
to
me
if
we
could
only
have
told
you
yes
if
only
you
told
me
that
was
where
you
went
wrong
anne
i
could
tell
you
you
were
so
ill
i
thought
it
would
kill
you
well
what
if
it
had
you
should
have
thought
of
me
you
should
have
thought
of
jerrold
i
did
think
of
him
i
did
want
him
to
have
agonies
of
remorse
been
bad
enough
as
it
is
i
know
what
it
been
anne
that
what
i
really
came
for
now
to
see
if
you
had
that
pain
again
you
need
be
afraid
i
shall
never
have
that
pain
again
eliot
told
me
all
about
it
last
night
what
did
he
say
he
showed
me
how
it
all
happened
i
was
ill
because
i
could
face
the
truth
the
truth
was
that
jerrold
did
care
for
me
it
seems
my
mind
knew
it
all
the
time
when
i
did
i
did
know
it
once
and
part
of
me
went
on
feeling
the
shock
of
it
while
the
other
part
was
living
like
a
fool
in
an
illusion
thinking
he
cared
and
now
i
been
dragged
out
of
it
into
reality
i
facing
it
is
real
and
whatever
i
may
be
i
sha
be
ill
again
not
with
that
illness
i
could
help
it
but
in
a
way
it
was
as
false
as
if
i
made
it
up
on
purpose
to
hide
the
truth
and
the
truth
cured
me
eliot
told
me
it
might
and
i
would
believe
him
you
can
believe
him
now
he
said
you
and
jerrold
were
all
right
because
you
faced
the
truth
about
yourselves
and
each
other
you
held
on
to
reality
eliot
said
that
yes
he
said
it
was
the
test
of
everybody
how
they
took
reality
and
that
jerrold
had
had
to
learn
how
but
that
you
had
always
known
you
were
so
true
that
your
worst
punishment
was
not
being
able
to
tell
me
the
truth
i
was
to
think
of
you
like
that
how
can
you
bear
to
think
of
me
at
all
how
can
i
bear
to
live
but
i
shall
live
maisie
voice
dropped
note
by
note
like
clear
rounded
tears
pressed
out
and
shaped
by
pain
anne
voice
came
thick
and
quivering
out
of
her
dark
secret
anguish
like
a
voice
from
behind
shut
doors
jerrold
said
you
forgiven
me
have
you
it
would
be
easier
for
you
if
i
did
but
i
ca
help
forgiving
you
when
you
so
unhappy
i
would
have
forgiven
you
if
you
had
told
me
the
truth
if
i
had
to
find
it
out
that
time
when
you
were
happy
then
i
have
hated
you
you
do
now
no
i
do
want
to
see
you
again
or
jerrold
either
for
a
long
time
but
that
because
i
love
you
yes
you
too
anne
how
you
love
me
because
i
like
you
anne
i
faithful
i
was
faithful
to
you
maisie
you
were
to
jerrold
anne
still
stood
there
silent
taking
in
silence
the
pain
of
goodness
maisie
love
then
maisie
ended
it
he
waiting
for
you
she
said
to
take
you
home
anne
went
to
him
where
he
stood
by
the
terrace
steps
illuminated
by
the
light
from
the
windows
in
there
she
could
hear
colin
playing
a
loud
tempestuous
music
jerrold
waited
she
went
past
him
down
the
steps
without
a
word
and
he
followed
her
through
the
garden
anne
he
said
under
the
blackness
of
the

safe
and

of
