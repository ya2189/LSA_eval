chapter
i
miriam
sat
in
her
lowly
cabin
painfully
rocking
her
body
to
and
fro
for
a
great
sorrow
had
fallen
upon
her
life
she
had
been
the
mother
of
three
children
two
had
died
in
their
infancy
and
now
her
last
her
loved
and
only
child
was
gone
but
not
like
the
rest
who
had
passed
away
almost
as
soon
as
their
little
feet
had
touched
the
threshold
of
existence
she
had
been
entangled
in
the
mazes
of
sin
and
sorrow
and
her
sun
had
gone
down
in
darkness
it
was
the
old
story
agnes
fair
young
and
beautiful
had
been
a
slave
with
no
power
to
protect
herself
from
the
highest
insults
that
brutality
could
offer
to
innocence
bound
hand
and
foot
by
that
system
which
has
since
gone
down
in
wrath
and
blood
and
tears
she
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
wiles
and
power
of
her
master
and
the
result
was
the
introduction
of
a
child
of
shame
into
a
world
of
sin
and
suffering
for
herself
an
early
grave
and
for
her
mother
a
desolate
and
breaking
heart
while
miriam
was
sitting
down
hopelessly
beneath
the
shadow
of
her
mighty
grief
gazing
ever
and
anon
on
the
pale
dead
face
which
seemed
to
bear
in
its
sad
but
gentle
expression
an
appeal
from
earth
to
heaven
some
of
the
slaves
would
hurry
in
and
looking
upon
the
fair
young
face
would
drop
a
word
of
pity
for
the
weeping
mother
and
then
hurry
on
to
their
appointed
tasks
all
day
long
miriam
sat
alone
with
her
dead
except
when
these
kindly
interruptions
broke
upon
the
monotony
of
her
sorrow
in
the
afternoon
camilla
the
only
daughter
of
her
master
entered
her
cabin
and
throwing
her
arms
around
her
neck
exclaimed
oh
mammy
i
am
so
sorry
i
did
know
agnes
was
dead
i
been
on
a
visit
to
mr
le
grange
plantation
and
i
just
got
back
this
afternoon
and
as
soon
as
i
heard
that
agnes
was
dead
i
hurried
to
see
you
i
would
not
even
wait
for
my
dinner
oh
how
sweet
she
looks
said
camilla
bending
over
the
corpse
just
as
natural
as
life
when
did
she
die
this
morning
my
poor
dear
darling
and
another
burst
of
anguish
relieved
the
overcharged
heart
oh
mammy
do
cry
i
am
so
sorry
but
what
is
this
said
she
as
the
little
bundle
of
flannel
began
to
stir
that
is
poor
agnes
baby
agnes
baby
why
i
did
know
that
agnes
had
a
baby
do
let
me
see
it
tenderly
the
grandmother
unfolded
the
wrappings
and
presented
the
little
stranger
he
was
a
beautiful
babe
whose
golden
hair
bright
blue
eyes
and
fair
complexion
showed
no
trace
of
the
outcast
blood
in
his
veins
oh
how
beautiful
said
camilla
surely
this
ca
be
agnes
baby
he
is
just
as
white
as
i
am
and
his
eyes
what
a
beautiful
blue
and
his
hair
why
it
is
really
lovely
he
is
very
pretty
miss
but
after
all
he
is
only
a
slave
a
slave
she
had
heard
that
word
before
but
somehow
when
applied
to
that
fair
child
it
grated
harshly
on
her
ear
and
she
said
well
i
think
it
is
a
shame
for
him
to
be
a
slave
when
he
is
just
as
white
as
anybody
now
mammy
said
she
throwing
off
her
hat
and
looking
soberly
into
the
fire
if
i
had
my
way
he
should
never
be
a
slave
and
why
ca
you
have
your
way
i
sure
master
humors
you
in
everything
i
know
that
pa
does
everything
i
wish
him
to
do
but
i
do
know
how
i
could
manage
about
this
if
his
mother
were
living
i
would
beg
pa
to
set
them
both
free
and
send
them
north
but
his
mother
is
gone
and
mammy
we
could
spare
you
and
besides
it
is
so
cold
in
the
north
you
would
freeze
to
death
and
yet
i
ca
bear
the
thought
of
his
being
a
slave
i
wonder
said
she
musing
to
herself
i
wonder
if
i
could
save
him
from
being
a
slave
now
i
have
it
she
said
rising
hastily
her
face
aglow
with
pleasurable
excitement
i
was
reading
yesterday
a
beautiful
story
in
the
bible
about
a
wicked
king
who
wanted
to
kill
all
the
little
boys
of
a
people
who
were
enslaved
in
his
land
and
how
his
mother
hid
her
child
by
the
side
of
a
river
and
that
the
king
daughter
found
him
and
saved
his
life
it
was
a
fine
story
and
i
read
it
till
i
cried
now
i
mean
to
do
something
like
that
good
princess
i
am
going
to
ask
pa
to
let
me
take
him
to
the
house
and
have
a
nurse
for
him
and
bring
him
up
like
a
white
child
and
never
let
him
know
that
he
is
colored
miriam
shook
her
head
doubtfully
and
camilla
looking
disappointed
said
do
you
like
my
plan
laws
honey
it
would
be
fustrate
but
your
pa
would
hear
to
it
yes

set
my
heart
upon
it
and
wo
be
satisfied
if
he
do
consent
i
know
if
i
set
my
heart
upon
it
he
wo

me
fret
why
mammy
he
bought
me
two
thousand
dollars
worth
of
jewelry
when

a
fancy
to

diamond
set

saw
at
tiffany

i
am
going
to
ask

eager
and
anxious
to

out
her
plan
camilla
left
the
cabin
to
find
her
father
he
was
seated
in
his
library
reading
homer
he
looked
up
as
her
light
step
fell
upon
the
threshold
and
said
playfully
what
is
your
wish
my
princess

me
if
it
is
the
half
of
my
kingdom
encouraged
by
his
manner

knee
and
said

so
before
i
got
my
dinner
i
hastened
to
mammy
cabin
and
found
poor
mammy
almost
and
agnes
lying
dead
but
looking
just
as
natural
as
life
she
was
dead
but
had
left
one
of
the
dearest
little
babies
i
ever
saw
why
pa
he
is
just
as
white
as
we
are
and
i
told
mammy
so
but
she
said
it
did
matter

a
poor
slave
just
like
the
rest
of
us
now
pa
i
do
want
agnes
baby
to
be
a
slave
ca
you
keep
him
from
growing
up
a
slave
how
am
i
to
do
that
my
little
abolitionist
no
pa
i
am
not
an
abolitionist
i
heard
some
of
them
talk
when
i
was
in
new
york
and
i
think
they
are
horrid
creatures
but
pa
this
child
is
so
white
nobody
would
ever
know
that
he
had
one
drop
of
negro
blood
in
his
veins
could
we
take
him
out
of
that
cabin
and
make
all
the
servants
promise
that
they
would
never
breathe
a
word
about
his
being
colored
and
let
me
bring
him
up
as
a
white
child
well
said
mr
le
croix
bursting
into
a
hearty
laugh
that
is
a
capital
joke
my
little
dewdrop
talk
of
bringing
up
a
child
why
darling
you
would
tire
of
him
in
a
week
oh
no
pa
i
would
just
try
me
if
it
is
only
for
a
week
why
sunbeam
it
is
impossible
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
a
negro
being
palmed
upon
society
as
a
white
person
negro
pa
he
is
just
as
white
as
you
are
and
his
eyes
are
as
blue
as
mine
still
he
belongs
to
the
negro
race
and
one
drop
of
that
blood
in
his
veins
curses
all
the
rest
i
would
grant
you
anything
in
reason
but
this
is
not
to
be
thought
of
were
i
to
do
so
i
would
immediately
lose
caste
among
all
the
planters
in
the
neighborhood
i
would
be
set
down
as
an
abolitionist
and
singled
out
for
insult
and
injury
ask
me
anything
camilla
but
that
oh
pa
what
do
you
care
about
social
position
you
never
hunt
nor
entertain
company
nor
take
any
part
in
politics
you
shut
yourself
up
in
your
library
year
after
year
and
pore
over
your
musty
books
and
hardly
any
one
knows
whether
you
are
dead
or
alive
and
i
am
sure
that
we
could
hide
the
secret
of
his
birth
and
pass
him
off
as
the
orphan
child
of
one
of
our
friends
and
that
will
be
the
truth
for
agnes
was
our
friend
at
least
i
know
she
was
mine
well
i
see
about
it
now
get
down
and
let
me
finish
reading
this
chapter
the
next
day
camilla
went
again
to
the
cabin
of
miriam
but
the
overseer
had
set
her
to
a
task
in
the
field
and
agnes
baby
was
left
to
the
care
of
an
aged
woman
who
was
too
old
to
work
in
the
fields
but
not
being
entirely
past
service
she
was
appointed
as
one
of
the
nurses
for
the
babies
and
young
children
while
their
mothers
were
working
in
the
fields
camilla
feeling
an
unusual
interest
in
the
child
went
to
the
overseer
and
demanded
that
miriam
should
be
released
from
her
tasks
and
permitted
to
attend
the
child
in
vain
the
overseer
plead
the
pressure
for
hands
and
the
busy
season
camilla
said
it
did
not
matter
she
wanted
miriam
and
she
would
have
her
and
he
feeling
that
it
was
to
his
interest
to
please
the
little
lady
had
miriam
sent
from
the
field
to
camilla
mammy
i
want
you
to
come
to
the
house
i
want
you
to
come
and
be
my
mammy
agnes
is
dead
your
husband
is
gone
and
i
want
you
to
come
and
bring
the
baby
to
the
house
and
i
am
going
to
get
him
some
beautiful
dresses
and
some
lovely
coral
i
saw
in
new
orleans
and
i
am
going
to
dress
him
so
handsomely
that
i
believe
pa
will
feel
just
as
i
do
and
think
it
a
shame
that
such
a
beautiful
child
should
be
a
slave
camilla
went
home
and
told
her
father
what
she
had
done
and
he
willing
to
compromise
with
her
readily
consented
and
in
a
day
or
two
the
child
and
his
grandmother
were
comfortably
ensconced
in
their
new
quarters
the
winter
passed
the
weeks
ripened
into
months
and
the
months
into
years
and
the
child
under
the
pleasant
dispensations
of
love
and
kindness
grew
to
be
a
fine
healthy
and
handsome
boy
one
day
when
mr
le
croix
was
in
one
of
his
most
genial
moods
camilla
again
introduced
the
subject
which
she
had
concealed
but
not
abandoned
now
father
i
do
think
it
is
a
shame
for
this
child
to
be
a
slave
when
he
is
just
as
white
as
anybody
i
am
sure
we
could
move
away
from
here
to
france
and
you
could
adopt
him
as
your
son
and
no
one
would
know
anything
of
his
birth
and
parentage
he
is
so
beautiful
i
would
like
him
for
my
brother
and
he
looks
like
us
anyhow
le
croix
flushed
deep
at
these
words
and
he
looked
keenly
into
his
daughter
face
but
her
gaze
was
so
open
her
expression
so
frank
and
artless
he
could
not
think
that
her
words
had
any
covert
meaning
in
reference
to
the
paternity
of
the
child
but
to
save
that
child
from
being
a
slave
and
to
hide
his
origin
was
with
her
a
pet
scheme
and
to
use
her
own
words
she
had
set
her
heart
upon
it
chapter
ii
bernard
le
croix
was
the
only
son
of
a
spanish
lady
and
a
french
gentleman
who
were
married
in
hayti
a
few
months
before
the
revolution
which
gave
freedom
to
the
island
and
made
hayti
an
independent
nation
his
father
foreseeing
the
storm
which
was
overshadowing
the
land
contrived
to
escape
bringing
with
him
a
large
amount
of
personal
property
and
preferring
a
climate
similar
to
his
own
he
bought
a
plantation
on
red
river
and
largely
stocked
it
with
slaves
only
one
child
blessed
their
union
bernard
le
croix
who
grew
up
sensitive
shy
and
retiring
with
a
taste
for
solitude
and
literary
pursuits
during
the
troubles
in
hayti
his
uncle
and
only
daughter
escaped
from
the
island
leaving
every
thing
behind
except
the
clothing
upon
their
persons
and
a
few
jewels
they
had
hastily
collected
broken
in
spirits
feeble
in
health
louis
le
croix
reached
louisiana
only
to
die
in
his
brother
arms
and
to
leave
his
orphan
daughter
to
his
care
she
was
about
ten
years
old
and
bernard
was
twelve
and
in
their
childhood
was
commenced
a
friendship
which
ripened
into
love
and
marriage
father
and
mother
lived
long
enough
to
see
their
first
and
only
grandchild
and
then
died
leaving
their
son
a
large
baronial
estate
slaves
and
a
vast
amount
of
money
passionately
fond
of
literature
aesthetic
in
his
tastes
he
devoted
himself
to
poetry
and
the
ancient
classics
filled
his
home
with
the
finest
paintings
and
the
most
beautiful
statuary
and
had
his
gardens
laid
out
in
the
most
exquisite
manner
and
into
that
beautiful
home
he
brought
his
young
and
lovely
bride
but
in
that
fair
house
where
velvet
carpets
hushed
her
tread
and
magnificence
surrounded
her
path
she
drooped
and
faded
day
by
day
her
cheek
grew
paler
her
footsteps
slower
until
she
passed
away
like
a
thing
of
love
and
light
and
left
her
husband
and
a
child
of
six
summers
to
mourn
her
loss
bernard
ever
shy
and
sensitive
grew
more
so
after
the
death
of
his
wife
he
sought
no
society
seemed
to
lose
all
interest
in
politics
and
secluded
himself
in
his
library
till
he
had
almost
passed
from
the
recollection
of
his
nearest
neighbors
he
superintended
the
education
of
his
daughter
because
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
being
separated
from
her
and
she
seeing
very
little
of
society
and
reading
only
from
the
best
authors
both
ancient
and
modern
was
growing
up
with
very
little
knowledge
of
the
world
except
what
she
learned
from
books
without
any
female
relatives
to
guide
her
she
had
no
other
associates
than
the
servants
of
her
household
and
the
family
of
mr
le
grange
her
mother
nurse
and
favorite
servant
had
taken
the
charge
of
her
after
her
death
and
agnes
had
been
her
nurse
and
companion
camilla
although
adored
and
petted
by
every
one
and
knowing
no
law
but
her
own
will
was
still
a
very
lovely
child
her
father
wrapped
in
his
literary
pursuits
had
left
the
entire
control
of
his
plantation
to
overseers
in
whom
he
trusted
almost
implicitly
and
many
a
tale
of
wrong
and
sorrow
came
to
the
ear
of
camilla
for
these
people
had
learned
to
love
her
and
to
trust
in
her
as
an
angel
of
mercy
often
would
she
interfere
in
their
behalf
and
tell
the
story
of
their
wrongs
to
her
father
and
at
her
instance
more
than
one
overseer
had
been
turned
away
which
coming
to
the
ears
of
others
made
them
cautious
how
they
offended
the
little
lady
for
young
as
she
was
they
soon
learned
that
she
had
great
influence
with
her
father
who
would
comply
with
almost
any
fancy
or
request
rather
than
see
her
unhappy
or
fretting
and
camilla
knowing
her
power
insisted
that
agnes
child
should
be
raised
as
a
white
child
and
the
secret
of
his
birth
effectually
concealed
at
first
mr
le
croix
thought
it
was
a
passing
whim
that
she
would
soon
forget
that
the
child
would
amuse
and
interest
her
for
awhile
and
then
she
would
tire
of
him
as
she
had
of
other
things
such
as
her
birds
her
squirrel
and
even
her
shetland
pony
but
when
he
found
that
instead
of
her
intention
being
a
passing
whim
it
was
a
settled
purpose
he
made
up
his
mind
to
accede
to
her
wishes
his
plan
was
to
take
the
child
north
to
have
him
educated
and
then
adopt
him
as
his
son
and
in
fact
the
plan
rather
suited
him
for
then
he
could
care
for
him
as
a
son
without
acknowledging
the
relationship
and
being
a
member
of
two
nations
having
a
latin
basis
he
did
not
feel
the
same
pride
of
race
and
contempt
and
repulsion
for
weaker
races
which
characterizes
the
proud
and
imperious
the
next
summer
mr
le
croix
took
a
journey
to
the
north
taking
louis
and
camilla
with
him
he
found
a
very
pleasant
family
school
in
new
england
and
having
made
suitable
arrangements
he
left
louis
in
the
care
of
the
matron
whose
kindness
and
attentions
soon
won
the
heart
and
before
he
left
the
north
louis
seemed
perfectly
contented
with
his
new
home
camilla
was
delighted
with
her
tour
the
constant
companion
of
her
father
she
visited
with
him
every
place
of
amusement
or
interest
they
could
find
she
was
much
pleased
with
the
factories
and
watched
with
curious
eyes
the
intelligent
faces
of
the
operatives
as
they
plied
with
ready
fingers
their
daily
tasks
sometimes
she
would
contrast
their
appearance
with
the
laborers
she
had
seen
wending
their
way
into
their
lowly
huts
and
then
her
face
would
grow
sober
even
to
sadness
a
puzzled
expression
would
flit
over
her
countenance
as
if
she
were
trying
to
solve
a
problem
which
was
inexplicable
to
her
one
day
on
the
hunt
for
some
new
excitement
her
father
passed
down
tremont
and
saw
advertised
in
large
letters
on
the
entrance
to
tremont
temple
anti
slavery
meeting
and
never
having
been
in
such
a
place
before
he
entered
impelled
by
a
natural
curiosity
to
hear
what
could
be
said
against
a
system
in
which
he
had
been
involved
from
his
earliest
recollections
without
taking
the
pains
to
examine
it
the
first
speaker
was
a
colored
man
this
rather
surprised
him
he
had
been
accustomed
to
colored
men
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
as
such
he
had
known
some
of
them
to
be
intelligent
shrewd
and
wide
awake
but
this
was
a
new
experience
the
man
had
been
a
slave
and
recounted
in
burning
words
the
wrongs
which
had
been
heaped
upon
him
he
told
that
he
had
been
a
husband
and
a
father
that
his
wife
had
possessed
for
a
slave
the
fatal
gift
of
beauty
that
a
trader
from
whose
presence
her
soul
had
recoiled
with
loathing
had
marked
her
as
his
prey
then
he
told
how
he
had
knelt
at
his
master
feet
and
implored
him
not
to
sell
her
but
it
was
all
in
vain
the
trader
was
rich
in
gold
and
he
was
poor
and
weak
he
next
attempted
to
describe
his
feelings
when
he
saw
his
wife
and
children
standing
on
the
auction
block
and
heard
the
coarse
jests
of
the
spectators
and
the
fierce
competition
of
the
bidders
the
speaker
made
a
deep
impression
upon
the
minds
of
the
audience
and
even
le
croix
who
had
been
accustomed
to
slavery
all
his
life
felt
a
sense
of
guilt
passing
over
him
for
his
complicity
in
the
system
whilst
camilla
grew
red
and
pale
by
turns
and
clutching
her
little
hands
nervously
together
said
father
let
us
go
home
le
croix
saw
the
deep
emotion
on
his
daughter
face
and
the
nervous
twitchings
of
her
lips
and
regretted
that
he
had
introduced
her
to
such
an
exciting
scene
when
they
were
seated
in
their
private
parlor
le
croix
said
birdie
i
am
sorry
that
we
attended
that
meeting
this
morning
i
did
believe
a
word
that
nigger
said
and
yet
these
people
all
drank
it
down
as
if
every
word
were
gospel
truth
they
are
a
set
of
fanatics
calculated
to
keep
the
nation
in
hot
water
i
hope
that
you
will
never
enter
such
a
place
again
did
you
believe
one
word
that
negro
said
why
yes
pa
i
did
because
our
isaac
used
to
tell
me
just
such
a
story
as
that
if
i
had
shut
my
eyes
i
could
have
imagined
that
it
was
isaac
telling
his
story
isaac
what
business
had
isaac
telling
you
any
such
stories
oh
pa
do
get
angry
with
isaac
it
was
his
fault
it
was
mine
you
know
when
you
brought
him
home
to
drive
the
carriage
he
used
to
look
so
sorrowful
and
i
said
to
him
one
day
isaac
what
makes
you
so
sad
why
do
you
laugh
and
talk
like
jerry
and
sam
and
he
said
missus
i
ca
ise
got
a
mighty
heap
of
trouble
on
my
mind
and
he
looked
so
when
he
said
this
i
wanted
to
know
what
was
the
matter
but
he
said
wo
do
for
a
little
lady
like
you
to
know
the
troubles
of
we
poor
creatures
but
one
day
when
sam
came
home
from
new
orleans
he
brought
him
a
letter
from
his
wife
and
he
really
seemed
to
be
overjoyed
and
he
kissed
the
letter
and
put
it
in
his
bosom
and
i
never
saw
him
look
half
so
happy
before
so
the
next
day
when
i
asked
him
to
get
the
pony
ready
he
asked
me
if
i
would
read
it
for
him
he
said
he
had
been
trying
to
make
it
out
but
somehow
he
could
not
get
the
hang
of
the
words
and
so
i
sat
down
and
read
it
to
him
then
he
told
me
about
his
wife
how
beautiful
she
was
and
how
a
trader
a
real
mean
man
wanted
to
buy
her
and
that
he
had
begged
his
master
not
to
sell
her
but
it
was
no
use
she
had
to
go
but
he
was
glad
of
one
thing
the
trader
was
dead
and
his
wife
had
got
a
place
in
the
city
with
a
very
nice
lady
and
he
hoped
to
see
her
when
he
went
to
new
orleans
pa
i
wonder
how
slavery
came
to
be
i
should
hate
to
belong
to
anybody
would
you
pa
why
yes
darling
but
then
the
negroes
are
contented
and
take
their
freedom
if
you
would
give
it
to
them
i
do
know
about
that
pa
there
was
mr
le
grange
peter
mr
le
grange
used
to
dress
him
so
fine
and
treat
him
so
well
that
he
thought
no
one
would
ever
tempt
peter
to
leave
him
and
he
came
north
with
him
every
year
for
three
or
four
summers
and
he
always
made
out
that
he
was
afraid
of
the
abolitionists
bobolitionists
he
used
to
call
them
and
mr
le
grange
just
believed
that
peter
was
in
earnest
and
somehow
he
got
mrs
le
grange
to
bring
his
wife
north
to
wait
on
her
and
when
they
both
got
here
they
both
left
and
mrs
le
grange
had
to
wait
on
herself
until
she
got
another
servant
she
told
me
she
had
got
enough
of
the
north
and
never
wanted
to
see
it
again
so
long
as
she
lived
that
she
would
have
taken
three
thousand
dollars
for
them
well
darling
they
would
have
never
left
if
these
meddlesome
abolitionists
had
put
it
in
their
heads
but
darling
do
bother
your
brain
about
such
matters
see
what
i
have
bought
you
this
morning
said
he
handing
her
a
necklace
of
the
purest
pearls
here
darling
is
a
present
for
you
camilla
took
the
necklace
and
gazing
absently
upon
it
said
i
ca
understand
it
what
is
it
my
little
philosopher
that
you
ca
understand
pa
i
ca
understand
slavery
that
man
made
me
think
it
was
something
very
bad
do
you
think
it
can
be
right
le
croix
face
flushed
suddenly
and
he
bit
his
lip
but
said
nothing
and
commenced
reading
the
paper
why
do
you
answer
me
pa
le
croix
brow
grew
darker
but
he
tried
to
conceal
his
vexation
and
quietly
said
darling
never
mind
puzzle
your
little
head
about
matters
you
can
not
understand
and
which
our
wisest
statesmen
can
not
solve
camilla
said
no
more
but
a
new
train
of
thought
had
been
awakened
she
had
lived
so
much
among
the
slaves
and
had
heard
so
many
tales
of
sorrow
breathed
confidentially
into
her
ears
that
she
had
unconsciously
imbibed
their
view
of
the
matter
and
without
comprehending
the
injustice
of
the
system
she
had
learned
to
view
it
from
their
standpoint
of
observation
what
she
had
seen
of
slavery
in
the
south
had
awakened
her
sympathy
and
compassion
what
she
had
heard
of
it
in
the
north
had
aroused
her
sense
of
justice
she
had
seen
the
old
system
under
a
new
light
the
good
seed
was
planted
which
was
yet
to
yield
its
harvest
of
blessed
deeds
chapter
iii
what
is
the
matter
said
pierre
le
grange
as
he
entered
suddenly
the
of
his
wife
georgietta
le
grange
and
saw
her
cutting
off
the
curls
from
the
head
of
little
girl
about
five
years
old
the
child
of
a
favorite
slave
matter
enough
said
the
angry
wife
her
cheeks
red
with
excitement
and
her
eyes
half
blinded
with
tears
of
vexation
this
child
sha
stay
here
and
if
she
does
she
shall
never
again
be
taken
for
mine
who
took
her
for
yours
what
has
happened
that
has
brought
about
all
this
excitement
just
wait
a
minute
said
georgietta
trying
to
frame
her
excitement
into
words
yesterday
i
invited
the
le
fevres
and
the
le
counts
and
a
northern
lady
they
had
stopping
with
mrs
le
fevre
to
dine
with
us
i
told
ellen
to
have
the
servants
all
cleaned
up
and
looking
as
well
as
possible
and
so
i
distributed
around
more
than
a
dozen
turbans
for
i
wanted
king
to
see
how
much
better
and
happier
our
negroes
looked
here
than
they
do
when
they
are
free
in
the
north
and
what
should
ellen
do
but
dress
up
her
little
minx
in
her
best
clothes
and
curl
her
hair
and
let
her
run
around
in
the
front
yard
so
she
overdid
the
thing
said
le
grange
beginning
to
comprehend
the
trouble
yes
she
did
but
she
will
never
do
it
again
exclaimed
mrs
le
grange
her
dark
eyes
flashing
defiantly
le
grange
bit
his
lip
but
said
nothing
he
saw
the
storm
that
was
brewing
and
about
to
fall
on
the
head
of
the
hapless
child
and
mother
and
thought
that
he
would
do
nothing
to
increase
it
when
mrs
le
fevre
continued
georgietta
alighted
from
the
carriage
she
noticed
the
child
and
calling
the
attention
of
the
whole
party
to
her
said
how
beautiful
she
is
the
very
image
of
her
father
le
grange
said
she
after
passing
the
compliments
of
the
day
congratulate
you
on
having
such
a
beautiful
child
she
is
the
very
image
of
her
father
and
how
large
she
is
for
her
age
just
then
marie
came
to
the
door
and
said
not
my
sister
that
is
ellen
child
i
saw
the
gentlemen
exchange
glances
and
the
young
ladies
screw
up
their
mouths
to
hide
their
merriment
while
mrs
le
fevre
with
all
her
obtuseness
seemed
to
comprehend
the
blunder
and
she
said
you
must
excuse
me
for
my
poor
old
eyes
are
getting
so
good
for
nothing
i
can
hardly
tell
one
person
from
the
other
i
blundered
some
kind
of
answer
i
hardly
know
what
i
said
i
was
almost
ready
to
die
with
vexation
but
this
shall
never
happen
again
what
are
you
going
to
do
you
see
what
i
have
begun
to
do
i
am
going
to
have
all
this
curling
business
broken
up
and
i
am
going
to
have
her
dressed
in
domestic
like
the
other
little
niggers
i
let

and
as
soon
as
a
trader
comes
along
i
mean
to
sell
her
i
want
a
new
set
of
pearls
anyhow
le
grange
made
no
reply
he
was
fond
of
the
child
but
knowing
what
a
termagant
his
wife
was
he
thought
that
silence
like
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valor
and
hastily
beat
a
retreat
from
her
presence
take
these
curls
and
throw
them
away
said
mrs
le
grange
to
sally
her
move
quick
and
take
this
child
into
the
kitchen
and
do
let
me
see
her
in
the
front
yard

georgiette
in
a
sharp
shrill
tone

chapter
iv
i
am
really
sorry
ellen
but
i
ca
help
it
georgiette
has
taken
a
dislike
to
the
child
and
there
is
no
living
in
peace
with
her
unless
i
sell
the
child
or
take
it
away
oh
pierre
you
would
not
sell
that
child
when
it
is
your
own
flesh
and
blood
le
grange
winced
under
these
words
no
ellen
i
never
consent
to
sell
the
child
but
it
wo
do
for
her
to
stay
here
i
made
up
my
mind
to
send
her
north
and
have
her
educated
and
then
i
never
see
my
darling
any
more
but
ellen
that
is
better
than
having
her
here
to
be
knocked
around
by
georgiette
and
if
i
die
to
be
sold
as
a
slave
it
is
the
best
thing
i
can
do
hang
old
mrs
le
fevre
tongue
but
i
guess
it
would
have
come
out
some
time
or
the
other
i
just
tell
you
what
i
do
ellen
take
the
child
down
to
new
orleans
and
make
out
to
georgiette
that
i
am
going
to
sell
her
but
instead
of
that
i
get
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
going
to
pennsylvania
to
take
her
with
him
and
have
her
boarded
there
and
educated
nobody
need
know
anything
about
her
being
colored
send
you
both
ellen
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
plantation
is
running
down
and
the
crops
are
so
short
this
year
i
ca
afford
it
but
when
times
get
better
i
send
you
up
there
and
tell
you
where
you
can
find
her
well
pierre
that
is
better
than
having
missus
knocking
her
around
or
selling
her
to
one
of
those
old
mean
nigger
traders
and
never
having
a
chance
to
see
my
darling
no
more
but
pierre
before
you
take
her
away
wo
you
please
give
me
her
likeness
maybe
i
know
her
when
i
see
her
again
le
grange
consented
and
when
he
went
to
the
city
again
he
told
his
wife
he
was
going
to
sell
the
child
i
am
glad
of
it
said
georgiette
i
would
have
her
mother
sold
but
we
ca
spare
her
she
is
so
handy
with
her
needle
and
does
all
the
cutting
out
on
the
place
le
grange
plan
the
whole
fact
is
this
joe
i
am
in
an
awkward
fix
i
have
got
myself
into
a
scrape
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
out
of
it
you
were
good
at
such
things
when
we
were
at
college
and
i
want
you
to
try
your
hand
again
well
what
the
difficulty
now
well
it
is
rather
a
serious
one
i
have
got
a
child
on
my
hands
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
it
whose
child
is
it
now
that
just
where
the
difficulty
lies
it
is
the
child
of
one
of
my
girls
but
it
looks
so
much
like
me
that
my
wife
do
want
it
on
the
place
i
am
too
hard
up
just
now
to
take
the
child
and
her
mother
north
and
take
care
of
them
there
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
too
humane
to
have
the
child
sold
here
as
a
slave
now
in
a
word
do
you
think
that
among
your
abolitionist
friends
in
the
north
you
could
find
any
one
who
would
raise
the
child
and
bring
it
up
like
a
white
child
i
do
know
about
that
pierre
there
are
a
number
of
our
people
in
the
north
who
do
two
things
they
hate
slavery
and
hate
negroes
they
feel
like
the
woman
who
in
writing
to
her
husband
said
they
say
or
do
say
that
absence
conquers
love
for
the
longer
you
stay
away
the
better
i
love
you
but
then
i
know
some
who
i
believe
are
really
sincere
and
who
would
do
anything
to
help
the
colored
people
i
think
i
know
two
or
three
families
who
would
be
willing
to
take
the
child
and
do
a
good
part
by
her
if
you
say
so
i
will
write
to
a
friend
whom
i
have
now
in
mind
and
if
they
will
consent
i
will
take
the
child
with
me
when
i
go
north
provided
i
can
do
it
without
having
it
discovered
that
she
is
colored
for
it
would
put
me
in
an
awkward
fix
to
have
it
known
that
i
took
a
colored
child
away
with
me
oh
never
fear
said
pierre
slapping
his
friend
on
the
shoulder
the
child
is
whiter
than
you
are
and
you
know
you
can
pass
for
white
true
to
his
promise
josiah
collins
wrote
to
a
quaker
friend
whom
he
knew
in
pennsylvania
and
told
him
the
particulars
of
the
history
and
the
wishes
of
her
father
and
the
compensation
he
would
give
in
a
few
days
he
received
a
favorable
response
in
which
the
friend
told
him
he
was
glad
to
have
the
privilege
of
rescuing
one
of
that
fated
race
from
a
doom
more
cruel
than
the
grave
that
the
compensation
was
no
object
that
they
had
lost
their
only
child
and
hoped
that
she
would
in
a
measure
fill
the
void
in
their
hearts
highly
gratified
with
the
kind
letter
of
the
friend
le
grange
gave
the
child
into
the
charge
of
josiah
collins
and
putting
a
check
for
five
hundred
dollars
in
his
hand
parted
with
them
at
the
station
he
went
back
into
the
country
and
told
his
wife
that
he
had
found
a
trader
who
thought
the
child
so
beautiful
and
that
he
had
bought
her
to
raise
as
a
fancy
girl
and
had
given
him
five
hundred
dollars
for
her
and
here
said
he
handing
her
a
set
of
beautiful
pearls
is
my
peace
offering
georgette
eyes
glistened
as
she
entertwined
the
pearls
amid
the
wealth
of
her
raven
hair
and
clasped
them
upon
her
beautifully
rounded
arms
what
mattered
it
to
her
if
every
jewel
cost
a
heart
throb
and
if
the
whole
set
were
bought
with
the
price
of
blood
they
suited
her
style
of
beauty
and
she
cared
not
what
they
cost
proud
imperious
and
selfish
she
knew
no
law
but
her
own
will
no
gratification
but
the
enjoyment
of
her
own
desires
passing
from
the
boudoir
of
his
wife
he
sought
the
room
where
ellen
sat
busily
cutting
and
arranging
the
clothing
for
the
field
hands
and
gazing
furtively
around
he
said
here
is
minnie
likeness
i
have
managed
all
right
thank
heaven
said
the
sad
hearted
mother
as
she
paused
to
dry
her
tears
and
then
resumed
her
needle
anything
is
better
than
slavery
chapter
v
before
i
proceed
any
further
with
my
story
let
me
tell
the
reader
something
of
the
le
granges
whom
i
have
so
unceremoniously
introduced
le
grange
like
le
croix
was
of
french
and
spanish
descent
and
his
father
had
also
been
a
haytian
refugee
but
there
the
similitude
ends
unlike
le
croix
he
had
grown
up
a
gay
and
reckless
young
man
fond
of
sports
and
living
an
aimless
life
his
father
had
on
his
plantation
a
beautiful
quadroon
girl
named
ellen
whom
he
had
bought
in
richmond
because
she
begged
him
to
buy
her
when
he
had
bought
her
mother
who
had
been
recommended
to
him
as
a
cook
they
had
been
servants
in
what
was
called
one
of
the
first
families
of
virginia
and
had
been
treated
by
their
mistress
with
more
kindness
and
consideration
than
generally
fell
to
the
lot
of
persons
in
their
condition
as
long
as
she
lived
they
had
been
well
fed
and
well
clothed
and
except
the
deprivation
of
their
freedom
had
known
but
few
of
the
hardships
so
incident
to
slave
life
but
a
reverse
had
fallen
upon
them
their
mistress
had
intended
to
set
them
free
but
dying
suddenly
she
had
failed
to
carry
out
her
intention
her
property
fell
into
the
hands
of
distant
heirs
who
sold
it
all
and
divided
it
among
themselves
ellen
and
her
mother
were
put
up
at
auction
when
a
kindly
looking
old
frenchman
bought
the
mother
ellen
stood
trembling
by
but
when
she
saw
her
mother
new
master
she
started
forth
and
kneeling
at
his
feet
she
begged
him
to
buy
her
the
mother
joined
in
and
said
do
massa
and
i
serve
you
faithful
day
and
night
there
is
a
heap
of
work
in
these
old
bones
yet
mr
le
grange
told
her
to
be
quiet
and
he
would
buy
her
and
true
to
his
word
although
the
bidding
ran
high
and
the
competition
was
fierce
he
bought
her
and
the
next
day
he
started
with
them
for
his
plantation
on
red
river
his
son
louis
had
just
graduated
and
was
spending
the
winter
at
home
in
just
that
mood
of
which
it
is
said
that
satan
finds
some
mischief
for
idle
hands
to
do
milly
who
knew
the
wiles
of
the
world
better
than
ellen
tried
to
keep
her
as
much
as
possible
out
of
his
way
but
her
caution
was
all
in
vain
she
saw
her
child
engulfed
as
thousands
of
her
race
had
been
mrs
le
grange
when
she
became
apprised
of
the
condition
of
things
grew
very
angry
but
instead
of
venting
her
indignation
upon
the
head
of
her
offending
son
she
poured
out
the
vials
of
her
wrath
upon
the
defenseless
girl
she
made
up
her
mind
to
sell
her
off
the
place
and
picked
the
opportunity
while
her
son
was
absent
to
send
her
to
a
trader
pen
in
the
city
when
louis
came
home
he
found
milly
looking
very
sullen
and
distressed
and
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
what
is
the
matter
said
louis
matter
enough
said
milly
missus
done
gone
and
sold
ellen
sold
ellen
why
how
did
that
happen
why
she
found
out
all
about
her
and
said
she
should
not
stay
on
the
place
another
day
and
so
she
sent
her
down
to
orleans
to
the
nigger
traders
and
my
heart
most
broke
and
milly
sat
down
wiping
her
tears
with
her
apron
never
mind
milly
said
louis
i
go
down
to
new
orleans
and
bring
her
back
mother
do
as
she
pleases
with
me
as
if
i
were
a
boy
and
must
always
be
tied
to
her
apron
string
i
got
some
money
of
my
own
and
i
mean
to
find
ellen
if
i
have
to
look
all
over
the
country
he
entered
the
dining
room
and
saw
his
mother
seated
at
the
tea
table
looking
as
bland
and
pleasant
as
a
spring
morning
and
asked
where
is
ellen
the
smile
died
from
her
lips
and
she
answered
curtly
she
is
out
of
reach
i
sold
her
but
where
have
you
sold
her
out
of
your
reach
and
that
is
all
i
am
going
to
tell
you
louis
without
saying
another
word
went
out
to
the
coachman
and
asked
what
time
the
cars
left
the
station
ten
minutes
to
nine
can
you
take
me
there
in
time
to
reach
the
train
i
want
to
go
to
the
city
tonight
dunno
massa
my
best
horse
is
lame
and
what
never
mind
your
excuse
here
said
he
throwing
him
a
dollar
hitch
up
as
quick
as
possible
and
take
me
there
without
any
or
all
right
massa
said
sam
grinning
with
delight
i
have
you
over
there
in
short
order
the
carriage
harnessed
samuel
found
no
difficulty
with
his
horses
and
reached
the
depot
almost
a
half
hour
before
the
time
louis
arrived
in
the
city
after
midnight
and
the
next
day
he
devoted
to
hunting
for
ellen
he
searched
through
different
slave
pens
inquired
of
all
the
traders
until
at
last
ready
to
abandon
his
search
in
hopelessness
he
heard
of
a
private
jail
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
nothing
daunted
by
his
failure
he
found
the
place
and
ellen
also
the
trader
eyed
him
keenly
and
saw
from
his
manner
that
he
was
in
earnest
about
having
the
girl
she
is
not
for
sale
in
this
city
whoever
buys
her
must
give
me
a
pledge
to
take
her
out
of
this
city
that
was
the
bargain
i
made
with
her
mistress
she
made
me
promise
her
that
i
would
sell
her
to
no
one
in
the
vicinity
of
the
city
in
fact
she
wanted
me
to
sell
her
out
of
the
way
of
her
son
his
mother
said
she
had
dedicated
him
to
the
blessed
virgin
and
i
reckon
she
wanted
to
keep
him
out
of
the
way
of
temptation
now
what
will
you
give
me
for
her
will
you
take
a
thousand
for
her
now
you
ai
saying
nothing
said
the
trader
shutting
one
eye
and
spitting
on
the
floor
how
will
twelve
hundred
do
it
wo
do
at
all
not
for
such
a
fancy
article
as
that
i
rather
keep
her
for
myself
than
sell
her
at
such
a
low
figure
why
just
look
at
her
why
she
pretty
as
a
picture
look
at
that
neck
and
her
shoulders
see
how
she
carries
her
head
and
look
at
that
splendid
head
of
hair
why
some
of
our
nabobs
would
give
three
thousand
dollars
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
let
you
have
her
for
two
thousand
dollars
fancy
article
is
cheap
at
that
louis
demurred
but
the
trader
was
inexorable
and
rather
than
let
the
opportunity
to
rescue
ellen
from
him
escape
he
paid
the
exorbitant
price
and
had
her
brought
to
his
hotel
his
next
work
was
to
get
a
house
for
ellen
and
have
her
taken
there
installed
as
his
mistress
he
then
went
back
to
the
plantation
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
his
mother
soon
thought
he
was
reconciled
about
the
loss
of
ellen
only
milly
knew
his
secret
and
she
kept
it
as
a
secret
thing
i
got
some
pleasant
news
for
you
louis
said
mrs
le
grange
one
day
to
her
son
your
uncle
and
cousin
are
coming
down
from
virginia
and
i
want
you
to
be
all
attention
to
your
cousin
for
she
is
very
rich
she
has
a
fortune
in
her
right
which
was
left
her
by
her
grandmother
and
besides
she
will
have
another
one
at
her
father
death
added
to
which
they
say
she
is
a
very
beautiful
girl
great
preparations
were
made
for
the
expected
guests
georgiette
was
mrs
le
grange
brother
child
and
having
been
separated
from
him
for
more
than
fifteen
years
she
was
full
of
joyful
anticipations
when
he
apprised
her
of
his
intention
of
visiting
her
in
company
with
his
daughter
at
length
the
welcome
day
arrived
and
mrs
le
grange
stood
arranging
her
jewels
and
ribbons
to
receive
the
guests
you
are
welcome
to
louisiana
said
she
removing
georgiette
shawl
and
tenderly
kissing
her
and
you
too
brother
she
said
as
monteith
followed
his
daughter
how
beautiful
georgiette
has
grown
since
i
saw
her
why
darling
you
look
charming
i
afraid
i
sha
be
able
to
keep
you
long
for
some
of
the
beaux
will
surely
run
away
with
you
my
son
said
mrs
le
grange
introducing
louis
who
just
then
entered
the
door
louis
bowed
very
low
and
expressed
his
pleasure
in
seeing
them
and
hoped
they
would
have
a
happy
time
and
that
nothing
should
be
wanting
on
his
part
to
make
it
so
very
pleasantly
passed
the
time
away
georgiette
was
in
high
and
charming
spirits
and
many
a
pleasant
ride
and
delightful
saunter
she
took
with
her
cousin
through
the
woods
or
in
visiting
other
plantations
she
was
very
popular
among
the
sons
admired
by
the
young
men
but
feared
and
envied
by
the
girls
and
thus
the
hours
passed
in
a
whirl
of
pleasurable
excitement
until
louis
actually
imagined
himself
in
love
with
her
and
found
himself
one
pleasant
afternoon
offering
her
his
hand
and
heart
she
blushed
and
sighed
and
referred
him
to
her
papa
and
in
a
few
weeks
they
were
engaged
at
length
the
time
of
their
departure
came
and
louis
after
accompanying
them
to
new
orleans
returned
to
make
ready
for
the
wedding
his
father
made
him
a
present
of
a
large
plantation
which
he
stocked
from
his
own
purse
with
three
hundred
slaves
and
installed
ellen
there
as
housekeeper
till
the
arrival
of
the
new
mistress
chapter
vi
thee
is
welcome
to
said
the
cheerful
voice
of
thomas
carpenter
as
josiah
collins
alighted
bringing
with
him
his
charge
and
is
this
the
little
child
thee
wrote
me
about
i
am
heartily
glad
thee
has
rescued
her
from
that
dreadful
system
anna
said
he
turning
to
his
wife
who
had
just
entered
the
room
here
is
our
friend
josiah
collins
and
the
little
girl
i
told
thee
about
i
am
glad
thee
has
come
said
anna
sit
down
and
make
thyself
at
home
and
this
is
the
little
girl
thee
wrote
thomas
about
she
is
a
beautiful
child
continued
anna
gazing
admiringly
at
the
child
i
hope
she
will
be
contented
does
she
fret
about
her
mother
not
much
she
would
sometimes
ask
is
mamma
but
the
ladies
in
the
cars
were
very
kind
to
her
and
she
was
quite
at
home
with
them
i
told
them
i
was
taking
her
north
that
i
thought
the
north
would
better
agree
with
her
and
that
it
was
not
convenient
for
her
mother
to
come
on
just
now
i
was
really
amused
with
the
attention
she
received
from
the
southern
ladies
knowing
how
they
would
have
shrunk
from
such
offices
if
they
had
known
that
one
drop
of
the
outcast
blood
ran
in
her
veins
why
josiah
said
anna
i
have
always
heard
that
there
was
more
prejudice
against
the
colored
people
in
the
north
than
in
the
south
there
is
a
difference
in
the
manifestations
of
this
feeling
but
i
do
not
think
there
is
as
much
prejudice
here
as
there
here
we
have
a
prejudice
which
is
formed
from
traditional
ideas
we
see
in
many
parts
of
the
north
a
very
few
of
the
colored
people
and
our
impressions
of
them
have
received
their
coloring
more
or
less
from
what
the
slaveholders
have
said
of
them
we
have
been
taught
that
they
are
idle
improvident
and
unfitted
for
freedom
and
incapable
of
progression
and
when
we
see
them
in
the
cities
we
see
them
overshadowed
by
wealth
enterprise
and
activity
so
that
our
unfavorable
impressions
are
too
often
confirmed
still
if
one
of
that
class
rises
above
this
low
mental
condition
we
know
that
there
are
many
who
are
willing
to
give
such
a
one
a
healthy
recognition
i
know
that
there
are
those
that
have
great
obstacles
to
overcome
but
i
think
that
while
southerners
may
have
more
personal
likings
for
certain
favorite
servants
they
have
stronger
prejudices
than
even
we
have
or
if
they
have
no
more
than
we
have
they
have
more
and
show
it
more
virulently
but
i
think
they
do
not
seem
to
have
any
horror
of
personal
contact
of
course
not
constant
familiarity
with
the
race
has
worn
away
all
sense
of
physical
repulsion
but
there
is
a
prejudice
which
ought
to
be
an
american
feeling
it
is
a
prejudice
against
their
rising
in
the
scale
of
humanity
a
prejudice
which
virtually
says
you
are
down
and
i
mean
to
keep
you
down
as
a
servant
i
tolerate
you
you
are
useful
as
you
are
valuable
but
rise
one
step
in
the
scale
of
being
and
i
am
ready
to
put
you
down
i
see
this
in
the
treatment
that
the
free
colored
people
receive
in
parts
of
the
south
they
seem
to
me
to
be
the
outcasts
of
an
outcast
race
they
are
denied
the
right
to
walk
in
certain
public
places
accessible
to
every
class
unless
they
go
as
nurses
and
are
forbidden
to
assemble
in
evening
meetings
and
forced
to
be
in
the
house
unless
they
have
passes
by
an
early
hour
in
the
night
and
in
fact
they
are
hampered
or
hemmed
in
on
every
side
subject
to
insults
from
any
rude
coarse
or
brutal
white
and
in
case
of
outrages
denied
their
testimony
prejudiced
as
we
are
in
pennsylvania
we
do
not
go
that
far
but
josiah
we
have
much
to
blush
for
in
pennsylvania
colored
people
are
denied
the
privilege
of
riding
in
our
street
cars
only
last
week
when
i
was
in
philadelphia
i
saw
a
very
colored
woman
with
a
child
who
looked
too
feeble
to
walk
and
the
child
too
heavy
for
her
to
carry
she
beckoned
to
a
conductor
but
he
swept
by
and
took
no
more
heed
of
her
than
if
she
had
been
a
dog
there
was
a
young
lady
sitting
in
the
car
who
remarked
to
her
mother
as
a
very
white
man
entered
they
will
let
that
filthy
creature
ride
and
prohibit
a
decent
respectable
colored
person
the
mother
quietly
assented
from
her
dress
i
took
her
to
be
a
quakeress
for
she
had
a
lovely
dress
of
silk
the
young
lady
had
scarcely
uttered
the
words
when
a
young
man
who
sat
next
the
mother
deliberately
arose
and
beckoned
to
the
man
with
the
sooty
clothes
to
take
his
seat
but
fortunately
for
the
quakeress
a
lady
who
was
sitting
next
her
daughter
arose
just
at
that
moment
and
left
the
seat
and
the
old
man
without
noticing
the
manoeuvre
passed
over
to
the
other
side
and
thus
avoided
the
contact
i
was
amused
however
about
one
thing
for
the
young
man
who
gave
up
his
seat
was
compelled
to
ride
about
a
mile
standing
served
him
right
said
thomas
carpenter
it
was
a
very
contemptible
action
to
attempt
to
punish
the
hardihood
of
the
young
lady
by
attempting
to
soil
her
mother
dress
and
yet
little
souls
who
feel
a
morbid
satisfaction
in
trampling
on
the
weak
always
sink
themselves
in
the
scale
of
manhood
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
the
tea
bell
rang
and
josiah
and
his
little
charge
sat
down
to
a
well
supplied
table
for
the
friends
though
plain
and
economical
are
no
enemies
to
good
living
anna
had
brought
the
in
which
their
own
darling
had
sat
a
few
months
before
when
she
had
made
gladness
and
sunshine
around
her
parent
path
there
was
a
tender
light
in
the
eye
of
the
quakeress
as
she
dusted
the
chair
and
sat
minnie
at
the
table
do
you
think
said
thomas
addressing
josiah
that
we
will
ever
outgrow
this
wicked
miserable
prejudice
oh
yes
but
it
must
be
the
work
of
time
both
races
have
their
work
to
do
the
colored
man
must
outgrow
his
old
condition
of
things
and
thus
create
around
him
a
new
class
of
associations
this
generation
has
known
him
as
a
being
landless
poor
and
ignorant
one
of
the
most
important
things
for
him
to
do
is
to
acquire
land
he
will
never
gain
his
full
measure
of
strength
until
like
anteus
he
touches
the
earth
and
i
think
here
is
the
great
fault
or
misfortune
of
the
race
they
seem
to
me
to
readily
accept
their
situation
and
not
to
let
their
industrial
aspirations
rise
high
enough
i
wish
they
had
more
of
the
earth
hunger
that
characterizes
the
german
or
the
concentration
of
purpose
which
we
see
in
the
jews
i
think
said
thomas
that
the
jews
and
negroes
have
one
thing
in
common
and
that
is
their
power
of
endurance
they
like
the
negro
have
lived
upon
an
idea
and
that
is
the
hope
of
a
deliverer
yet
to
come
but
i
think
this
characteristic
more
strongly
developed
in
the
jews
than
in
the
negroes
doubtless
it
is
but
their
origin
and
history
have
been
different
the
jews
have
a
common
ancestry
and
grand
traditions
that
have
left
alive
their
pride
of
race
have
abraham
to
our
father
they
said
when
their
necks
were
bowed
beneath
the
roman
yoke
but
i
do
not
think
the
negro
can
trace
with
certainty
his
origin
back
to
any
of
the
older
civilizations
and
here
for
more
than
two
hundred
years
his
history
has
been
a
record
of
blood
and
tears
of
ignorance
degradation
and
slavery
and
when
nominally
free
prejudice
has
assigned
him
the
lowest
positions
and
the
humblest
situations
i
have
not
much
hope
of
their
progress
while
they
are
enslaved
in
the
south
well
josiah
i
have
faith
enough
in
the
ultimate
triumph
of
our
principles
to
believe
that
slavery
will
bite
the
dust
before
long
i
do
know
friend
carpenter
for
the
system
is
very
strongly
rooted
and
grounded
in
the
institutions
of
the
land
and
has
entrenched
itself
in
the
strongholds
of
church
and
state
fashion
custom
and
social
life
and
yet
when
i
was
in
the
south
i
saw
on
every
hand
a
growing
differentiation
towards
the
government
do
you
know
josiah
that
i
have
more
hope
from
the
madness
and
folly
of
the
south
than
i
have
from
the
wisdom
and
virtue
of
the
north
i
have
read
too
the
gods
would
destroy
they
first
make
mad
chapter
vii
ten
years
have
elapsed
since
minnie
came
to
brighten
the
home
of
thomas
carpenter
and
although
within
the
heart
of
anna
there
is
a
spot
forever
green
and
sacred
to
the
memory
of
her
only
child
yet
minnie
holds
an
undivided
place
in
their
affections
there
is
only
one
subject
which
is
to
them
a
source
of
concern
it
is
the
connection
of
minnie
with
the
colored
race
not
that
they
love
her
less
on
account
of
the
blood
that
is
in
her
veins
but
they
dread
the
effect
its
discovery
would
have
upon
the
pleasant
social
circle
with
which
she
is
surrounded
and
also
the
fear
that
the
revelation
would
be
painful
to
her
they
know
that
she
is
in
her
principles
they
have
been
careful
to
instil
into
her
young
mind
a
reverence
for
humanity
and
to
recognize
beneath
all
externals
whether
of
condition
or
color
the
human
soul
all
written
over
with
the
handmarks
of
divinity
and
the
common
claims
of
humanity
she
has
known
for
years
that
their
home
has
been
one
of
the
stations
of
the
underground
railroad
and
the
lecturer
whether
white
or
colored
has
always
been
among
the
welcomed
guests
of
her
home
still
they
shrink
from
the
effect
the
knowledge
would
have
on
her
mind
they
know
she
is
willing
to
work
for
the
colored
race
but
they
could
not
divine
what
it
cost
her
to
work
with
them
it
seems
to
me
anna
that
we
ought
to
reveal
to
minnie
the
fact
of
her
connection
with
the
colored
race
i
am
afraid
that
she
will
learn
in
some
way
that
will
rudely
shock
her
whereas
we
might
break
it
to
her
in
the
tenderest
manner
every
time
a
fugitive
comes
i
dread
that
our
darling
will
be
recognized
nay
thomas
thy
fears
have
made
thee
over
sensitive
who
would
imagine
he
saw
in
this
bright
and
radiant
girl
of
fifteen
the
little
child
we
took
to
our
hearts
and
home
i
never
feel
any
difference
between
her
and
the
whitest
child
in
the
village
as
far
as
prejudice
is
concerned
and
if
every
body
in
the
village
knew
her
origin
i
would
love
her
just
as
much
as
i
ever
did
for
she
is
a
dear
good
child
well
dear
if
you
think
it
is
best
to
keep
it
a
secret
i
will
not
interfere
but
we
must
not
forget
that
minnie
will
soon
be
a
young
lady
that
she
is
very
beautiful
and
even
now
she
begins
to
attract
admiration
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
right
for
us
to
let
her
marry
a
white
man
without
letting
her
know
the
prejudices
of
society
and
giving
her
a
chance
to
explain
to
him
the
conditions
of
things
yes
said
anna
that
is
true
i
have
heard
that
traces
of
that
blood
will
sometimes
reappear
even
in
grandchildren
when
it
has
not
been
detected
in
the
first
and
to
guard
against
difficulty
which
might
arise
from
such
a
course
i
think
it
is
better
to
apprise
her
of
the
facts
in
the
case
it
is
time
enough
for
that
i
want
her
to
finish
her
education
before
she
thinks
of
marrying
and
i
am
getting
her
ready
to
go
to
philadelphia
where
she
will
find
an
excellent
school
as
i
have
heard
it
very
highly
spoken
of
she
is
young
and
happy
trouble
will
come
time
enough
let
me
not
hasten
its
advent
but
if
time
has
only
strewed
the
path
of
minnie
with
flowers
and
ripened
the
promised
beauty
of
her
childhood
it
has
borne
a
heavy
hand
upon
the
destiny
of
the
la
croix
family
la
croix
is
dead
but
before
his
death
he
took
the
precaution
to
have
louis
emancipated
and
then
made
him
a
joint
heir
with
his
daughter
the
will
he
entrusted
to
the
care
of
camilla
but
the
deed
of
emancipation
he
placed
in
the
hands
of
miriam
saying
here
are
your
free
papers
and
here
are
louis
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
sure
but
death
and
it
is
well
to
be
on
the
safe
side
some
one
might
be
curious
enough
to
search
out
his
history
and
if
there
should
be
no
legal
claim
to
his
freedom
he
might
be
robbed
of
both
his
liberty
and
his
inheritance
so
keep
these
papers
and
if
ever
the
hour
comes
when
you
or
he
should
need
them
you
must
show
me
miriam
did
as
she
was
bidden
but
her
heart
was
lighter
when
she
knew
that
freedom
had
come
so
near
her
and
louis
le
croix
before
his
death
had
sold
the
greater
part
of
his
slaves
and
invested
the
money
in
northern
bonds
and
good
northern
securities
camilla
had
married
a
gentleman
from
the
north
and
is
living
very
happily
upon
the
old
plantation
she
does
not
keep
an
overseer
and
tries
to
do
all
in
her
power
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
her
slaves
still
she
is
not
satisfied
with
the
system
and
is
trying
to
prepare
her
slaves
for
freedom
by
inducing
them
to
form
as
much
as
possible
habits
of
and
which
they
will
need
in
the
freedom
which
she
has
determined
they
shall
enjoy
as
soon
as
she
can
arrange
her
affairs
to
that
effect
but
she
also
has
to
proceed
with
a
great
deal
of
caution
the
south
is
in
a
state
of
agitation
and
foment
the
air
is
laden
with
rumors
of
a
rising
conflict
between
the
north
and
the
south
and
any
want
of
allegiance
to
southern
opinions
is
punished
either
as
a
crime
if
the
offender
is
a
man
or
with
social
ostracism
and
insult
if
a
woman
the
south
in
the
palmy
days
of
her
pride
and
power
would
never
tolerate
any
heresy
to
her
creed
whose
formula
of
statement
might
have
been
written
we
believe
in
the
divine
right
of
the
master
to
take
advantage
of
the
weakness
ignorance
and
poverty
of
the
slave
that
might
makes
right
and
that
success
belongs
to
the
strongest
arm
some
of
her
former
friends
were
beginning
to
eye
her
with
coldness
and
suspicion
because
she
would
not
join
in
their
fanatical
hatred
of
the
north
and
because
she
would
profess
her
devotion
to
the
old
flag
while
they
were
ready
to
spit
upon
and
trample
it
under
foot
her
adopted
brother
was
still
in
the
north
and
strange
to
say
he
did
not
share
her
feelings
his
sympathies
were
with
the
south
and
although
he
was
too
young
to
take
any
leading
part
in
the
events
there
about
to
transpire
yet
year
after
year
when
he
spent
his
vacations
at
home
he
attended
the
hustings
and
political
meetings
and
there
he
learned
to
consider
the
sentiment
my
country
right
or
wrong
as
a
proper
maxim
for
political
action
this
difference
in
their
sentiments
did
not
produce
the
least
estrangement
between
them
only
camilla
regretted
to
see
louis
ready
to
raise
his
hand
against
the
freedom
of
his
mother
race
although
he
was
perfectly
unconscious
of
his
connection
with
it
for
the
conflict
which
was
then
brewing
between
the
north
and
the
south
was
in
fact
a
struggle
between
despotism
and
idea
between
freedom
on
one
side
and
slavery
on
the
other
chapter
viii
commencement
over
what
are
you

very
pleasant
employment
i
do
envy
you
but
i
can
tell
you
something
better
than
that
what
is
it
said
his
companion
yawning
come
go
home
with
me
go
home
with
you
where
is
that
and
what
is
the
attraction
well
let
me
see
it
is
situated
in
one
of
the
most
beautiful
valleys
of
western
pennsylvania
our
village
is
environed
by
the
most
lovely
hills
and
nestling
among
the
trees
with
its
simple
churches
and
unpretending
homes
of
quiet
beauty
and
good
taste
it
is
one
of
the
most
pleasant
and
picturesque
places
i
ever
saw
and
besides
as
you
love
to
hunt
and
fish
we
have
one
of
the
finest
streams
of
trout
and
some
of
the
most
excellent
game
in
the
woods
is
that
all
why
is
that
enough
you
must
be
rather
hard
to
please
this
morning
think
so
yes
but
i
have
not
told
you
the
crowning
attraction
what
is
it
oh
one
of
the
most
beautiful
girls
i
ever
saw
we
call
her
the
lily
of
the
valley
describe
her
i
ca
it
would
be
like
attempting
to
paint
a
sun
beam
or
doing
what
no
painter
has
ever
done
sketch
a
rainbow
you
are
very
poetical
this
morning
but
i
want
you
to
do
as
our
president
sometimes
tells
us
proceed
from
the
abstract
to
the
concrete
well
let
me
begin
she
has
the
most
beautiful
little
feet
i
never
see
her
stepping
along
without
thinking
of
cinderella
and
the
glass
slipper
as
to
eyes
they
are
either
dark
brown
or
black
i
do
know
which
but
i
do
know
they
are
beautiful
and
her
hair
well
she
generally
wears
that
plain
in
deference
to
the
wishes
of
her
quaker
friends
but
sometimes
in
the
most
beautiful
ripples
of
golden
brown
i
ever
saw
that
will
do
now
tell
me
who
she
is
you
spoke
of
her
quaker
friends
is
she
not
their
daughter
no
there
seems
to
be
some
mystery
about
her
history
about
ten
years
ago
my
father
brought
her
to
josiah
carpenter
but
he
always
been
reticent
about
her
in
fact
i
never
took
the
pains
to
inquire
she
a
great
favorite
in
the
village
and
everybody
says
she
is
as
beautiful
as
she
is
good
and
vice
versa
well
i
like
to
see
this
paragon
of
yours
i
believe
i
go
well
let
us
get
ready
when
do
you
start
all
right
i
be
on
hand
and
with
these
words
the
two
friends
parted
to
meet
again
the
next
day
at
the
railroad
station
the
first
of
the
speakers
is
the
son
of
josiah
collins
and
his
friend
is
louis
le
croix
camilla
adopted
brother
he
is
somewhat
changed
within
the
last
ten
years
time
has
touched
the
golden
wealth
of
his
curls
with
a
beautiful
deep
auburn
and
the
rich
full
tones
of
his
voice
tell
that
departed
is
written
upon
his
childhood
he
is
strongly
southern
in
his
feelings
but
having
been
educated
in
the
north
whilst
he
is
an
enthusiast
in
defense
of
his
section
as
he
calls
the
south
he
is
neither
coarse
and
brutal
in
actions
nor
fanatical
in
his
devotion
to
slavery
he
thinks
the
negroes
are
doing
well
enough
in
slavery
if
the
abolitionists
would
only
let
matters
rest
and
he
feels
a
sense
of
honor
in
defending
the
south
she
is
his
mother
he
says
and
that
man
is
an
ingrate
who
will
not
stand
by
his
mother
and
defend
her
when
she
is
in
peril
he
and
charles
collins
are
fast
friends
but
on
the
subject
of
slavery
they
are
entirely
opposed
and
so
on
that
point
they
have
agreed
to
disagree
they
often
have
animated
and
exciting
discussions
but
they
pass
and
josiah
and
louis
are
just
as
friendly
as
they
were
before
there
were
two
arrivals
the
next
evening
in
the
quiet
village
of
one
was
charles
collins
the
other
his
southern
friend
who
was
received
with
the
warmest
welcome
and
soon
found
himself
at
home
in
the
pleasant
society
of
his
friend
family
the
evening
was
enlivened
with
social
chat
and
music
until
ten
when
josiah
gathered
his
children
and
having
read
the
bible
in
a
deeply
impressive
manner
breathed
one
of
the
most
simple
and
fervent
prayers
he
had
ever
heard
while
they
were
bending
at
prayer
in
this
pleasant
home
a
shabby
looking
man
came
walking
slowly
and
wearily
into
the
village
he
gazed
cautiously
around
and
looked
anxiously
in
the
street
as
though
he
were
looking
for
some
one
but
did
not
like
to
trust
his
business
to
every
one
at
length
he
saw
an
elderly
man
dressed
in
plain
clothes
and
a
broad
brim
hat
and
drawing
near
he
spoke
to
him
in
a
low
and
hesitating
voice
and
asked
if
he
knew
a
thomas
carpenter
my
name
is
carpenter
said
the
friend
come
with
me
there
was
something
in
the
voice
and
manner
of
the
friend
that
the
stranger
his
whole
manner
changed
a
peaceful
expression
stole
over
his
dark
sad
face
and
the
drooping
limbs
seemed
to
be
aroused
by
a
new
infusion
of
energy
come
in
said
thomas
as
he
reached
his
door
come
in
thee
welcome
to
stop
and
rest
with
us
anna
said
thomas
his
face
beaming
with
kindness
i
brought
thee
a
guest
here
is
another
passenger
by
the
underground
railroad
i
sure
thee
welcome
said
anna
handing
him
a
chair
sit
down
thee
looks
very
tired
where
did
thee
come
from
moses
that
was
the
fugitive
name
hesitated
a
moment
oh
never
fear
thee
among
friends
thee
need
not
be
afraid
to
tell
all
about
thyself
moses
then
told
them
that
he
had
come
from
kentucky
and
how
did
thee
escape
he
said
i
walked
from
lexington
to
covington
why
that
was
almost
one
hundred
miles
and
did
thee
walk
all
that
way
yes
sir
said
he
i
hid
by
day
and
walked
by
night
did
no
one
interrupt
yes
one
man
said
to
me
your
pass
i
suppose
i
must
have
grown
desperate
for
i
raised
my
fists
and
said
dem
my
passes
and
he
let
me
alone
i
do
know
whether
he
was
friendly
or
scared
but
he
let
me
alone
and
how
then
when
i
come
to
covington
i
found
that
i
could
not
come
across
the
river
without
a
pass
but
i
watched
my
chance
and
hid
myself
on
a
boat
and
i
got
across
i
heard
of
you
down
home
how
did
you
oh
we
got
some
few
friends
dere
but
we
allers
promise
not
to
tell
anna
and
thomas
smiled
at
his
reticence
which
had
grown
into
a
habit
were
you
badly
treated
not
so
bad
as
some
but
i
allers
wanted
my
freedom
i
did
well
we
will
not
talk
about
thee
any
more
if
thee
walked
all
that
distance
thee
must
be
very
tired
and
we
let
thee
rest
there
thy
bed
i
hope
thee
have
a
good
night
rest
and
feel
better
in
the
morning
thankee
marm
said
moses
you
mighty
good
oh
no
but
i
always
like
to
do
my
duty
by
my
fellow
men
now
be
quiet
and
get
a
good
night
sleep
thee
looks
excited
thee
must
be
uneasy
thee
among
friends
a
flood
of
emotions
crept
over
the
bosom
of
moses
when
his
kind
friends
left
the
room
was
this
freedom
and
was
this
the
long
wished
for
north
and
were
these
the
abolitionists
of
whom
he
had
heard
so
much
in
the
south
they
who
would
allure
the
colored
people
from
their
homes
in
the
south
and
then
leave
them
to
freeze
and
starve
in
the
north
he
had
heard
all
his
life
that
the
slaveholders
were
the
friends
of
the
south
and
the
language
of
his
soul
had
been
if
these
are
my
friends
save
me
from
my
foes
he
had
lived
all
his
life
among
the
white
people
of
the
south
and
had
been
owned
by
several
masters
but
he
did
not
know
that
there
was
so
much
kindness
among
the
white
race
till
he
had
rested
in
a
northern
home
and
among
northern
people
here
kindness
encouraged
his
path
and
in
that
peaceful
home
every
voice
that
fell
upon
his
ear
was
full
of
tenderness
and
sympathy
true
there
were
rough
coarse
brutal
men
even
in
that
village
who
for
a
few
dollars
or
to
prove
their
devotion
to
the
south
would
have
readily
remanded
him
to
his
master
but
he
was
not
aware
of
that
and
so
when
he
sank
to
his
rest
a
sense
of
peace
and
safety
stole
over
him
and
his
sleep
was
as
calm
and
peaceful
as
the
slumber
of
a
child
the
next
morning
he
looked
refreshed
but
still
his
strength
was
wasted
by
his
great
physical
exertion
and
mental
excitement
and
thomas
thought
he
had
better
rest
a
few
days
till
he
grew
stronger
and
better
prepared
to
travel
for
thomas
noticed
that
he
was
nervous
starting
at
the
sound
of
every
noise
and
often
turning
his
head
to
the
door
with
an
anxious
frightened
look
thomas
would
have
gladly
given
him
shelter
and
work
and
given
him
just
wages
but
he
dared
not
do
so
he
was
an
american
citizen
it
is
true
but
at
that
time
slavery
reigned
over
the
north
and
ruled
over
the
south
and
he
had
not
the
power
under
the
law
of
the
land
to
give
domicile
and
break
his
bread
to
that
poor
hunted
and
flying
man
for
even
then
they
were
hunting
in
the
south
and
sending
out
their
human
bloodhounds
to
search
for
him
in
the
north
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
from
the
summit
of
the
niagara
to
the
swollen
waters
of
the
mexican
gulf
from
the
golden
gates
of
sunrise
to
the
gorgeous
portals
of
departing
day
there
was
not
a
hill
so
high
a
forest
so
secluded
a
glen
so
sequestered
nor
mountain
so
steep
that
he
knew
he
could
not
be
tracked
and
hailed
in
the
name
of
the
general
government
what
the
news
friend
carpenter
any
new
arrivals
said
josiah
collins
in
a
low
voice
to
thomas
yes
a
very
interesting
case
ca
you
come
over
yes
after
breakfast
by
the
way
you
must
be
a
little
more
cautious
than
usual
charley
came
home
last
night
and
brought
a
young
friend
with
him
from
college
i
think
from
his
conversation
that
he
is
either
a
southerner
himself
or
in
deep
sympathy
with
the
south
both
men
spoke
in
low
tones
for
although
they
were
northerners
they
were
talking
about
a
subject
on
which
they
were
compelled
to
speak
with
bated
breaths
after
breakfast
josiah
came
over
but
moses
seemed
so
heavy
and
over
wearied
that
they
did
not
care
to
disturb
him
there
was
a
look
of
dejection
and
intense
sadness
on
the
thin
worn
face
and
a
hungry
look
in
the
mournful
eyes
as
if
his
soul
had
been
starving
for
kindness
and
sympathy
sometimes
he
would
forget
his
situation
and
speak
hopefully
of
the
future
but
still
there
was
a
weariness
that
he
could
not
shake
off
a
languor
that
seemed
to
pervade
every
nerve
and
muscle
thomas
thought
it
was
the
natural
reaction
of
the
deep
excitement
through
which
he
just
passed
that
the
tension
of
his
nerves
had
been
too
great
but
that
a
few
days
rest
and
quiet
would
restore
him
to
his
normal
condition
but
that
hope
soon
died
away
the
tension
excitement
and
consequent
exhaustion
had
been
too
much
reason
tottered
on
its
throne
and
he
became
a
raving
maniac
in
his
moments
of
delirium
he
would
imagine
that
he
was
escaping
from
slavery
that
the
pursuers
were
upon
his
back
that
they
had
caught
him
and
were
rebinding
him
about
to
take
him
back
to
slavery
and
then
it
was
heartrending
to
hear
him
beg
and
plead
to
be
carried
to
thomas
carpenter
he
would
reach
out
his
emaciated
hands
and
say
carry
me
to
carpenter
that
good
man
house
for
that
name
which
had
become
more
precious
to
him
than
a
household
to
his
soul
still
lingered
amid
shattered
cells
but
the
delirium
spent
its
force
and
through
the
tempests
of
his
bosom
the
light
of
reason
came
back
one
night
he
slept
more
soundly
than
usual
and
on
the
next
morning
his
faithful
friends
saw
from
the
expression
of
his
countenance
and
the
light
in
his
eyes
that
his
reason
had
returned
they
sent
for
their
family
physician
a
man
in
whose
honor
they
could
confide
all
that
careful
nursing
and
medical
skill
could
do
was
done
but
it
was
in
vain
his
strength
was
wasted
the
silver
cord
was
loosed
and
the
golden
bowl
was
broken
his
life
was
fast
ebbing
away
like
a
tempest
tossed
mariner
dying
in
sight
of
land
so
he
passing
away
from
earth
found
the
precious
longed
for
and
dearly
bought
prize
was
just
before
but
his
hand
was
too
feeble
to
grasp
his
arms
too
powerless
to
hold
it
his
friends
saw
from
the
expression
of
his
face
that
he
had
something
to
say
and
they
bent
down
to
catch
the
last
words
of
the
departing
spirit
i
am
dying
he
said
but
i
am
thankful
that
i
have
come
this
near
to
freedom
he
attempted
to
say
no
more
the
death
rattles
sounded
in
his
throat
the
shadows
that
never
deceive
flitted
his
face
and
he
was
dead
his
spirit
gone
back
to
god
another
witness
against
the
giant
crime
of
the
land
josiah
came
again
to
see
him
and
entered
the
room
just
as
the
released
spirit
winged
its
flight
silently
he
uncovered
him
as
if
paying
that
reverence
to
the
broken
casket
which
death
exacts
for
his
meanest
subjects
with
tenderness
and
respect
they
prepared
the
body
for
the
grave
followed
him
to
the
silent
tomb
and
left
him
to
his
dreamless
sleep
installment
missing
chapter
ix
friend
carpenter
i
have
brought
a
friend
to
see
you
he
is
a
real
southerner
and
i
have
been
trying
to
convert
him
but
have
been
almost
ready
to
give
it
up
as
a
hopeless
task
i
thought
as
you
are
so
much
better
posted
than
i
am
on
the
subject
might
be
able
to
convert
him
from
the
error
of
his
ways
he
is
a
fellow
my
college
chum
he
has
only
one
fault
he
will
defend
slavery
cure
him
of
that
and
i
think
he
will
be
as
near
perfect
as
young
men
generally
are
friend
carpenter
smiled
at
this
rally
and
said
it
takes
time
for
all
things
perhaps
your
friend
is
not
so
incorrigible
as
you
think
he
is
i
do
know
said
charley
but
here
he
is
he
can
speak
for
himself
oh
the
system
is
well
enough
of
itself
but
like
other
things
it
is
liable
to
abuse
i
think
my
young
friend
said
thomas
thee
has
never
examined
the
system
by
the
rule
of
impartial
justice
which
tells
us
to
do
to
all
men
as
we
would
have
them
do
to
us
if
thee
had
thee
would
not
talk
of
the
abuses
of
slavery
when
the
system
is
an
abuse
itself
i
am
afraid
thee
has
never
gauged
the
depth
of
its
wickedness
thy
face
looks
too
honest
and
frank
to
defend
this
system
from
conviction
has
thee
ever
examined
it
why
no
i
have
always
been
used
to
it
louis
who
liked
the
honest
bluntness
of
the
quaker
would
have
willingly
prolonged
the
conversation
simply
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
but
just
then
minnie
entered
holding
in
her
hand
a
bunch
of
flowers
and
started
to
show
them
to
her
father
before
she
perceived
that
any
company
was
in
the
room
oh
father
said
she
see
what
i
have
brought
you
when
her
eye
fell
upon
the
visitors
and
a
bright
flush
overspread
her
cheek
lending
it
additional
beauty
charles
immediately
arose
and
giving
her
his
hand
introduced
her
to
his
friend
i
am
glad
to
see
you
minnie
you
are
looking
so
well
this
summer
said
charles
gazing
on
her
with
unfeigned
admiration
i
am
glad
you
think
so
said
she
with
charming
frankness
some
business
having
called
friend
carpenter
from
the
room
the
young
people
had
a
pleasant
time
to
themselves
talking
of
books
poetry
and
the
current
literature
of
the
day
although
being
students
their
acquaintance
with
these
things
was
somewhat
limited
by
the
time
they
were
ready
to
go
thomas
had
the
room
and
bidding
them
cordially
invited
them
to
return
again
what
do
you
think
of
her
said
charles
to
his
friend
beautiful
as
a
dream
the
half
had
not
been
told
her
pays
me
for
my
trip
yes
i
would
like
to
become
better
acquainted
with
her
there
was
such
a
charming
simplicity
about
her
and
such
unaffected
grace
that
i
am
really
delighted
with
her
how
is
it
that
you
have
never
fallen
in
love
with
her
oh
i
have
left
that
for
you
but
in
fact
we
have
almost
grown
together
played
with
each
other
when
we
were
children
until
she
appears
like
one
of
our
family
and
to
marry
her
would
be
like
marrying
my
own
sister
how
does
thee
like
charles
friend
said
minnie
to
her
adopted
father
thomas
spoke
slowly
and
deliberately
and
said
he
impresses
me
rather
favorably
i
think
there
the
making
of
a
man
in
him
but
i
hear
that
he
is
yes
he
is
but
i
think
that
is
simply
the
result
of
former
associations
and
surroundings
i
do
not
believe
that
he
has
looked
deeper
than
the
surface
of
slavery
he
is
quite
young
yet
his
reflective
faculties
are
hardly
fully
awakened
i
believe
the
time
will
come
when
he
will
see
it
in
its
true
light
and
if
he
joins
our
ranks
he
will
be
an
important
accession
to
our
cause
i
have
great
hopes
of
him
he
seems
to
be
generous
and
full
of
good
impulses
and
i
believe
there
are
grand
possibilities
in
his
nature
how
do
you
like
him
oh
i
was
much
pleased
with
him
we
had
a
very
pleasant
time
together
in
a
few
days
charles
and
louis
called
again
minnie
was
crocheting
and
her
adopted
mother
was
occupied
with
sewing
while
thomas
engaged
them
in
conversation
the
subject
being
the
impending
conflict
louis
taking
a
decided
stand
in
favor
of
the
south
and
thomas
being
equally
strong
in
his
defense
of
the
north
the
conversation
was
very
animated
but
temperate
and
when
they
parted
each
felt
confident
of
the
rightfulness
of
his
position
come
again
said
thomas
as
they
were
leaving
we
ca
see
eye
to
eye
but
i
like
to
have
thee
come
louis
was
very
much
pleased
with
the
invitation
for
it
gave
him
opportunity
to
see
minnie
and
sometimes
she
would
smile
or
say
a
word
or
two
when
the
discussion
was
beginning
to
verge
on
the
borders
of
excitement
the
time
to
return
to
college
was
drawing
near
and
louis
longed
to
tell
her
how
dear
she
was
to
him
but
he
never
met
her
alone
she
was
so
young
he
did
not
like
to
ask
the
privilege
of
writing
to
her
and
yet
he
felt
when
he
left
the
village
that
it
would
afford
him
great
satisfaction
to
hear
from
her
he
once
hinted
to
friend
carpenter
that
he
would
like
to
hear
from
his
family
and
that
if
he
was
too
busy
perhaps
miss
minnie
might
find
time
to
drop
a
line
but
thomas
did
not
take
the
hint
so
the
matter
ended
he
hoping
in
the
meantime
to
meet
her
again
and
renew
their
very
pleasant
acquaintance

is
minnie
not
well
said
thomas
carpenter
entering
one
morning
the
pleasant
room
where
anna
was
labelling
some
preserves
she
seems
to
be
so
drooping
and
scarcely
eats
anything
i
do
know
i
have
not
heard
her
complain
perhaps
she
is
a
little
tired
and
jaded
from
her
journey
and
then
i
think
she
studies
too
much
she
spends
most
of
her
time
in
her
room
and
since
i
think
of
it
she
does
appear
more
quiet
than
usual
but
i
have
been
so
busy
about
my
preserves
that
i
have
not
noticed
her
particularly
anna
said
thomas
suddenly
after
a
moment
pause
does
thee
think
that
there
is
any
attachment
between
louis
and
minnie
he
was
very
attentive
to
her
when
we
were
in
boston
why
thomas
i
have
never
thought
anything
about
it
minnie
always
seems
so
much
like
a
child
that
i
never
get
her
associated
in
my
mind
with
courtship
and
marriage
i
suppose
i
ought
to
though
said
anna
with
the
faintest
sigh
anna
i
think
that
something
is
preying
on
that
child
mind
and
mother
thee
knows
that
you
women
understand
how
to
manage
these
things
better
than
we
men
do
and
i
wish
thee
would
find
out
what
is
the
matter
with
the
child
try
to
find
out
if
there
is
anything
between
her
and
louis
and
if
there
is
by
all
means
we
must
let
her
know
about
herself
it
is
a
duty
we
owe
her
and
him
well
thomas
if
we
must
we
must
but
i
shrink
from
it
here
she
comes
now
i
leave
in
a
few
minutes
and
then
thee
can
tell
her
perhaps
thee
can
do
it
better
than
i
can
what
makes
thee
look
so
serious
said
thomas
as
minnie
entered
the
room
do
i
father
yes
thee
looks
sober
as
a
judge
what
has
happened
to
disturb
thee
nothing
in
particular
only
i
was
down
to
hickman
this
morning
and
they
have
a
colored
woman
stopping
with
them
she
is
a
very
interesting
and
intelligent
woman
and
she
was
telling
us
part
of
her
history
and
it
was
very
interesting
but
mother
i
do
think
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
be
a
colored
person
in
this
country
how
i
should
suffer
if
i
knew
that
i
was
hated
and
despised
for
what
i
could
help
oh
it
must
be
dreadful
to
be
colored
oh
do
talk
so
minnie
god
never
makes
any
mistakes
i
know
that
mother
but
mother
it
must
be
hard
to
be
forced
to
ride
in
smoking
cars
to
be
insulted
in
the
different
thoroughfares
of
travel
to
be
denied
access
to
public
resorts
in
some
places
such
as
lectures
theatres
concerts
and
even
have
a
particular
seat
assigned
in
the
churches
and
sometimes
feel
you
were
an
object
of
pity
even
to
your
best
friends
i
know
that
heston
felt
so
when
she
was
telling
her
story
for
when
hickman
said
sarah
i
really
pity
you
i
saw
her
dark
eyes
flash
and
she
has
really
beautiful
eyes
as
she
said
is
not
pity
we
want
it
is
justice
in
the
first
place
mother
she
is
a
widow
with
five
children
she
had
six
one
died
in
the
army
and
she
had
some
business
in
washington
connected
with
him
she
says
she
was
born
in
virginia
and
had
one
little
girl
there
but
as
she
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
her
child
growing
up
in
ignorance
she
left
the
south
and
went
to
albany
her
husband
was
a
barber
and
was
doing
a
good
business
there
she
was
living
in
a
very
good
neighborhood
and
sent
her
child
to
the
nearest
district
school
after
her
little
girl
had
been
there
awhile
her
teacher
told
her
she
must
go
home
and
not
come
there
any
more
and
sent
her
mother
a
note
the
child
did
not
know
what
she
had
done
she
had
been
attentive
to
her
lessons
and
had
not
behaved
amiss
and
she
was
puzzled
to
know
why
she
was
turned
out
of
school
i
hated
to
tell
heston
said
the
teacher
the
child
insisted
and
i
knew
that
it
must
come
sooner
or
later
and
so
said
she
i
told
her
it
was
because
she
was
colored
that
all
poor
child
she
did
know
that
in
that
fact
lay
whole
volumes
of
insult
outrage
and
violence
i
made
up
my
mind
she
continued
that
i
would
leave
the
place
and
when
my
husband
came
home
i
said
let
us
leave
this
place
let
us
go
farther
west
i
hear
that
we
can
have
our
child
educated
there
just
the
same
as
any
other
child
at
first
my
husband
demurred
for
we
were
doing
a
good
business
but
i
said
let
us
go
if
we
have
to
live
on
potatoes
and
salt
true
it
was
some
pecuniary
loss
but
i
never
regretted
it
although
i
have
been
pretty
near
the
potatoes
and
salt
my
husband
died
but
i
kept
my
children
together
and
stood
over
the
day
after
day
to
keep
them
at
school
my
oldest
daughter
graduated
at
the
high
school
and
was
quite
a
favorite
with
the
teachers
one
term
there
was
a
vacancy
in
her
room
caused
by
the
resignation
of
one
of
the
assistant
teachers
and
the
first
teacher
had
the
privilege
of
selecting
her
assistants
from
the
graduates
of
the
high
school
their
appointment
of
course
being
subject
to
the
decision
of
the
commissioner
of
public
schools
teacher
having
heard
that
she
was
connected
by
blood
with
one
of
the
first
families
of
virginia
told
the
commissioner
that
she
had
chosen
an
assistant
a
young
lady
of
high
qualifications
and
as
she
understood
a
descendant
of
patrick
henry
indeed
said
the
commissioner
did
know
that
we
had
one
of
that
family
among
us
by
all
means
employ
her
but
as
she
was
about
to
leave
she
said
forgot
to
tell
you
one
thing
she
is
colored
a
sudden
change
came
over
him
and
he
said
you
think
i
would
have
you
walk
down
the
street
with
a
colored
woman
of
course
not
i
never
give
my
consent
to
and
there
the
matter
ended
and
then
she
made
us
feel
so
indignant
when
she
told
us
that
on
her
way
to
washington
to
get
her
son
pension
she
stopped
in
philadelphia
and
the
conductor
tried
to
make
her
leave
the
car
and
because
she
would
not
he
ran
the
car
off
the
track
oh
father
said
she
turning
to
thomas
how
wicked
and
cruel
this
prejudice
oh
how
i
should
hate
to
be
colored
anna
and
thomas
exchanged
mournful
glances
their
hearts
were
too
full
and
as
minnie
left
the
room
thomas
said
not
now
anna
not
just
yet
and
so
minnie
was
permitted
to
return
again
to
school
with
the
secret
untold
minnie

short
time
she
had
beautifully
arranged
minnie

a
profusion
of
curls

what
i
was
thinking
said
carrie
gazing
admiringly
upon
her
friend
you
look
so
much
like
a
picture
i
have
seen
of
yours
in
your
father
album
he
was
showing
me
a
number
of
pictures
which
represent
you
at
different
ages
and
the
one
i
refer
to
he
said
was
our
minnie
when
she
was
five
years
old
now
let
me
put
on
your
hat
and
let
me
kiss
you
for

carrie

idea

so
full
of
nonsense

way
will
we
go
first
first
down
to
carruther

saw
a
beautiful
collar
there
i
liked
so
much
and
then
let
us
go
down
to
barguay
i
want
to
show
you
a
love
of
a
bonnet
one
of
the
sweetest
little
things
in
ribbon
lace
and
flowers
i
ever
saw
equipped
for
the
journey
the
two
friends
sauntered
down
the
street
as
they
were
coming
out
of
a
store
carrie
stopped
for
a
moment
to
speak
to
a
very
dear
friend
of
her
mother
and
minnie
passed
on
as
she
went
slowly
on
loitering
for
her
friend
she
saw
a
woman
approaching
her
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
there
was
something
in
her
look
and
manner
which
arrested
the
attention
of
minnie
she
was
a
tall
slender
woman
about
thirty
five
years
old
with
a
pale
face
a
face
which
told
that
sorrow
had
pressed
her
more
than
years
a
few
threads
of
silver
mingled
with
the
wealth
of
her
raven
hair
and
her
face
though
wearing
a
sad
and
weary
expression
still
showed
traces
of
great
beauty
as
soon
as
her
eyes
fell
on
minnie
she
raised
her
hands
in
sudden
wonder
and
clasping
her
in
her
arms
exclaimed
heaven
is
merciful
i
have
found
you
at
last
my
dear
darling
child
minnie
is
this
you
and
have
i
found
you
at
last
minnie
trembled
from
head
to
foot
a
deadly
pallor
overspread
her
cheek
and
she
stood
still
as
if
rooted
to
the
ground
in
silent
amazement
while
the
woman
stood
anxiously
watching
her
as
if
her
future
were
hanging
on
the
decision
of
her
lips
who
are
you
and
where
did
you
come
from
said
minnie
as
soon
as
she
gained
her
breath
i
came
from
louisiana
oh
i
ca
be
mistaken
i
have
longed
for
you
and
prayed
for
you
and
now
i
have
found
you
just
then
carrie
who
had
finished
speaking
with
her
friend
seeing
minnie
and
the
strange
woman
talking
together
exclaimed
what
is
the
matter
noticing
the
agitation
of
her
friend
who
is
this
woman
and
what
has
she
said
to
you
she
says
that
she
is
my
mother
my
mother
why
minnie
what
nonsense
she
ca
be
your
mother
why
do
you
see
she
is
colored
where
do
you
live
said
minnie
without
appearing
to
notice
the
words
of
carrie
i
do
live
anywhere
i
just
came
here
yesterday
with
some
of
the
union
soldiers
come
with
me
then
and
i
will
show
you
a
place
to
stop
why
minnie
you
are
not
going
to
walk
down
the
street
with
that
nig
colored
woman
if
you
are
please
excuse
me
my
business
calls
me
another
way
and
without
any
more
ceremony
carrie
and
minnie
parted
silently
she
walked
by
the
side
of
the
stranger
a
thousand
thoughts
revolving
in
her
mind
was
this
the
solution
of
the
mystery
which
enshrouded
her
young
life
did
she
indeed
belong
to
that
doomed
and
hated
race
and
must
she
share
the
cruel
treatment
which
bitter
relentless
prejudice
had
assigned
them
thomas
carpenter
and
anna
were
stopping
in
at
the
house
of
relatives
who
knew
minnie
history
but
who
had
never
made
any
difference
in
their
treatment
of
her
on
that
account
is
father
and
mother
at
home
said
minnie
to
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
she
answered
in
the
affirmative
tell
them
to
come
into
the
parlor
they
are
wanted
immediately
sit
down
said
minnie
to
the
stranger
handing
her
a
chair
and
wait
till
father
comes
anna
and
thomas
soon
entered
the
room
and
minnie
approaching
them
said
father
this
woman
met
me
on
the
street
and
says
she
is
my
mother
you
know
all
about
my
history
tell
me
if
there
is
any
truth
in
this
story
i
do
know
minnie
i
never
saw
thy
mother
but
question
her
father
and
see
if
there
is
any
truth
in
what
she
says
but
tell
me
first
father
am
i
white
or
colored
minnie
i
believe
there
is
a
small
portion
of
colored
blood
in
thy
veins
it
is
enough
said
minnie
drawing
closer
to
the
strange
woman
what
makes
you
think
that
i
am
your
child
by
this
said
she
taking
a
miniature
from
her
bosom
by
this
which
i
carried
next
to
my
heart
for
more
than
twelve
years
and
never
have
been
without
it
a
single
day
or
night
thomas
looked
upon
the
miniature
it
was
an
exact
likeness
of
minnie
when
she
first
came
to
them
and
although
she
had
grown
and
changed
since
the
likeness
was
taken
there
was
too
close
a
resemblance
between
it
and
one
which
had
been
taken
soon
after
she
came
for
him
to
doubt
that
minnie
was
the
original
of
that
likeness
thomas
questioned
the
woman
very
closely
but
her
history
and
narrative
corresponded
so
well
with
what
he
had
heard
of
minnie
mother
that
he
could
not
for
a
moment
doubt
that
this
was
she
and
as
such
he
was
willing
to
give
her
the
shelter
of
his
home
till
he
could
make
other
arrangements
but
why
said
anna
somewhat
grieved
at
the
shock
that
minnie
had
received
did
thee
startle
her
by
so
suddenly
claiming
her
in
the
street
would
it
not
have
been
better
for
thee
to
have
waited
and
found
out
where
she
lived
and
then
discovered
thyself
to
her
it
would
said
ellen
very
meekly
and
sorrowfully
but
when
i
saw
her
and
heard
the
young
lady
say
minnie
wait
a
minute
i
forgot
everything
but
that
this
was
my
child
i
am
sorry
if
i
did
any
harm
but
i
was
so
glad
i
could
not
help
it
my
heart
was
so
hungry
for
my
child
yes
yes
said
anna
sadly
i
understand
thee
it
was
the
voice
of
nature
minnie
was
too
nervous
and
excited
to
return
to
her
school
that
day
the
next
morning
she
had
a
very
high
fever
and
thomas
concluded
it
would
be
better
to
take
her
home
and
have
her
mother
accompany
her
and
so
on
monday
morning
anna
and
thomas
left
taking
minnie
and
her
mother
along
once
again
in
her
pleasant
home
surrounded
by
the
tenderest
care
for
her
mother
watched
over
her
with
the
utmost
solicitude
the
violence
of
her
fever
abated
but
it
was
succeeded
by
a
low
nervous
affection
which
while
it
produced
no
pain
yet
it
slowly
unstrung
her
vitality
ellen
hovered
around
her
pillow
as
if
she
begrudged
every
moment
that
called
her
from
her
daughter
side
and
never
seemed
so
well
contented
as
when
she
was
performing
for
her
some
office
of
love
and
tenderness
a
skilful
nurse
she
knew
how
to
prepare
the
most
delicate
viands
to
tempt
the
failing
appetite
and
she
had
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
seeing
her
care
and
attention
rewarded
by
the
returning
health
and
strength
of
her
child
one
morning
as
she
grew
stronger
and
was
able
to
sit
in
her
chair
she
turned
her
eyes
tenderly
towards
ellen
and
said
mother
come
and
sit
near
me
and
let
me
hold
your
hand
mother
oh
how
welcome
was
that
word
ellen
eyes
filled
with
sudden
tears
mother
she
said
it
comes
back
to
me
like
a
dream
i
have
a
faint
recollection
of
having
seen
you
before
but
it
is
so
long
i
can
scarcely
remember
it
tell
me
all
about
myself
and
how
i
came
to
leave
you
i
always
thought
that
there
was
some
mystery
about
me
but
i
never
knew
what
it
was
before
but
now
i
understand
it
darling
said
the
mother
you
had
better
wait
till
you
get
a
little
stronger
and
then
i
will
tell
you
all
very
well
said
minnie
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
and
i
am
beginning
to
love
you
so
much
it
was
touching
to
see
the
ripening
love
between
those
two
ones
ellen
would
comb
minnie
hair
and
do
for
her
every
office
in
her
power
still
minnie
continued
feeble
the
suffering
occasioned
by
her
refusal
of
louis
the
hard
study
and
deep
excitement
through
which
she
had
passed
told
sadly
upon
her
constitution
but
she
was
young
and
having
a
large
share
of
recuperative
power
she
slowly
came
back
to
health
and
strength
and
when
the
spring
opened
thomas
decided
that
she
should
return
again
to
her
school
in
chapter
xii
let
us
now
return
to
carrie
wise
whom
we
left
parting
with
minnie
where
is
minnie
said
two
of
her
schoolmates
who
observed
that
carrie
had
come
home
alone
oh
said
she
one
of
the
strangest
things
i
ever
heard
of
happened
well
what
was
it
said
the
girls
and
by
this
time
they
had
joined
another
group
of
girls
why
this
morning
minnie
and
i
walked
out
shopping
and
just
as
i
came
out
of
carruthers
i
met
an
old
friend
of
mother
and
stopped
to
speak
with
her
and
i
said
just
wait
a
minute
she
passed
on
and
left
me
talking
with
jackson
when
i
joined
her
i
found
a
colored
woman
talking
to
her
and
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
and
just
as
pale
as
a
ghost
and
i
said
minnie
what
is
the
matter
she
gasped
for
breath
and
i
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
and
i
got
real
scared
and
what
do
you
think
minnie
said
why
she
said
carrie
this
woman
says
she
my
mother
her
mother
cried
a
half
dozen
voices
why
you
said
she
was
colored
well
so
she
was
she
was
quite
light
but
i
knew
she
was
colored
how
did
you
know
maybe
she
was
only
a
very
white
woman
oh
no
she
was
i
know
white
people
from
colored
i
seen
enough
of
them
a
colored
woman
well
that
is
very
strange
but
do
tell
us
what
minnie
said
she
asked
her
where
she
came
from
and
where
she
lived
she
said
she
came
in
yesterday
with
the
union
soldiers
and
that
she
had
come
from
louisiana
and
then
minnie
told
her
to
come
with
her
and
she
would
find
a
place
for
her
to
stop
and
did
she
leave
you
in
the
street
to
walk
with
a
nigger
said
a
coarse
girl
yes
and
so
i
left
her
i
was
going
to
walk
down
the
street
with
them
well
did
i
ever
said
a
pale
and
girl
that
is
just
as
strange
as
a
romance
i
have
been
reading
well
they
say
truth
is
stranger
than
fiction
a
deceitful
thing
to
try
to
pass
for
white
when
she
is
colored
if
she
comes
back
to
this
school
i
sha
stay
said
the
coarse
rough
girl
twirling
her
gold
pencil
i
ai
a
going
to
sit
alongside
of
niggers
how
you
talk
i
do
see
that
if
the
woman
is
minnie
mother
and
colored
it
makes
any
difference
in
her
i
am
sure
it
does
not
to
me
said
one
of
minnie
friends
well
it
does
to
me
said
another
you
may
put
yourself
on
an
equality
with
niggers
but
i
wo
and
i
neither
chimed
in
another
voice
there
are
plenty
of
colored
schools
let
her
go
to
them
oh
girls
i
think
it
real
cruel
the
way
you
talk
how
would
you
like
any
one
to
treat
you
so
ca
help
it
i
ai
a
coming
to
school
with
a
nigger
she
is
just
as
good
as
you
are
mary
patuck
and
a
great
deal
smarter
i
do
care
she
a
nigger
and
that
enough
for
me
and
so
the
sentiment
of
the
school
was
divided
some
were
in
favor
of
treating
her
just
as
well
as
usual
and
others
felt
like
complaining
to
their
parents
that
a
negro
was
in
school
at
last
the
news
reached
the
teacher
and
he
poor
weak
and
vacillating
man
had
not
manhood
enough
to
defend
her
but
acted
according
to
the
prejudices
of
society
and
wrote
thomas
a
note
telling
him
that
circumstances
made
it
desirable
that
she
should
not
again
come
to
school
in
the
meantime
the
news
had
reached
their
quiet
little
village
and
of
course
it
offered
food
for
gossip
it
was
discussed
over
and
in
the
sewing
circle
some
concluded
that
thomas
should
have
brought
her
up
among
the
colored
people
and
others
that
he
did
perfectly
right
still
there
was
a
change
in
minnie
social
relations
some
were
just
as
kind
as
ever
others
grew
distant
and
some
avoided
having
anything
to
say
to
her
and
stopped
visiting
the
house
anna
and
thomas
although
superior
people
were
human
and
could
not
help
feeling
the
difference
but
some
business
of
importance
connected
with
the
death
of
a
relative
called
thomas
abroad
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
take
anna
and
minnie
with
him
hoping
that
the
voyage
and
change
of
scene
would
be
beneficial
to
his
little
girl
as
he
still
called
minnie
and
so
on
a
bright
and
beautiful
morning
in
the
spring
of
he
left
the
country
for
a
journey
to
england
and
the
continent
let
us
now
return
to
louis
le
croix
whom
we
left
disappointed
and
wounded
by
minnie
refusal
after
he
left
her
he
entered
his
room
and
sat
for
a
long
time
in
silent
thought
at
last
he
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
and
stood
with
his
hands
clenched
and
his
finely
chiseled
lips
firmly
set
as
if
he
had
bound
his
whole
soul
to
some
great
resolve
a
resolve
which
he
would
accomplish
let
it
cost
what
it
might
and
so
he
had
for
he
had
made
up
in
his
mind
within
the
last
two
hours
that
he
would
join
the
confederacy
that
live
or
die
sink
or
swim
survive
or
perish
he
would
unite
his
fortunes
to
her
destiny
his
next
step
then
was
to
plan
how
he
could
reach
louisiana
he
felt
confident
that
if
he
could
get
as
far
as
louisville
he
could
manage
to
get
into
tennessee
and
from
thence
to
louisiana
and
so
nothing
daunted
by
difficulties
and
dangers
he
set
out
on
his
journey
and
being
aided
by
rebels
on
his
way
in
a
few
weeks
he
reached
the
old
plantation
on
red
river
he
found
his
sister
and
miriam
there
both
glad
to
see
him
camilla
husband
was
in
charleston
some
of
the
slaves
had
deserted
to
the
union
ranks
but
the
greater
portion
she
still
retained
with
her
miriam
was
delighted
to
see
louis
and
seemed
never
weary
of
admiring
his
handsome
face
and
manly
form
and
louis
who
had
never
known
any
other
mother
seemed
really
gratified
by
her
little
kindnesses
and
attention
but
of
course
the
pleasant
and
quiet
monotony
of
home
did
not
suit
the
restless
and
disquieted
spirit
of
louis
all
the
young
men
around
here
were
in
the
army
or
deeply
interested
in
its
success
there
was
a
call
for
more
volunteers
and
a
new
company
was
to
be
raised
in
that
locality
louis
immediately
joined
and
turned
his
trained
intellect
to
the
study
of
military
tactics
day
and
night
he
was
absorbed
in
this
occupation
and
soon
although
minnie
was
not
forgotten
the
enthusiasm
of
his
young
life
gathered
around
the
confederate
cause
he
did
not
give
himself
much
time
to
reflect
thought
was
painful
to
him
and
he
continued
to
live
in
a
whirl
of
excitement
news
of
battle
tidings
of
victory
and
defeats
the
situation
of
the
armies
and
the
hopes
and
fears
that
clustered
around
those
fearful
days
of
struggle
made
the
staple
of
conversation
louis
rapidly
rose
in
favor
with
the
young
volunteers
and
was
chosen
captain
of
a
company
who
were
permitted
to
drill
and
stay
from
the
front
as
a
reserve
corps
ready
to
be
summoned
at
any
moment
chapter
xiii
miriam
and
camilla
watched
with
anguish
louis
devotion
to
the
confederation
and
many
sorrowful
conversations
they
had
about
it
at
last
one
day
miriam
said
miss
camilla
i
can
stand
it
no
longer
that
boy
is
going
to
lift
his
hand
agin
his
own
people
and
i
ca
stand
it
no
longer
got
to
tell
him
all
about
it
i
just
think
i
bust
in
two
if
i
did
tell
him
well
mammy
said
camilla
i
rather
he
should
know
it
than
that
he
should
go
against
his
country
and
raise
his
hand
against
the
dear
old
flag
it
not
the
flag
nor
the
country
i
care
for
said
miriam
but
it
is
that
one
of
my
own
flesh
and
blood
should
jine
with
these
secesh
agin
his
own
people
well
miriam
if
you
get
a
chance
you
can
tell
him
get
a
chance
miss
camilla
bound
to
get
that
louis
was
somewhat
reticent
about
his
plans
for
he
knew
that
camilla
was
a
strong
union
woman
that
she
not
only
loved
the
flag
but
she
had
taught
her
two
boys
to
do
the
same
but
he
understood
from
headquarters
that
his
company
was
to
march
in
a
week
and
although
on
that
subject
there
was
no
common
sympathy
between
them
yet
he
felt
that
he
must
acquaint
her
with
his
plans
and
bid
her
and
miriam
so
one
morning
he
came
in
looking
somewhat
flushed
and
excited
and
said
sister
we
have
got
our
marching
orders
we
leave
on
thursday
and
i
have
only
three
days
to
be
with
you
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
seen
so
little
of
you
but
my
country
calls
me
and
when
she
is
in
danger
it
is
no
time
for
me
to
seek
for
either
ease
or
pleasure
your
country
louis
said
miriam
her
face
paling
and
flushing
by
turns
where
is
your
country
here
said
he
somewhat
angrily
in
louisiana
my
country
said
camilla
is
the
whole
union
yes
louis
said
she
your
country
is
in
danger
but
not
from
the
abolitionists
in
the
north
but
from
the
rebels
and
traitors
in
the
south
rebels
and
traitors
said
louis
in
a
tone
like
one
who
felt
the
harsh
grating
of
the
words
whom
do
you
mean
i
mean
said
she
the
ambitious
reckless
men
who
have
brought
about
this
state
of
things
the
men
who
are
stabbing
their
country
in
their
madness
and
folly
who
are
crowding
our
graves
and
darkening
our
homes
who
are
dragging
our
young
men
men
like
you
who
should
be
the
pride
and
hope
of
our
country
into
the
jaws
of
ruin
and
death
louis
looked
surprised
and
angry
he
had
never
seen
camilla
under
such
deep
excitement
her
words
had
touched
his
pride
and
roused
his
anger
but
suppressing
his
feelings
he
answered
her
coolly
camilla
i
am
old
enough
to
do
my
own
thinking
we
had
better
drop
this
subject
it
is
not
pleasant
to
either
of
us
louis
said
she
her
whole
manner
changing
from
deep
excitement
to
profound
grief
oh
louis
it
will
never
do
for
you
to
go
oh
no
you
must
not
and
why
not
because
and
she
hesitated
just
then
miriam
took
up
the
unfinished
sentence
because
to
join
the
secesh
is
to
raise
your
hands
agin
your
own
race
my
own
race
and
louis
laughed
scornfully
i
think
you
are
talking
more
wildly
than
camilla
what
do
you
mean
miriam
i
mean
said
she
stung
by
his
scornful
words
i
mean
that
you
louis
le
croix
white
as
you
look
are
colored
and
that
you
are
my
own
daughter
child
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
miss
camilla
who
been
such
an
angel
to
you
that
you
would
have
been
a
slave
and
then
you
would
have
been
a
confederate
at
these
words
a
look
of
horror
and
anguish
passed
over
the
face
of
le
croix
and
he
turned
to
camilla
but
she
was
deadly
pale
and
trembling
like
an
aspen
leaf
but
her
eyes
were
dry
and
tearless
camilla
said
he
turning
fiercely
to
his
adopted
sister
tell
me
is
there
any
truth
in
these
words
you
are
as
pale
as
death
and
trembling
like
a
leaf
tell
me
if
there
is
any
truth
in
these
words
turning
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
miriam
who
stood
like
some
ancient
prophetess
her
lips
pronouncing
some
fearful
doom
while
she
watched
in
breathless
anguish
the
effect
upon
the
fated
victim
yes
louis
said
camilla
in
a
voice
almost
choked
by
emotion
yes
louis
it
is
all
true
but
how
is
this
that
i
never
heard
it
before
before
i
believe
this
tale
i
must
have
some
proof
clear
as
daylight
bring
me
proofs
here
they
are
said
miriam
drawing
from
her
pocket
the
free
papers
she
had
been
carrying
about
her
person
for
several
days
louis
grasped
them
nervously
hastily
read
them
and
then
more
slowly
like
one
who
might
read
a
sentence
of
death
to
see
if
there
was
one
word
or
sentence
on
which
he
might
hang
a
hope
of
reprieve
camilla
watched
him
anxiously
but
silently
and
when
he
had
finished
he
covered
his
bowed
face
with
his
hands
as
he
said
with
a
deep
groan
it
is
true
too
true
i
see
it
all
i
can
never
raise
my
hand
against
my
mother
race
he
arose
like
one
in
a
dream
walked
slowly
to
the
door
and
left
the
room
it
was
a
painful
task
said
camilla
with
a
sigh
of
relief
as
if
a
burden
had
fallen
from
her
soul
yes
said
miriam
but
not
so
bad
as
to
see
him
fighting
agin
his
own
color
i
rather
follow
him
to
his
grave
than
see
him
join
that
miserable
secesh
crew
yes
said
camilla
it
was
better
than
letting
him
go
when
louis
left
the
room
a
thousand
conflicting
thoughts
passed
through
his
mind
he
felt
as
a
mariner
at
midnight
on
a
moonless
sea
who
suddenly
when
the
storm
is
brewing
finds
that
he
has
lost
his
compass
and
his
chart
chapter
xiv
where
was
he
steering
and
now
the
course
of
his
life
was
changed
what
kind
of
future
must
he
make
for
himself
had
it
been
in
time
of
peace
he
could
have
easily
decided
as
he
had
a
large
amount
of
money
in
the
north
which
his
father
left
him
when
he
came
of
age
he
would
have
no
difficulty
as
to
choosing
the
means
of
living
for
he
was
well
supplied
as
far
as
that
was
concerned
but
here
was
a
most
unpleasant
dilemma
in
which
he
had
placed
himself
convinced
that
he
was
allied
to
the
negro
race
his
whole
soul
rose
up
against
the
idea
of
laying
one
straw
in
its
way
if
he
belonged
to
the
race
he
would
not
join
its
oppressors
and
yet
his
whole
sympathy
had
been
so
completely
with
them
that
he
felt
that
he
had
no
feeling
in
common
with
the
north
and
as
to
the
colored
people
of
course
it
never
entered
his
mind
to
join
their
ranks
and
ally
himself
to
them
he
had
always
regarded
them
as
inferior
and
this
sudden
and
unwelcome
revelation
had
not
changed
the
whole
tenor
of
his
thoughts
and
opinions
but
what
he
had
to
do
must
be
done
quickly
for
in
less
than
three
days
his
company
would
start
for
the
front
to
desert
was
to
face
death
to
remain
was
to
wed
dishonor
he
surveyed
the
situation
calmly
and
bravely
and
then
resolved
that
he
would
face
the
perils
of
rather
than
the
contempt
of
his
own
soul
while
he
was
deciding
he
heard
camilla
step
in
the
passage
he
opened
the
door
and
beckoned
her
to
a
seat
and
said
very
calmly
i
have
been
weighing
the
whole
matter
in
my
mind
and
i
have
concluded
to
leave
the
south
how
can
you
do
it
said
camilla
i
tremble
lest
you
should
be
discovered
oh
slavery
what
a
curse
our
fathers
sowed
the
wind
and
we
are
reaping
the
whirlwind
what
continued
she
as
if
speaking
to
herself
what
are
your
plans
have
you
any
none
except
to
disguise
myself
and
escape
when
as
soon
as
possible
suppose
i
call
miriam
she
can
help
you
shall
i
yes
camilla
called
miriam
and
after
a
few
moments
consultation
it
was
decided
that
louis
should
escape
that
night
and
that
miriam
should
prepare
whatever
was
needed
for
his
hasty
flight
do
trust
your
secret
to
any
white
person
said
miriam
but
if
you
meet
any
of
the
colored
people
just
tell
them
that
you
is
for
the
linkum
soldiers
and
it
will
be
all
right
we
do
know
all
about
this
war
but
we
feels
somehow
we
all
mixed
up
in
it
and
so
with
many
prayers
and
blessings
from
miriam
and
sad
farewells
from
camilla
he
left
his
home
to
enter
upon
that
perilous
flight
the
whole
current
of
his
life
changed
it
was
in
the
early
part
of
winter
but
the
air
was
just
as
pleasant
as
early
spring
in
that
climate
louis
walked
all
that
night
guiding
himself
northward
at
night
by
the
light
of
the
stars
and
a
little
pocket
compass
camilla
had
just
given
him
before
starting
and
avoiding
the
public
roads
during
the
day
and
thus
he
travelled
for
two
days
when
his
lunch
was
exhausted
his
lips
parched
with
thirst
and
his
strength
began
to
fail
just
in
this
hour
of
extremity
he
saw
seated
by
the
corner
of
a
fence
a
very
black
and
woman
there
was
something
so
gloomy
and
sullen
in
her
countenance
that
he
felt
repelled
by
its
morose
expression
still
he
needed
food
and
was
very
weary
and
drawing
near
he
asked
her
if
she
would
give
him
anything
to
eat
ai
got
nothing
de
sojers
done
been
here
and
eat
all
up
louis
drew
near
and
whispered
a
few
words
in
her
ear
and
immediately
a
change
passed
over
her
whole
countenance
the
sullen
expression
turned
to
a
look
of
tenderness
and
concern
the
harsh
tones
of
her
voice
actually
grew
mellow
and
rising
up
in
haste
she
almost
sprang
over
the
fence
and
said
been
looking
for
you
if
you
northman
mighty
welcome
and
she
set
before
him
her
humble
store
of
provisions
do
you
know
said
louis
where
i
will
find
the
lincoln
soldiers
or
where
the
secesh
are
encamped

said
she
but
my
old
man
mighty
smart
and
he
find
out
you
come
wid
me
nothing
doubting
he
went
and
found
the
husband
ready
to
do
anything
in
his
power
to
help
him
you

go
any
furder

get

place
to

then
i
pump
massa
the
sojers
true
to
his
word
he
contrived
to
find
out
whether
the
soldiers
were
near
massa

he
scratching
his
head
and
looking
quite
sober
massa

as

sam
gave
louis
the
desired
information
here
said
sam
when
louis
was
ready
to
start
again
is
something
to
break
your
fast
and
if
you
goes
dis
way
you
mus
let
de
white
folks
know
what
you
up
to
but
you
trust
dis
said
he
laying
his
hand
on
his
own
dark
skin
his
new
friend
went
with
him
several
miles
and
pointing
him
out
the
way
left
him
to
pursue
his
journey
onward
the
next
person
he
met
with
was
a
colored
man
who
bowed
and
smiled
and
took
off
his
hat
louis
returned
the
bow
and
was
passing
on
when
he
said
massa
me
for
speakin
to
you
but
dem
secesh
been
hunting
all
day
for
a
him
captin
dey
say
louis
turned
pale
but
bracing
his
nerves
he
said
where
are
they
dey
in
the
house
is
you
he
i
am
a
union
man
louis
said
and
am
trying
to
reach
the
lincoln
soldiers
den
said
the
man
if
dat
am
de
fac
i
got
a
place
for
you
come
with
me
and
louis
having
learned
to
trust
the
colored
people
followed
him
to
a
place
of
safety
soon
it
was
noised
abroad
that
another
deserter
had
been
seen
in
that
neighborhood
but
the
colored
man
would
not
reveal
the
whereabouts
of
louis
his
master
beat
him
severely
but
he
would
let
neither
threats
nor
torture
wring
the
secret
from
his
lips
louis
saw
the
faithfulness
of
that
man
and
he
thought
with
shame
of
his
former
position
to
the
race
from
whom
such
unswerving
devotion
could
spring
the
hunt
proving
ineffectual
louis
after
the
search
and
excitement
had
subsided
resumed
his
journey
northward
meeting
with
first
one
act
of
kindness
and
then
another
one
day
he
had
a
narrow
escape
from
the
bloodhounds
he
had
trusted
his
secret
to
a
colored
man
who
faithful
like
the
rest
was
directing
him
on
his
way
when
deep
ominous
sounds
fell
on
their
ears
the
colored
man
knew
that
sound
too
well
he
knew
something
of
the
nature
of
bloodhounds
and
how
to
throw
them
off
the
track
so
hastily
opening
his
he
cut
his
own
feet
so
that
the
blood
from
them
might
deepen
the
scent
on
one
track
and
throw
them
off
from
louis
path
it
was
a
brave
deed
and
nobly
done
and
louis
began
to
feel
that
he
had
never
known
them
and
then
how
vividly
came
into
his
mind
the
words
of
charming
after
all
we
may
be
trampling
on
one
of
the
best
branches
of
the
human
race
here
were
men
and
women
too
who
had
been
trampled
on
for
ages
ready
to
break
to
him
their
bread
aye
share
with
him
their
scanty
store
one
had
taken
the
shoes
from
his
feet
and
almost
forced
him
to
take
them
what
was
it
impelled
these
people
what
was
the
union
to
them
and
who
were
lincoln
soldiers
that
they
should
be
so
ready
to
gravitate
to
the
union
army
and
bring
the
most
reliable
information
to
the
american
general
was
it
not
the
hope
of
freedom
which
they
were
binding
as
amulets
around
their
hearts
they
as
a
race
had
lived
in
a
measure
upon
an
idea
it
was
the
hope
of
a
deliverance
yet
to
come
faith
in
god
had
underlain
the
life
of
the
race
and
was
it
strange
if
when
even
some
of
our
politicians
did
not
or
could
not
read
the
signs
of
the
times
aright
these
people
with
deeper
intuitions
understood
the
war
better
than
they
did
but
at
last
louis
got
beyond
the
borders
of
the
confederacy
and
stood
once
more
on
free
soil
appreciating
that
section
as
he
had
never
done
before
chapter
xv
text
missing
chapter
xvi
and
i
said
minnie
will
help
you
pay
it
and
so
their
young
hearts
had
met
at
last
and
with
the
approval
and
hearty
consent
of
anna
minnie
and
louis
were
married
it
was
decided
that
minnie
should
spend
the
winter
in
southern
france
and
then
in
the
spring
they
returned
to
america
on
their
arrival
they
found
the
war
still
raging
and
louis
was
ready
and
anxious
to
benefit
that
race
to
whom
he
felt
he
owed
his
life
and
with
whom
he
was
connected
by
lineage
he
had
plenty
of
money
a
liberal
education
and
could
have
chosen
a
life
of
ease
but
he
was
too
ardent
in
his
temperament
too
decided
in
his
character
not
to
feel
an
interest
in
the
great
events
which
were
then
transpiring
in
the
country
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
some
friends
and
listened
with
avidity
to
their
doctrines
he
attended
a
number
of
war
meetings
and
caught
the
enthusiasm
which
inspired
the
young
men
who
were
coming
from
valley
hill
and
plain
to
fill
up
the
broken
ranks
of
the
union
army
minnie
educated
in
peace
principles
could
not
conscientiously
encourage
him
and
yet
when
she
saw
how
the
liberty
of
a
whole
race
was
trembling
in
the
balance
she
could
not
help
wishing
success
to
the
army
nor
find
it
in
her
heart
to
dissuade
him
from
going
others
had
given
their
loved
and
cherished
ones
to
camp
and
field
the
son
of
a
dear
friend
had
said
to
his
mother
i
know
i
shall
be
killed
but
i
go
to
free
the
slave
his
presentiment
had
been
met
for
he
had
been
brought
home
in
his
shroud
another
dear
friend
had
said
i
have
drawn
my
sword
and
it
shall
never
sleep
in
its
scabbard
till
the
nation
is
free
and
she
had
heard
that
summer
of
how
bravely
the
colored
soldiers
had
stood
at
fort
wagner
when
the
storms
of
death
were
sweeping
through
the
darkened
sky
how
they
summoned
the
world
to
see
the
grandeur
of
their
courage
and
the
daring
of
their
prowess
how
corny
had
held
with
unyielding
hand
the
nation
flag
and
even
when
he
was
wounded
still
held
it
in
his
grasp
and
crawling
from
the
scene
of
action
exclaimed
i
only
did
my
duty
the
old
flag
i
did
let
it
trail
on
the
ground
and
she
felt
on
reading
it
with
tearful
eyes
that
if
she
belonged
to
that
race
they
had
not
shamed
her
by
their
want
of
courage
and
so
when
louis
came
to
her
and
told
her
his
intention
she
would
not
attempt
to
oppose
him
and
when
he
was
ready
to
depart
with
many
prayers
and
sad
farewells
she
gave
him
up
to
fight
the
battles
of
freedom
for
such
it
was
to
him
who
went
with
every
nerve
in
his
right
arm
tingling
to
strike
a
blow
for
liberty
hitherto
louis
had
known
the
race
by
their
tenderness
and
compassion
but
the
war
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
become
acquainted
with
men
brave
to
do
brave
to
dare
and
brave
to
die
a
colored
man
was
the
hero
of
one
of
the
most
tender
touching
and
tragic
incidents
of
the
war
a
number
of
soldiers
were
in
a
boat
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
rebels
on
board
was
a
colored
man
who
had
not
enrolled
as
a
soldier
though
his
soul
was
full
of
sublime
valor
the
bullets
hissed
and
split
the
water
and
the
rowers
tried
to
get
out
of
their
reach
but
all
their
efforts
were
in
vain
the
treacherous
mud
had
caught
the
boat
and
some
one
must
peril
life
and
limb
to
shove
that
boat
into
the
water
and
this
man
the
member
of
a
doomed
a
fated
race
who
had
been
trodden
down
for
ages
comprehending
the
danger
said
some
one
must
die
to
get
us
out
of
this
and
it
mout
well
be
me
as
anybody
you
are
soldiers
and
you
can
fight
if
they
kill
me
it
is
nothing
and
with
these
words
he
arose
gave
the
boat
a
push
received
a
number
of
bullets
and
died
within
two
days
after
louis
acquitted
himself
bravely
and
rapidly
rose
in
favor
with
his
superior
officers
to
him
the
place
of
danger
was
the
post
of
duty
he
often
received
letters
from
minnie
but
they
were
always
hopeful
for
she
had
learned
to
look
on
the
bright
side
of
everything
she
tried
to
beguile
him
with
the
news
of
the
neighborhood
and
to
inspire
him
with
bright
hopes
for
the
future
that
future
in
which
they
should
clasp
hands
again
and
find
their
duty
and
their
pleasure
in
living
for
the
welfare
and
happiness
of
race
as
minnie
would
often
say
a
race
upon
whose
brows
god
had
poured
the
chrism
of
a
new
era
a
race
newly
anointed
with
freedom
oh
how
the
enthusiasm
of
her
young
soul
gathered
around
that
work
she
felt
it
was
no
mean
nor
common
privilege
to
be
the
pioneer
of
a
new
civilization
if
he
who
makes
two
blades
of
grass
grow
where
only
one
flourished
before
is
a
benefactor
of
the
human
race
how
much
higher
and
holier
must
his
or
her
work
be
who
dispenses
light
instead
of
darkness
knowledge
instead
of
ignorance
and
over
the
ruins
of
the
and
erects
institutions
of
learning
she
would
say
in
her
letters
to
louis
that
the
south
will
never
be
rightly
conquered
until
another
army
should
take
the
field
and
that
must
be
an
army
of
civilizers
the
army
of
the
pen
and
not
the
sword
not
the
destroyers
of
towns
and
cities
but
the
builders
of
machines
and
factories
the
organizers
of
peaceful
industry
and
honorable
labor
and
as
soon
as
she
possibly
could
she
intended
to
join
that
great
army
sometimes
louis
would
shake
his
head
doubtfully
and
tell
her
that
the
south
was
a
very
sad
place
to
live
in
and
would
be
for
years
and
while
he
was
willing
to
bear
toil
and
privation
in
the
cause
he
had
learned
to
love
yet
he
shrank
from
exposing
her
to
the
social
ostracism
which
she
must
bear
whether
she
identified
herself
with
the
colored
race
or
not
however
her
brave
young
heart
never
failed
her
but
kept
true
to
its
purpose
to
join
that
noble
band
who
left
the
sunshine
of
their
homes
to
help
build
up
a
new
south
on
the
basis
of
a
higher
and
better
civilization
louis
remained
with
the
army
till
lee
had
surrendered
the
of
battle
had
passed
away
and
the
thunders
of
contending
batteries
no
longer
crashed
and
vibrated
on
the
air
and
then
he
returned
to
minnie
who
still
lived
with
thomas
carpenter
very
tender
and
joyous
was
their
greeting
louis
thought
he
would
rest
awhile
and
then
arrange
his
affairs
to
return
to
the
south
in
this
plan
he
was
heartily
seconded
by
minnie
thomas
and
anna
were
sorry
to
part
with
her
but
they
knew
that
life
was
not
made
for
a
holiday
of
ease
and
luxury
and
so
they
had
no
words
of
discouragement
for
them
if
duty
called
them
to
the
south
it
was
right
that
they
should
go
and
so
they
would
not
throw
themselves
across
the
purpose
of
their
souls
chapter
xvii
before
he
located
louis
concluded
to
visit
the
old
homestead
and
to
present
his
beautiful
young
bride
to
his
grandmother
and
camilla
he
knew
his
adopted
sister
too
well
to
fear
that
minnie
would
fail
to
receive
from
her
the
warmest
welcome
and
so
with
eager
heart
he
took
passage
on
one
of
the
mississippi
boats
to
new
orleans
intending
to
stop
in
the
city
a
few
days
and
send
word
to
camilla
but
just
as
he
was
passing
from
the
levee
to
the
hotel
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
camilla
walking
down
the
street
and
stopping
the
carriage
he
alighted
and
spoke
to
her
she
immediately
recognized
him
although
his
handsome
face
had
become
somewhat
bronzed
by
exposure
in
camp
and
field
do
not
go
to
the
hotel
she
said
you
are
heartily
welcome
come
home
with
me
but
my
wife
is
along
never
mind
she
just
as
welcome
as
you
are
but
like
myself
she
is
colored
it
does
not
matter
i
should
not
think
of
your
going
to
a
hotel
while
i
have
a
home
in
the
city
camilla
following
wondering
how
she
would
like
the
young
wife
she
had
great
kindness
and
compassion
for
the
race
but
as
far
as
social
equality
was
concerned
though
she
had
her
strong
personal
likings
yet
except
with
louis
neither
custom
nor
education
had
reconciled
her
to
the
maintenance
of
any
equal
social
relations
with
them
my
wife
said
louis
introducing
camilla
to
minnie
camilla
immediately
reached
out
her
hand
to
the
young
wife
and
gave
her
a
cordial
greeting
and
they
soon
fell
into
a
pleasant
and
animated
conversation
mutually
they
were
attracted
to
each
other
and
when
they
reached
their
destination
minnie
had
begun
to
feel
quite
at
home
with
camilla
how
is
aunt
miriam
or
rather
my
grandmother
said
louis
she
is
well
and
often
wonders
what
has
become
of
her
poor
boy
but
she
always
has
persisted
in
believing
that
she
would
see
you
again
and
i
know
her
dear
old
eyes
will
run
over
with
gladness
but
things
have
changed
very
much
since
we
parted
we
have
passed
through
the
fire
since
i
saw
you
and
our
troubles
are
not
over
yet
but
we
are
hoping
for
better
days
but
we
are
at
home
let
us
alight
and
louis
and
minnie
were
ushered
into
a
home
whose
quiet
and
refined
beauty
were
very
pleasant
to
the
eye
for
camilla
had
inherited
from
her
father
his
aesthetic
tastes
had
made
her
home
and
its
surroundings
models
of
loveliness
half
a
dozen
varieties
of
the
sweetest
and
brightest
roses
clambered
up
the
walls
and
arrayed
them
with
a
garb
of
rare
beauty
jessamines
breathed
their
fragrance
on
the
air
magnolias
reared
their
stately
heads
and
gladdened
the
eye
with
the
exquisite
beauty
of
their
flowers
this
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
said
camilla
removing
bonnet
and
gazing
with
unfeigned
admiration
upon
her
girlish
face
but
really
some
one
must
enjoy
this
pleasure
besides
myself
camilla
rang
the
bell
a
bright
smiling
girl
of
about
ten
years
appeared
tell
miriam
she
said
to
come
that
her
boy
louis
is
here
miriam
appeared
immediately
and
throwing
her
arms
around
his
neck
gave
vent
to
her
feelings
in
a
burst
of
joy
i
always
said
you
come
back
i
prayed
for
you
night
and
day
and
i
always
believed
i
see
you
afore
i
died
and
now
my
word
come
true
there
nothing
like
having
faith
here
my
wife
said
louis
turning
to
minnie
your
wife
is
you
married
honey
well
i
hopes
you
have
a
good
time
minnie
came
forward
and
gave
her
hand
to
miriam
as
louis
said
this
is
my
grandmother
a
look
of
proud
satisfaction
passed
over
the
old
woman
face
and
a
sudden
joy
lit
up
her
eyes
at
these
words
of
pleasant
recognition
ah
my
child
said
miriam
we
had
a
mighty
heap
of
trouble
since
you
left
them
miserable
secesh
searched
the
house
all
over
for
you
when
you
was
gone
and
they
was
mighty
sassy
but
we
did
mind
that
so
they
did
ketch
you
how
did
you
get
along
we
was
dreadfully
uneasy
about
you
louis
then
told
them
of
the
kindness
of
the
colored
people
his
thrilling
adventures
and
escapes
and
unfolded
to
them
his
plans
for
the
future
camilla
listened
with
deep
interest
and
turning
to
minnie
who
had
left
the
peaceful
sunshine
of
her
mother
home
to
dwell
in
the
midst
of
that
rough
and
rude
state
of
society
she
said
i
can
not
help
feeling
sad
to
see
you
exposing
yourself
to
the
dangers
that
lay
around
your
path
the
few
southern
women
who
have
been
faithful
to
the
flag
have
had
a
sad
experience
since
the
war
we
have
been
ostracized
and
abused
and
often
our
husbands
have
been
brutally
murdered
in
a
number
of
instances
when
they
were
faithful
to
the
dear
old
flag
a
friend
of
mine
who
was
an
angel
of
mercy
to
the
union
prisoners
dressing
their
wounds
and
carrying
them
relief
had
a
dear
son
who
always
kept
a
union
flag
at
home
which
he
regarded
with
almost
religious
devotion
this
made
him
a
marked
boy
in
the
community
and
during
the
war
he
was
so
cruelly
beaten
by
some
young
rebels
that
he
never
recovered
and
colored
women
who
would
wend
their
way
under
the
darkness
and
cover
of
night
to
aid
our
suffering
soldiers
were
in
danger
of
being
flogged
if
detected
and
i
understand
that
one
did
receive
lashes
for
such
an
offence
and
i
heard
of
another
who
was
shot
down
like
a
dog
for
giving
bread
to
a
prisoner
who
said
i
am
starving
i
think
but
i
have
no
right
to
dictate
to
you
had
i
been
you
and
my
home
in
the
north
that
i
would
have
preferred
staying
there
where
to
say
the
least
you
could
have
had
pleasanter
social
relations
you
and
louis
are
nearer
the
white
race
than
the
colored
why
should
you
prefer
the
one
to
the
other
because
said
minnie
the
prejudices
of
society
are
so
strong
against
the
people
with
whom
i
am
connected
on
my
mother
side
that
i
could
not
associate
with
white
people
on
equal
terms
without
concealing
my
origin
and
that
i
scorned
to
do
the
first
years
of
my
life
passed
without
my
knowing
that
i
was
connected
with
the
colored
race
but
when
it
was
revealed
to
me
by
mother
who
suddenly
claimed
me
at
first
i
shrank
from
the
social
ostracism
to
which
that
knowledge
doomed
me
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
was
reconciled
to
the
change
oh
there
are
lessons
of
life
that
we
never
learn
in
the
bowers
of
ease
they
must
be
learned
in
the
fire
for
months
life
seemed
to
me
a
dull
sad
thing
and
for
a
while
i
did
not
care
whether
i
lived
or
died
the
sunshine
had
suddenly
faded
from
my
path
and
the
future
looked
so
dark
and
cheerless
but
now
when
i
look
back
upon
those
days
of
gloom
and
suffering
i
think
they
were
among
the
most
fruitful
of
my
life
for
in
those
days
of
pain
and
sorrow
my
resolution
was
formed
to
join
the
fortunes
of
my
mother
race
and
i
resolved
to
brighten
her
old
age
with
a
joy
with
a
gladness
she
had
never
known
in
her
youth
and
how
could
i
have
done
that
had
i
left
her
unrecognized
and
palmed
myself
upon
society
as
a
white
woman
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
having
passed
most
of
my
life
in
white
society
i
did
not
feel
that
the
advantages
of
that
society
would
have
ever
paid
me
for
the
loss
of
my
by
passing
as
white
when
i
knew
that
i
was
colored
when
i
knew
that
any
society
however
cultivated
wealthy
or
refined
would
not
be
a
social
gain
to
me
if
my
color
and
not
my
character
must
be
my
passport
of
admission
so
when
i
found
out
that
i
was
colored
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
neither
be
pitied
nor
patronized
by
my
former
friends
but
that
i
would
live
out
my
own
individuality
and
do
for
my
race
as
a
colored
woman
what
i
never
could
accomplish
as
a
white
woman
i
think
i
understand
you
said
camilla
and
although
i
tremble
for
you
in
the
present
state
yet
you
can
not
do
better
than
live
out
the
earnest
purpose
of
your
life
i
feel
that
we
owe
a
great
debt
to
the
colored
race
and
i
would
aid
and
not
hinder
any
hand
that
is
ready
to
help
do
the
needed
work
i
have
felt
for
many
years
that
slavery
was
wrong
and
i
am
glad
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
it
has
at
last
been
destroyed
and
what
are
your
plans
louis
we
are
going
to
open
a
school
and
devote
our
lives
to
the
upbuilding
of
the
future
race
i
intend
entering
into
some
plan
to
facilitate
the
freedmen
in
obtaining
homes
of
their
own
i
want
to
see
this
newly
enfranchised
race
adding
its
quota
to
the
civilization
of
the
land
i
believe
there
is
power
and
capacity
only
let
it
have
room
for
exercise
and
development
we
demand
no
social
equality
no
supremacy
of
power
all
we
ask
is
that
the
american
people
will
take
their
christless
godless
prejudices
out
of
the
way
and
give
us
a
chance
to
grow
an
opportunity
to
accept
life
not
merely
as
a
matter
of
ease
and
indulgence
but
of
struggle
conquest
and
achievement
yes
said
camilla
what
you
want
and
what
the
nation
should
be
just
enough
to
grant
you
is
fair
play
yes
that
is
what
we
want
to
be
known
by
our
character
and
not
by
our
color
to
be
permitted
to
take
whatever
position
in
society
we
are
fitted
to
fill
we
do
not
want
to
be
bolstered
and
propped
up
on
the
one
hand
nor
to
be
crushed
and
trampled
down
on
the
other
well
louis
i
think
that
we
are
coming
to
that
no
i
can
not
feel
that
all
this
baptism
of
fire
and
blood
through
which
we
have
passed
has
been
in
vain
slavery
as
an
institution
has
been
destroyed
slavery
as
an
idea
still
lives
but
i
believe
that
we
shall
outgrow
this
spirit
of
caste
and
proscription
which
still
tarnishes
our
civilization
both
north
and
south
chapter
xviii
after
spending
a
few
weeks
with
camilla
louis
resolved
to
settle
in
the
town
of
l
n
and
as
soon
as
he
had
chosen
his
home
and
made
arrangements
for
the
future
he
sent
for
ellen
and
in
a
few
days
she
joined
her
dear
children
as
she
called
louis
and
minnie
very
pleasant
were
the
relations
between
minnie
and
the
newly
freed
people
she
had
found
her
work
and
they
had
found
their
friend
she
did
not
content
herself
with
teaching
them
mere
knowledge
of
books
she
felt
that
if
the
race
would
grow
in
the
right
direction
it
must
plant
the
roots
of
progress
under
the
hearthstone
she
had
learned
from
anna
those
womanly
arts
that
give
beauty
strength
and
grace
to
the
fireside
and
it
was
her
earnest
desire
to
teach
them
how
to
make
their
homes
bright
and
happy
louis
too
with
his
practical
turn
of
mind
used
his
influence
in
teaching
them
to
be
saving
and
industrious
and
to
turn
their
attention
towards
becoming
land
owners
he
attended
their
political
meetings
not
to
array
class
against
class
nor
to
inflame
the
passions
of
either
side
he
wanted
the
vote
of
the
colored
people
not
to
express
the
old
hates
and
animosities
of
the
plantation
but
the
new
community
of
interests
arising
from
freedom
for
awhile
the
aspect
of
things
looked
hopeful
the
reconstruction
act
by
placing
the
vote
in
the
hands
of
the
colored
man
had
given
him
a
new
position
there
was
a
lull
in
southern
violence
it
was
a
great
change
from
the
fetters
on
his
wrist
to
the
ballot
in
his
right
hand
and
the
uniform
testimony
of
the
colored
people
was
we
are
treated
better
than
we
were
before
some
of
the
rebels
indulged
in
the
hope
that
their
former
slaves
would
vote
for
them
but
they
were
learning
the
power
of
combination
and
having
no
political
past
they
were
radical
by
position
and
when
southern
state
after
state
rolled
up
its
majorities
on
the
radical
side
then
the
vials
of
wrath
were
poured
upon
the
heads
of
the
colored
people
and
the
courage
and
heroism
which
might
have
gained
them
recognition
perhaps
among
heathens
made
them
more
obnoxious
here
still
louis
and
minnie
kept
on
their
labors
of
love
their
inner
lives
daily
growing
stronger
and
broader
for
they
learned
to
lean
upon
a
strength
greater
than
their
own
and
some
of
the
most
beautiful
lessons
of
faith
and
trust
they
had
ever
learned
they
were
taught
in
the
lowly
cabins
of
these
newly
freed
people
often
would
minnie
enter
these
humble
homes
and
listen
patiently
to
the
old
story
of
wrong
and
suffering
sympathizing
with
their
lot
she
would
give
them
counsel
and
help
when
needed
when
she
was
leaving
they
would
look
after
her
wistfully
and
say
she
mighty
good
we
low
down
but
she
feels
for
we
and
thus
day
after
day
of
that
earnest
life
was
spent
in
deeds
and
words
of
love
and
kindness
but
let
us
enter
their
pleasant
home
louis
has
just
returned
from
a
journey
to
the
city
and
has
brought
with
him
the
latest
northern
papers
he
is
looking
rather
sober
and
minnie
ready
to
detect
the
least
change
of
his
countenance
is
at
his
side
what
is
the
matter
minnie
asked
in
a
tone
of
deep
concern
i
am
really
discouraged
what
about
look
here
said
he
handing
her
the
york
state
after
state
has
rolled
up
a
majority
against
negro
suffrage
i
have
been
trying
to
persuade
our
people
to
vote
the
republican
ticket
but
i
feel
like
blushing
for
the
party
they
are
weakening
our
hands
and
strengthening
those
of
the
rebels
but
louis
they
were
not
republicans
who
gave
these
majorities
against
us
but
darling
if
large
numbers
of
these
republicans
stayed
at
home
and
let
the
election
go
by
default
the
result
was
just
the
same
now
every
rebel
can
throw
it
in
our
teeth
and
say
your
great
republican
party
they
refuse
to
let
the
negro
vote
with
them
but
they
force
him
upon
us
they
do
do
it
out
of
regard
to
the
negro
but
only
to
spite
us
i
do
think
minnie
that
i
am
much
given
to
gloomy
forebodings
but
i
see
from
the
temper
and
actions
of
these
rebels
that
they
are
encouraged
and
emboldened
by
these
tidings
from
the
north
and
they
are
turning
people
out
of
work
for
voting
the
radical
ticket
a
while
ago
they
tried
flattery
and
cajolery
you
could
hear
it
on
almost
every
side
are
the
best
friends
of
the
colored
people
appeals
were
made
to
the
memories
of
the
past
how
they
hunted
and
played
together
and
searched
for
birds
nests
in
the
rotten
peach
trees
and
when
the
colored
people
were
not
to
be
caught
by
such
chaff
some
were
trying
to
force
them
into
submission
by
intimidation
and
starvation
just
then
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
and
a
dark
man
entered
there
was
nothing
in
his
appearance
that
showed
any
connection
with
the
white
race
there
was
a
tone
of
hopefulness
in
his
speech
though
his
face
wore
a
somewhat
anxious
expression
good
morning
jackson
said
louis
for
in
deference
to
their
feelings
he
had
dropped
the
aunt
and
uncle
of
bygone
days
good
morning
replied
the
man
while
a
pleasant
smile
flitted
over
his
countenance
how
does
the
world
use
you
said
louis
well
times
are
rather
bilious
with
me
but
i
am
beginning
to
pick
up
a
little
i
get
a
few
boots
and
shoes
to
mend
i
always
used
to
go
to
the
mountains
and
get
plenty
of
work
to
do
but
this
year
they
give
me
the
situation
because
i
had
joined
the
radicals
what
a
shame
said
louis
these
men
who
have
always
had
their
rights
of
citizenship
seem
to
know
so
little
of
the
claims
of
justice
and
humanity
that
they
are
ready
to
and
intimidate
these
people
for
voting
according
to
their
best
interests
and
what
saddens
me
most
is
to
see
so
many
people
of
the
north
clasping
hands
with
these
rebels
and
traitors
and
to
hear
it
repeated
that
these
people
are
too
ignorant
to
vote
ignorant
as
they
are
said
minnie
during
the
war
they
knew
more
than
their
masters
for
they
knew
how
to
be
true
to
their
country
when
their
masters
were
false
to
it
and
rallied
around
the
flag
when
they
were
trampling
it
under
foot
and
riddling
it
with
bullets
ah
said
uncle
richard
i
knows
them
of
old
last
week
some
of
them
offered
me
if
i
would
desert
my
party
but
i
was
going
to
forsake
my
people
i
have
been
in
purty
tight
places
this
year
one
night
when
i
come
home
my
little
girl
said
to
me
dere
ai
no
bread
in
de
house
now
that
jist
got
me
but
i
begun
to
pray
and
the
next
day
i
found
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
and
then
some
of
my
colored
friends
said
it
would
do
to
let
uncle
jack
starve
and
they
made
me
up
cents
my
wife
sometimes
gets
out
of
heart
but
she
do
see
very
far
off
i
wish
said
louis
after
jackson
had
left
that
some
of
our
northern
men
would
only
see
the
heroism
of
that
man
here
he
stands
facing
an
uncertain
future
no
longer
young
in
years
stripped
by
slavery
his
wife
not
in
full
sympathy
with
him
and
yet
with
what
courage
he
refused
the
bribe
yes
said
minnie
means
a
great
deal
for
a
man
landless
and
poor
with
no
assured
support
for
the
future
it
means
a
comfortable
fire
when
the
blasts
of
winter
are
roving
around
your
home
it
means
bread
for
the
little
ones
and
medicine
for
the
sick
child
and
little
start
in
life
but
on
the
other
hand
said
louis
it
meant
betrayal
of
the
interests
of
his
race
and
i
honor
the
faithfulness
which
shook
his
hands
from
receiving
the
bribe
and
clasping
hands
politically
with
his
oppressors
and
i
asked
myself
the
question
while
he
was
telling
his
story
which
hand
was
the
better
custodian
of
the
ballot
the
white
hand
that
offered
the
bribe
or
the
black
one
that
refused
it
i
think
the
time
will
come
when
some
of
the
anglo
saxon
race
will
blush
to
remember
that
when
they
were
trailing
the
banner
of
freedom
in
the
dust
black
men
were
grasping
it
with
earnest
hands
bearing
it
aloft
amid
persecution
pain
and
death
louis
said
minnie
very
seriously
i
think
the
nation
makes
one
great
mistake
in
settling
this
question
of
suffrage
it
seems
to
me
that
everything
gets
settled
on
a
partial
basis
when
they
are
reconstructing
the
government
why
not
lay
the
whole
foundation
anew
and
base
the
right
of
suffrage
not
on
the
claims
of
service
or
sex
but
on
the
broader
basis
of
our
common
humanity
because
minnie
we
are
not
prepared
for
it
this
hour
belongs
to
the
negro
but
louis
is
it
not
the
negro
woman
hour
also
has
she
not
as
many
rights
and
claims
as
the
negro
man
well
perhaps
she
has
but
darling
you
can
not
better
the
condition
of
the
colored
men
without
helping
the
colored
women
what
elevates
him
helps
her
all
that
may
be
true
but
i
can
not
recognize
that
the
negro
man
is
the
only
one
who
has
pressing
claims
at
this
hour
our
government
needs
woman
conscience
as
well
as
man
judgment
and
while
i
would
not
throw
a
straw
in
the
way
of
the
colored
man
even
though
i
know
that
he
would
vote
against
me
as
soon
as
he
gets
his
vote
yet
i
do
think
that
woman
should
have
some
power
to
defend
herself
from
oppression
and
equal
laws
as
if
she
were
a
man
but
really
i
should
not
like
to
see
you
wending
your
way
through
rough
and
brawling
mobs
to
the
polls
because
these
mobs
are
rough
and
coarse
i
would
have
women
vote
i
would
soften
the
asperity
of
the
mobs
and
bring
into
our
politics
a
deeper
and
broader
humanity
when
i
see
intemperance
send
its
floods
of
ruin
and
shame
to
the
homes
of
men
and
pass
by
the
that
are
constantly
grinding
out
their
fearful
grist
of
poverty
ruin
and
death
i
long
for
the
hour
when
woman
vote
will
be
levelled
against
these
charnel
houses
and
have
i
hope
the
power
to
close
them
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
why
darling
said
louis
gazing
admiringly
upon
the
earnest
enthusiasm
lighting
up
her
face
i
shall
begin
to
believe
that
you
are
a
woman
surely
you
would
not
have
me
a
woman
in
these
hours
of
trial
but
darling
i
did
not
think
that
you
were
such
an
advocate
for
women
voting
i
think
louis
that
basing
our
rights
on
the
ground
of
our
common
humanity
is
the
only
true
foundation
for
national
peace
and
durability
if
you
would
have
the
government
strong
and
enduring
you
should
entrench
it
in
the
hearts
of
both
the
men
and
women
of
the
land
i
think
you
are
right
in
that
remark
said
louis
and
thus
their
evenings
were
enlivened
by
pleasant
and
interesting
conversations
upon
the
topics
of
the
day
once
when
a
union
friend
was
spending
an
evening
at
their
home
louis
entered
looking
somewhat
animated
and
minnie
ever
ready
to
detect
his
moods
and
feelings
wanted
to
know
what
had
happened
oh
i
have
been
to
a
wedding
since
i
left
home
and
pray
who
was
married
guess
i
do
know
whom
to
guess
one
of
our
friends
yes
was
it
mr
welland
yes
and
who
did
he
marry
is
she
a
northern
woman
and
a
staunch
unionist
well
i
ca
imagine
who
she
can
be
why
he
married
miss
henson
who
sent
you
those
beautiful
flowers
why
louis
is
it
possible
why
she
is
a
colored
woman
i
know
but
how
came
he
to
marry
her
for
the
same
reason
i
married
you
because
he
loved
her
well
said
the
union
man
who
sat
quietly
listening
i
am
willing
to
give
to
the
colored
people
every
right
that
i
possess
myself
but
as
to
intermarrying
with
them
i
am
not
prepared
for
that
i
think
said
louis
that
marrying
and
social
equality
among
the
races
will
simply
regulate
itself
i
do
not
think
under
the
present
condition
of
things
that
there
will
be
any
general
intermarrying
of
the
races
but
this
idea
of
rooted
antagonism
of
races
to
me
is
all
moonshine
i
believe
that
what
you
call
the
instincts
of
race
are
only
the
prejudices
which
are
the
result
of
custom
and
education
and
if
there
is
any
instinct
in
the
matter
it
is
rather
the
instinct
of
nature
to
make
a
race
in
a
climate
welland
told
me
that
he
had
met
his
wife
when
she
was
a
slave
that
he
loved
her
then
and
would
have
bought
her
had
it
been
in
his
power
but
now
that
freedom
had
come
to
her
he
was
glad
to
have
the
privilege
of
making
her
his
wife
he
is
an
englishman
by
birth
and
he
intends
taking
her
home
with
him
to
england
when
a
favorable
opportunity
presents
itself
and
that
is
far
more
honorable
and
manly
than
living
together
after
the
old
order
of
things
i
think
said
louis
facing
the
floor
that
a
cruel
wrong
was
done
to
minnie
and
myself
when
life
was
given
to
us
under
conditions
that
doomed
us
to
hopeless
slavery
and
from
which
we
were
rescued
only
by
good
fortune
i
have
heard
some
colored
persons
boasting
of
the
white
blood
but
i
always
feel
like
blushing
for
mine
much
as
my
father
did
for
me
he
could
never
atone
for
giving
me
life
under
the
conditions
he
did
never
mind
said
minnie
it
all
turned
out
for
the
best
yes
darling
said
louis
growing
calmer
for
it
gave
me
you
and
that
was
life
compensation
but
the
question
of
the
intermingling
of
the
races
in
marriage
is
one
that
scarcely
interests
this
question
the
question
that
presses
upon
us
with
the
most
fearful
distinctness
is
how
can
we
make
life
secure
in
the
south
i
sometimes
feel
as
if
the
very
air
was
busting
with
bayonets
there
is
no
law
here
but
the
revolver
there
must
be
a
screw
loose
somewhere
and
this
government
that
taxes
its
men
in
peace
and
drafts
them
in
war
ought
to
be
wise
enough
to
know
its
citizens
and
strong
enough
to
protect
them
chapter
xix
but
the
pleasant
of
louis
and
minnie
was
destined
to
be
rudely
broken
up
he
began
to
receive
threats
and
anonymous
letters
such
as
these
louis
lecroix
you
are
a
doomed
man
we
are
determined
to
tolerate
no
scalawags
nor
carpetbaggers
among
us
beware
the
sacred
serpent
has
hissed
but
louis
brave
and
resolute
kept
on
the
even
tenor
of
his
way
although
he
never
left
his
home
without
some
forebodings
that
he
tried
in
vain
to
cast
off
but
his
young
wife
being
less
in
contact
with
the
brutal
elements
of
society
in
that
region
did
not
comprehend
the
danger
as
louis
did
and
yet
she
could
not
help
feeling
anxious
for
her
husband
safety
they
never
parted
without
her
looking
after
him
with
a
sigh
and
then
turning
to
her
school
or
whatever
work
or
reading
she
had
on
her
hand
she
would
strive
to
suppress
her
heart
forebodings
but
the
storm
about
to
burst
and
to
darken
forever
the
sunshine
of
that
home
was
destined
to
fall
on
that
fair
young
head
imperative
business
called
louis
from
home
for
one
night
minnie
stood
at
the
door
and
said
louis
i
hate
to
have
you
go
i
have
been
feeling
so
badly
here
lately
as
if
something
was
going
to
happen
come
home
as
soon
as
you
can
i
will
darling
he
said
kissing
her
tenderly
again
and
again
i
do
feel
rather
loath
to
leave
you
but
death
is
every
where
always
lurking
in
ambush
a
man
may
escape
from
an
earthquake
to
be
strangled
by
a
hair
so
darling
keep
in
good
spirits
till
i
come
minnie
stood
at
the
door
watching
him
till
he
was
out
of
sight
and
then
turning
to
her
mother
with
a
sigh
she
said
what
a
wretched
state
of
society
when
he
goes
i
never
feel
easy
till
he
returns
i
do
wish
we
had
a
government
under
which
our
lives
would
be
just
as
safe
as
they
were
in
pennsylvania
ellen
felt
very
anxious
but
she
tried
to
hide
her
disquietude
and
keep
minnie
spirits
from
sinking
and
so
she
said
this
is
a
hard
country
we
colored
people
have
seen
our
hard
times
here
but
mother
do
you
sometimes
feel
bitter
towards
these
people
who
have
treated
you
so
unkindly
no
minnie
i
used
to
but
i
do
now
god
says
we
must
forgive
and
if
we
do
forgive
he
wo
forgive
but
mother
how
did
you
get
to
feeling
so
why
honey
i
used
to
suffer
until
my
heart
was
almost
ready
to
burst
but
i
learned
to
cast
my
burden
on
the
lord
and
then
my
misery
all
passed
away
my
burden
fell
off
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
and
i
felt
that
my
feet
were
planted
on
a
rock
how
wonderful
said
minnie
is
this
faith
how
real
it
is
to
them
how
near
some
of
these
suffering
people
have
drawn
to
god
yes
said
ellen
sumpter
had
a
colored
woman
to
whom
they
were
real
mean
and
cruel
and
one
day
they
whipped
her
and
beat
her
on
her
feet
to
keep
her
from
running
away
but
she
made
up
her
mind
to
leave
and
so
she
packed
up
her
clothes
to
run
away
but
before
she
started
i
believe
she
kneeled
down
and
prayed
and
asked
what
she
should
do
and
something
reasoned
with
her
and
said
still
and
see
what
i
am
going
to
do
for
you
and
so
she
unpacked
her
clothes
and
stayed
and
now
the
best
part
of
it
was
this
milly
son
had
been
away
and
he
came
back
and
brought
with
him
money
enough
to
buy
his
mother
for
he
had
been
out
begging
money
to
buy
her
and
so
milly
got
free
and
she
was
mighty
glad
that
she
had
stayed
because
when
he
come
back
if
she
had
been
gone
he
would
not
have
known
where
to
find
her
well
it
is
wonderful
somehow
these
people
have
passed
through
the
darkness
and
laid
their
hands
on
god
robe
of
love
and
light
and
have
been
sustained
it
seems
to
me
that
some
things
they
see
clearer
through
their
tears
mother
said
minnie
as
it
is
saturday
i
will
visit
some
of
my
scholars
well
minnie
i
would
you
look
troubled
and
may
be
you
feel
better
yes
mother
i
often
feel
strengthened
after
visiting
some
of
these
good
old
souls
and
getting
glimpses
into
their
inner
life
i
sometimes
ask
them
after
listening
to
the
story
of
their
past
wrongs
what
has
sustained
you
what
has
kept
you
up
and
the
almost
invariable
answer
has
been
the
power
of
god
some
of
these
poor
old
souls
who
have
been
turned
adrift
to
shift
for
themselves
do
live
by
bread
alone
they
live
by
bread
and
faith
in
god
i
asked
one
of
them
a
few
days
since
are
you
not
afraid
of
starving
and
the
answer
was
not
while
god
lives
after
minnie
left
she
visited
a
number
of
lowly
cabins
the
first
one
she
entered
was
the
home
of
an
industrious
couple
who
were
just
making
a
start
in
life
the
room
in
which
minnie
was
had
no
only
an
aperture
that
supplied
them
with
light
but
also
admitted
the
cold
why
do
you
have
said
minnie
oh
we
must
crawl
before
we
walk
and
yet
even
in
this
humble
home
they
had
taken
two
orphan
children
of
their
race
and
were
giving
them
food
and
shelter
and
this
kindness
to
the
orphans
of
their
race
minnie
found
to
be
a
very
praiseworthy
practice
among
some
of
those
people
who
were
not
poorer
than
themselves
the
next
cabin
she
entered
was
very
neat
though
it
bore
evidences
of
poverty
the
woman
in
referring
to
the
past
told
her
how
her
child
had
been
taken
away
when
it
was
about
two
years
old
and
how
she
had
lost
all
trace
of
him
and
would
not
know
him
if
he
stood
in
her
presence
how
did
you
feel
said
minnie
i
felt
as
i
was
going
to
my
grave
but
i
thought
if
i
would
get
justice
here
i
would
get
it
in
another
world
my
husband
said
another
asked
if
god
is
a
just
god
how
would
sich
as
slavery
be
and
something
answered
and
said
sha
always
be
and
you
could
beat
it
out
of
my
husband
head
that
the
spirit
speak
to
him
and
thus
the
morning
waned
away
and
minnie
returned
calmer
than
when
she
had
left
a
holy
peace
stole
over
her
mind
she
felt
that
for
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
there
was
a
common
refuge
that
there
was
no
corner
so
dark
that
the
light
of
heaven
could
not
shine
through
and
that
these
people
in
their
ignorance
and
simplicity
had
learned
to
look
upon
god
as
a
friend
coming
near
to
them
in
their
sorrows
and
taking
cognizance
of
their
wants
and
woes
minnie
loved
to
listen
to
these
beautiful
stories
of
faith
and
trust
to
her
they
were
grand
inspirations
to
faith
and
duty
sometimes
minnie
would
think
when
listening
to
some
dear
aged
saint
i
ca
teach
these
people
religion
i
must
learn
from
them
refreshed
and
strengthened
she
returned
home
and
began
to
work
upon
a
dress
for
a
destitute
and
orphaned
child
and
when
night
came
she
retired
quite
early
being
somewhat
wearied
with
her
day
work
during
his
absence
louis
had
been
among
the
freedmen
in
a
new
settlement
where
he
had
lately
established
a
school
where
notwithstanding
all
their
disadvantages
he
was
pleased
to
see
evidences
of
growth
and
progress
there
was
an
earnestness
and
growing
manliness
that
commanded
his
respect
they
were
beginning
to
learn
the
power
of
combination
and
gave
but
little
heed
to
the
cajoling
words
we
are
your
best
friends
do
you
think
louis
said
to
an
intelligent
freedman
that
the
rebels
are
your
best
friends
i
think
so
when
i
lose
my
senses
but
you
are
ignorant
louis
said
to
another
one
how
will
you
know
whom
to
vote
for
well
if
i
do
i
know
how
not
to
vote
for
a
rebel
how
do
you
know
you
did
vote
for
a
rebel
said
louis
to
another
one
who
came
from
one
of
the
most
benighted
districts
i
voted
for
one
of
my
own
color
as
if
treason
and
a
black
skin
were
incompatible
in
the
evening
louis
called
the
people
together
and
talked
with
them
trying
to
keep
them
from
being
discouraged
for
the
times
were
evil
and
the
days
were
very
gloomy
the
impeachment
had
failed
state
after
state
in
the
north
had
voted
against
enfranchising
the
colored
man
in
their
midst
the
spirit
of
the
lost
cause
revived
murders
multiplied
the
ku
klux
spread
terror
and
death
around
every
item
of
northern
meanness
to
the
colored
people
in
their
midst
was
a
message
of
hope
to
the
rebel
element
of
the
south
which
had
only
changed
ballot
and
bullet
had
failed
but
another
resort
was
found
in
secret
assassination
men
advocating
equal
rights
did
so
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
for
violence
and
murder
were
rampant
in
the
land
oh
those
dark
and
weary
days
when
politicians
were
flattering
for
place
and
murdered
union
men
were
sleeping
in
their
bloody
shrouds
louis
courage
did
not
desert
him
and
he
tried
to
nerve
the
hearts
of
those
that
were
sinking
with
fear
in
those
days
of
gloom
and
terror
his
advice
to
the
people
was
defend
your
firesides
if
they
are
invaded
live
as
peaceably
as
you
can
spare
no
pains
to
educate
your
children
be
saving
and
industrious
try
to
get
land
under
your
feet
and
homes
over
your
heads
my
faith
is
very
strong
in
political
parties
but
as
the
world
has
outgrown
other
forms
of
wrong
i
believe
that
it
will
outgrow
this
also
we
must
trust
and
hope
for
better
things
what
else
could
he
say
and
yet
there
were
times
when
his
words
seemed
to
him
almost
like
bitter
mockery
here
was
outrage
upon
outrage
committed
upon
these
people
and
to
tell
them
to
hope
and
wait
for
better
times
but
seemed
like
speaking
hollow
words
oh
he
longed
for
a
central
administration
strong
enough
to
put
down
violence
and
misrule
in
the
south
if
johnson
was
clasping
hands
with
rebels
and
traitors
was
there
no
power
in
congress
to
give
at
least
security
to
life
must
they
wait
till
murder
was
organized
into
an
institution
and
life
and
property
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
mob
and
if
so
would
not
such
a
government
be
a
farce
and
such
a
civilization
a
failure
with
these
reflections
passing
through
his
mind
he
fell
asleep
but
his
slumber
was
restless
and
disturbed
he
dreamed
but
it
seemed
so
plain
to
him
that
he
thought
it
was
hardly
a
dream
that
minnie
came
to
his
side
and
pressed
her
lips
to
his
but
they
were
very
pale
and
very
cold
he
reached
out
his
hand
to
clasp
her
but
she
was
gone
but
as
she
vanished
he
heard
her
say
my
husband
restless
and
uneasy
he
arose
there
was
a
strange
feeling
around
his
soul
a
great
sinking
and
depression
of
his
spirits
he
could
not
account
for
his
feelings
he
arose
and
walked
the
floor
and
looked
up
at
the
heavens
but
the
night
was
very
bright
and
beautiful
still
he
could
not
shake
off
his
strange
and
sad
forebodings
and
as
soon
as
it
was
light
he
started
for
home
installment
missing
chapter
xx
in
the
afternoon
when
the
body
had
been
prepared
for
the
grave
the
sorrowing
friends
gathered
around
tearfully
noting
the
look
of
peace
and
rest
which
had
stolen
over
the
pale
dead
face
when
all
traces
of
the
death
agony
had
passed
away
by
the
contraction
of
the
muscles
that
is
just
the
way
she
looked
yesterday
said
a
woman
whose
face
showed
traces
of
a
deep
and
fearful
sorrow
louis
drew
near
for
he
was
eager
to
hear
any
word
that
told
him
of
minnie
before
death
had
robbed
her
of
life
and
him
of
peace
he
came
near
enough
to
hear
but
not
to
interrupt
the
conversation
she
was
at
my
house
yesterday
trying
to
comfort
me
when
i
was
telling
her

but
i

of

and
she
was
at

crib
and
so
i
would
it

hard

along
but
i
hopes
for

times
and
den
she
took
down
de
bible
and
read
wid
dat
sweet
voice
of
hers
about
de
eagle
stirring
up
her
nest
and
den
she
said
when
de
old
eagle
wanted
her
young
to
fly
she
broked
up
de
nest
and
de
little
eagles
did
known
what

de
matter
but
some
how
dey
did
feel
so
cumfertable
de
little
twigs
and
sticks
stuck
in
and
den
dey
would
work
dere
wings
and
dat
was
de
way
she
said
we
must
do
de
ole
nest

broke
up
but
she
said
we
get
discouraged
but
we
must
plume
our
wings
for

flying
oh
she
did
tell

so
purty
i
wish

was
side
of
her
but
bound
to
meet
her
i
gwine
to
set
out
afresh
for
heben
and
glory
and
thus
did
these
stricken
children
of
sorrow
unconsciously
comfort
the
desolate
and
almost
breaking
heart
of
louis
lacroix
and
their
words
of
love
and
hope
were
like
rays
of
light
shimmering
amid
the
gloomy
shadows
that
overhung
his
suddenly
darkened
life
surely
thought
louis
if
the
blessings
and
tears
of
the
poor
and
needy
and
the
prayers
of
him
who
was
ready
to
perish
would
crystalize
a
path
to
the
then
minnie
exit
from
earth
must
have
been
over
a
bridge
of
light
above
whose
radiant
arches
hovering
angels
would
delight
to
bend
while
these
thoughts
were
passing
through
his
mind
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
and
louis
rose
to
open
it
and
then
he
saw
a
sight
which
shook
all
his
gathered
firmness
to
tears
headed
by
the
eldest
of
scholars
came
a
procession
of
children
each
one
bearing
a
bunch
of
fairest
and
brightest
flowers
to
spread
around
the
couch
of
their
beloved
teacher
some
kissed
her
and
others
threw
themselves
beside
the
corpse
and
wept
bitter
burning
tears
all
shared
in
louis
grief
for
all
had
lost
a
dear
good
friend
and
loving
instructor
louis
summoned
all
the
energies
of
his
soul
to
bear
his
mournful
loss
it
was
his
task
to
bow
to
the
chastener
and
let
his
loved
one
go
feeling
that
when
he
had
laid
her
in
the
earth
that
he
left
her
there
in
the
hope
of
a
better
resurrection
life
with
its
solemn
responsibilities
still
met
him
its
earnest
duties
still
confronted
him
and
though
he
sometimes
felt
like
a
weary
watcher
at
the
gates
of
death
longing
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
shining
robes
and
the
radiant
light
of
her
glorified
face
yet
her
knew
it
was
his
work
to
labor
and
to
wait
sorrow
and
danger
still
surrounded
his
way
and
he
felt
his
soul
more
strongly
drawn
out
than
ever
to
share
the
fortunes
of
the
colored
race
he
felt
there
were
grand
possibilities
stored
up
in
their
future
the
name
of
the
negro
had
been
associated
with
slavery
ignorance
and
poverty
and
he
determined
as
far
as
his
influence
could
be
exerted
to
lift
that
name
from
the
dust
of
the
centuries
and
place
it
among
the
most
honored
names
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
he
still
remained
in
the
south
for
minnie
grave
had
made
the
south
to
him
a
sacred
place
a
place
in
which
to
labor
and
to
wait
until
peace
like
bright
dew
should
descend
where
carnage
had
spread
ruin
around
and
freedom
and
justice
like
glorified
angels
should
reign
triumphant
where
violence
and
slavery
had
held
their
fearful
carnival
of
shame
and
crime
for
ages
earnestly
he
set
himself
to
bring
around
the
hour
when
peace
and
pure
should
move
rifts
of
ruin
deep
and
wide
when
her
hands
should
span
with
lasting
love
the
chasms
rent
by
hate
and
pride
and
he
was
blessed
in
his
labors
of
love
and
faith
conclusion
and
now
in
conclusion
may
i
not
ask
the
indulgence
of
my
readers
for
a
few
moments
simply
to
say
that
louis
and
minnie
are
only
ideal
beings
touched
here
and
there
with
a
coloring
from
real
life
but
while
i
confess
not
wishing
to
the
most
lawless
of
the
that
minnie
has
only
lived
and
died
in
my
imagination
may
i
not
modestly
ask
that
the
lesson
of
minnie
shall
have
its
place
among
the
educational
ideas
for
the
advancement
of
our
race
the
greatest
want
of
our
people
if
i
understand
our
wants
aright
is
not
simply
wealth
nor
genius
nor
mere
intelligence
but
live
men
and
earnest
lovely
women
whose
lives
shall
represent
not
a
stagnant
mass
but
a
living
force
we
have
wealth
among
us
but
how
much
of
it
is
ever
spent
in
building
up
the
future
of
the
race
in
encouraging
talent
and
developing
genius
we
have
intelligence
but
how
much
do
we
add
to
the
reservoir
of
the
world
thought
we
have
genius
among
us
but
how
much
can
it
rely
upon
the
colored
race
for
support
take
even
the
where
are
the
graduates
from
colleges
and
high
school
whose
pens
and
brains
lend
beauty
strength
grace
and
culture
to
its
pages
if
when
their
school
days
are
over
the
last
composition
shall
have
been
given
at
the
examination
will
not
the
disused
faculties
revenge
themselves
by
rusting
if
i
could
say
it
without
being
officious
and
intrusive
i
would
say
to
some
who
are
about
to
graduate
this
year
do
not
feel
that
your
education
is
finished
when
the
diploma
of
your
institution
is
in
your
hands
look
upon
the
knowledge
you
have
gained
only
as
a
stepping
stone
to
a
future
which
you
are
determined
shall
grandly
contrast
with
the
past
while
some
of
the
authors
of
the
present
day
have
been
weaving
their
stories
about
white
men
marrying
beautiful
quadroon
girls
who
in
so
doing
were
lost
to
us
socially
i
conceived
of
one
of
that
same
class
to
whom
i
gave
a
higher
holier
destiny
a
life
of
lofty
and
beautiful
finished
at
the
post
of
duty
and
rounded
off
with
the
fiery
crown
of
martyrdom
a
circlet
which
ever
changes
into
a
diadem
of
glory
the
lesson
of
minnie
sacrifice
is
this
that
it
is
braver
to
suffer
with
one
own
branch
of
the
human
race
to
feel
that
the
weaker
and
the
more
despised
they
are
the
closer
we
will
cling
to
them
for
the
sake
of
helping
them
than
to
attempt
to
creep
out
of
all
identity
with
them
in
their
feebleness
for
the
sake
of
mere
personal
advantages
and
to
do
this
at
the
expense
of
and
a
true
manhood
and
a
truly
dignified
womanhood
that
with
whatever
gifts
we
possess
whether
they
be
genius
culture
wealth
or
social
position
we
can
best
serve
the
interests
of
our
race
by
a
generous
and
loving
diffusion
than
by
a
narrow
and
selfish
isolation
which
after
all
is
only
one
type
of
the
barbarous
and
state
notes
the

two
paragraphs
are
for
the
most
part
illegible
i
have
reproduced
below
as
much
of
the
text
as
can
be
deciphered
the
whole
south
is
in
a
state
of
excitement
nurture
and
high
be
for
they
are
and
only
remember
they
are
rebels
they
urge
the
agenda
and
their
brothers
in
their
mistaken
folly
like
the
women
of
carthage
ancient
and
magnificent
city
was
they
were
ready
to
sacrifice
their
and
if
need
be
would
have
cut
but
it
have
been
so
dear
to
their
hearts
