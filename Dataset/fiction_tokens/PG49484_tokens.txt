the
dear
memory
of

first
inspired
my

i
dedicate
these
pages
my
friend
pasquale
chapter
i
the
events
narrated
in
the
following
story
happened
a
score
and
more
of
years
ago
they
have
never
before
been
made
public
and
i
make
them
known
now
with
pain
and
misgiving
but
impelled
by
a
sense
of
duty
which
i
can
no
longer
disregard
during
their
occurrence
they
changed
the
current
of
my
life
once
from
grave
to
gay
and
then
and
finally
from
gaiety
to
unspeakable
gloom
although
time
has
to
some
extent
dulled
the
edge
of
my
grief
at
the
loss
of
my
friend
pasquale
his
memory
will
remain
with
me
while
life
lasts
as
a
cherished
and
sacred
thing
when
the
reader
ends
this
simple
narration
this
eulogy
of
the
dead
may
surprise
and
shock
him
and
in
reply
and
explanation
i
have
only
to
say
in
advance
that
i
pity
him
if
the
faithful
unvarnished
record
leaves
that
impression
on
his
mind
he
did
not
know
pasquale
i
was
wending
my
way
homeward
from
hampstead
heath
one
saturday
afternoon
in
the
early
summer
time
when
i
found
myself
on
recovering
from
a
lengthened
reverie
midway
on
the
old
north
road
at
a
point
now
occupied
by
the
midland
railway
terminus
at
saint
pancras
my
work
at
the
bank
was
finished
and
with
it
all
the
duties
of
the
week
and
i
felt
that
sense
of
relief
and
buoyancy
which
perhaps
comes
to
all
young
and
old
alike
at
the
completion
of
tedious
work
honestly
performed
i
was
still
at
the
period
of
which
i
write
a
good
deal
of
a
living
in
a
world
of
my
own
for
many
hours
of
the
and
when
the
heavy
bank
doors
clanged
behind
me
with
all
business
cares
and
anxieties
doubly
barred
within
the
impregnable
vault
my
mind
would
soar
away
from
business
thoughts
as
an
imprisoned
lark
leaps
to
freedom
from
its
narrow
cage
the
road
i
was
traveling
was
not
one
which
i
would
have
taken
intentionally
but
in
my
fit
of
i
had
unconsciously
followed
the
trend
of
the
highway
with
the
result
that
i
was
committed
to
one
of
the
most
uninviting
thoroughfares
in
the
city
of
london
as
a
highway
this
road
was
but
little
used
it
had
already
been
secured
by
the
railway
company
and
with
the
exception
of
one
of
low
character
there
were
no
dwellings
fronting
it
but
only
the
wreck
of
the
torn
down
structures
demolished
to
make
way
for
the
projected
improvements
and
this
wreckage
was
walled
or
penned
in
by
a
high
and
closely
boarded
fence
running
the
full
length
of
the
road
the
old
north
road
was
nearly
a
mile
in
length
between
these
wooden
walls
and
it
was
a
street
to
be
shunned
not
only
by
females
but
by
solitary
travelers
of
even
the
stronger
sex
for
it
afforded
no
means
of
escape
from
an
unpleasant
encounter
when
i
had
traveled
about
one
third
of
its
length
my
attention
was
attracted
to
an
excited
group
of
men
some
three
hundred
yards
distant
these
men
i
found
on
nearing
them
to
be
employed
by
the
railway
company
and
already
a
good
deal
exhilarated
by
their
libations
they
were
powerful
men
a
collection
of
sooty
giants
and
the
sport
which
they
were
enjoying
was
an
impromptu
an
amusement
entirely
after
their
own
heart
as
i
approached
the
group
on
the
one
side
a
young
man
of
about
my
own
age
neared
it
from
the
other
and
we
both
stopped
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
the
excitement
the
sight
of
one
dog
apparently
killing
the
other
was
to
me
a
revolting
spectacle
and
i
was
turning
away
in
disgust
when
i
saw
the
other
arrival
elbow
his
way
fiercely
through
the
men
and
attempt
to
drag
off
the
dog
which
seemed
to
be
gaining
the
victory
in
doing
which
he
certainly
risked
his
life
you
great
black
cowards
he
shouted
his
voice
ringing
in
the
air
like
a
trumpet
allow
two
poor
creatures
to
worry
each
other
in
such
a
way
his
movements
were
so
sudden
that
he
had
actually
grasped
one
of
the
dogs
before
his
intention
could
be
frustrated
but
as
soon
as
he
touched
the
animal
a
burly
seized
him
round
the
waist
and
lifting
him
high
in
air
carried
him
out
of
the
crush
into
the
middle
of
the
road
where
he
planted
him
on
the
ground
and
released
his
hold
not
altogether
but
yet
with
a
warning
look
in
his
grimy
face
he
placed
his
bulky
body
in
front
of
the
disturber
of
the
fight
saying
as
he
did
so
we
are
not
molesting
you
leave
us
alone
or
the
threat
in
his
eyes
supplied
the
rest
the
stranger
whose
face
was
pale
as
death
and
whose
eyes
literally
flamed
with
rage
said
not
a
word
but
quick
as
lightning
his
right
hand
shot
out
and
struck
his
opponent
straight
between
the
eyes
the
amazing
fury
of
the
blow
the
skill
with
which
it
was
given
and
the
smallness
of
the
hand
which
struck
it
had
to
some
extent
the
same
effect
on
the
dense
skull
of
the
as
the
pole
axe
has
on
the
head
of
the
ox
he
fell
not
backward
but
forward
on
his
knees
as
a
bullock
falls
when
struck
the
group
around
the
two
dogs
had
given
no
more
thought
to
the
intruder
after
their
companion
had
removed
him
but
now
one
looked
around
and
seeing
his
friend
on
the
ground
and
probably
concluding
that
the
stranger
had
stabbed
him
he
rushed
to
secure
the
intruder
the
latter
however
seemed
possessed
with
an
ungovernable
fury
and
flew
at
his
new
assailant
as
if
he
would
rend
him
to
pieces
even
a
blow
from
the
ponderous
fist
though
it
landed
him
three
yards
away
flat
on
his
back
in
the
dusty
road
in
nowise
discouraged
him
in
a
moment
he
was
on
his
feet
flying
like
a
at
his
throat
his
dark
eyes
gleaming
anew
with
electric
fire
in
the
midst
of
the
a
hansom
cab
drove
up
and
the
driver
stopped
to
witness
the
double
event
others
of
the
group
now
gathered
around
and
i
feared
not
for
the
safety
of
the
limbs
but
for
his
life
it
was
an
group
for
any
single
man
to
attack
these
men
although
easygoing
enough
up
to
a
certain
point
were
incarnate
fiends
when
roused
and
they
were
already
disposed
to
be
quarrelsome
at
length
the
tore
the
other
from
his
throat
and
getting
him
at
length
promptly
felled
him
to
the
ground
no
movement
this
time
was
he
dead
that
blow
might
well
have
fractured
the
skull
of
a
delicate
man
such
men
always
stop
at
blows
and
when
one
the
worse
for
liquor
shouted
the
fellow
i
called
to
the
cabman
sake
get
the
injured
man
out
of
get
him
inside
here
promptly
replied
the
driver
back
i
yelled
to
the
men
with
a
horrified
air
which
was
only
have
killed
him
and
stooping
down
i
raised
the
slender
figure
in
my
arms
as
i
did
so
the
cabman
turned
his
horse
as
if
to
drive
off
but
in
reality
in
order
to
put
his
vehicle
between
the
men
and
myself
this
he
did
with
much
adroitness
and
without
obstruction
as
the
others
thought
he
was
simply
preparing
to
leave
his
movement
enabled
me
to
place
the
slowly
recovering
figure
in
the
hansom
cab
without
interference
on
i
shouted
but
alas
a
hercules
had
seen
my
movements
and
had
grasped
the
head
with
a
grip
of
iron
it
was
the
brute
who
had
yelled
knowing
remonstrance
to
be
entirely
useless
i
struck
the
wretch
with
my
stick
with
all
the
force
i
could
muster
he
staggered
under
the
blow
and
released
his
hold
a
moment
more
and
the
horse
sprang
forward
and
as
the
cab
passed
me
i
caught
at
the
seat
and
with
one
hand
on
that
and
a
foot
on
the
powerful
spring
which
supported
the
body
of
the
carriage
on
that
side
i
managed
to
hold
on
until
we
were
clear
of
the
dangers
which
threatened
us
when
i
joined
my
inside
the
cab
i
found
him
crouching
on
his
knees
with
his
head
buried
in
the
cushion
of
the
seat
he
had
recovered
consciousness
and
was
moaning
softly
you
hurt
i
inquired
as
i
entered
the
cab
alarmed
lest
the
merciless
blow
of
the
laborer
should
have
done
the
stranger
some
serious
injury
the
face
which
was
upturned
to
my
gaze
was
ghastly
pale
and
a
wide
of
sombre
shadow
under
the
dark
eyes
lent
to
the
latter
a
strange
unnatural
brilliancy
i
am
not
hurt
he
replied
it
always
upsets
me
very
much
to
witness
cruelty
of
any
kind
did
you
see
the
dogs
as
he
made
the
inquiry
a
shudder
ran
through
his
frame
as
if
the
recollection
of
the
sickening
spectacle
had
revolted
him
anew
the
rest
of
the
journey
to
my
quarters
was
performed
in
silence
while
i
mindful
of
the
mad
fury
of
my
attack
on
the
labored
mentally
to
discover
where
the
consistency
lay
in
trying
to
seriously
injure
a
human
being
because
he
objected
to
the
stoppage
of
a
i
had
indeed
no
love
for
the
brutal
but
i
was
nevertheless
sensible
of
a
spirit
of
incongruity
about
my
actions
and
i
was
still
puzzling
over
the
problem
when
the
cab
reached
its
destination
my
own
rooms
after
i
had
assisted
my
to
alight
and
had
discharged
my
obligations
to
the
cabman
the
latter
addressing
my
new
friend
told
him
that
he
had
undoubtedly
had
a
narrow
escape
those
men
got
hold
of
you
at
the
last
a
squad
of
police
could
not
have
saved
you
you
have
to
thank
that
gentleman
that
you
are
not
now
lying
battered
out
of
shape
on
the
old
north
road
and
i
know
both
the
men
and
the
when
the
stranger
heard
this
he
turned
towards
me
with
eyes
suffused
with
tears
and
raised
my
hand
to
his
lips
thank
you
for
saving
my
life
he
murmured
i
will
never
forget
the
debt
i
owe
i
replied
somewhat
ashamed
at
the
novel
attention
i
was
receiving
that
but
for
the
cabman
the
incident
on
the
road
would
probably
have
proved
fatal
to
both
of
us
when
the
cabman
left
he
carried
with
him
a
which
made
the
compensation
paid
by
myself
mean
and
contemptible
in
comparison
sir
and
god
if
ever
either
of
ye
want
a
friend
i
hope
will
owen
may
be
on
hand
to
take
the
office
saying
which
he
wheeled
his
cab
as
on
a
pivot
saluted
with
the
handle
of
his
whip
touched
his
horse
with
the
lash
and
drove
off
when
i
turned
to
my
companion
i
found
him
staring
confusedly
at
the
houses
where
are
we
he
inquired
with
considerable
astonishment
in
his
voice
russell
square
and
this
is
where
i
live
pointing
to
no
where
the
hansom
had
stopped
that
is
certainly
very
remarkable
he
observed
with
a
low
laugh
of
astonishment
i
live
next
door
to
saying
this
he
handed
me
his
card
on
which
i
found
engraved
amidio
pasquale
russell
square
london
chose
no
for
a
residence
to
see
whether
there
were
any
in
the
this
last
remark
was
the
result
of
my
having
somewhat
unconsciously
repeated
the
word
but
i
was
thinking
only
of
the
extraordinary
coincidence
that
we
who
had
been
brought
together
under
such
circumstances
that
day
as
would
almost
certainly
tend
to
bind
us
to
each
other
in
future
should
find
ourselves
already
neighbors
was
it
a
coincidence
or
was
it
only
the
first
distinct
move
made
by
the
finger
of
fate
on
the
of
our
lives
now
in
these
later
years
when
i
recall
the
terrible
ending
to
our
brief
friendship
begun
that
afternoon
it
seems
to
my
embittered
and
discouraged
soul
that
there
was
naught
of
coincidence
in
the
circumstance
at
all
but
that
the
time
having
come
destiny
began
her
grim
and
task
in
that
kindly
work
of
mercy
attempted
on
the
old
north
road
that
day
reckless
whether
the
blows
which
fell
so
unrelentingly
from
her
hand
were
struck
by
means
of
the
crosier
of
the
churchman
or
by
the
bludgeon
of
the
assassin
or
whether
it
was
the
pinion
of
an
angel
or
the
hoof
of
a
demon
which
she
had
seized
to
speed
her
in
her
dire
inscrutable
work
is
it
because
best
deeds
fall
so
far
short
of
the
approval
of
the
immortal
gods
that
ofttimes
they
appear
to
be
used
in
sheer
satire
as
instruments
of
untold
misery
and
tragedy
my
friend
accompanied
me
to
my
rooms
and
for
a
time
he
sat
in
silence
crouching
over
the
fire
in
the
grate
and
every
now
and
then
shivering
as
if
from
the
sight
of
another
horror
the
appearance
of
the
dogs
impress
you
so
very
painfully
i
inquired
anxious
to
find
some
solution
for
my
new
state
of
speak
of
it
he
exclaimed
his
voice
quivering
with
emotion
and
the
tears
welling
in
his
eyes
dog
was
literally
being
worried
to
death
yes
i
replied
looks
like
that
but
there
are
many
ups
and
downs
even
in
a
dog
fight
probably
the
under
dog
had
its
turn
after
a
while
and
it
is
surprising
how
much
chewing
they
can
stand
from
each
other
and
be
but
little
the
pasquale
turned
upon
me
speechless
for
the
moment
with
horror
then
ere
his
glance
had
lengthened
to
a
stony
glare
he
said
with
an
apparent
effort
at
restraint
i
forgot
you
did
not
see
the
animals
and
can
not
therefore
know
how
terrible
it
all
be
content
i
hastened
to
say
by
way
of
encouragement
did
your
best
you
knocked
one
almost
senseless
and
you
tore
the
to
pieces
besides
lacerating
his
face
and
you
know
he
interrupted
striding
up
to
me
with
his
eyes
aflame
and
the
veins
standing
out
round
and
black
on
his
forehead
you
know
sir
that
i
would
have
liked
to
tear
those
men
limb
from
limb
for
stopping
me
and
i
almost
think
i
would
have
done
so
if
i
had
not
been
and
i
thought
so
too
as
i
gazed
at
him
standing
there
almost
suffocated
with
the
fury
of
passion
this
strange
anomaly
this
combination
of
tenderness
and
tigerish
ferocity
was
a
complete
mystery
to
me
and
i
felt
bewildered
at
the
contemplation
of
it
after
a
time
my
mood
changed
and
he
apologized
humbly
for
his
outbreak
am
entirely
unhinged
by
the
events
of
the
day
he
said
gently
am
not
usually
like
this
i
can
assure
a
statement
fully
borne
out
by
my
of
him
for
a
brighter
gentler
more
delightful
companion
i
shall
never
again
meet
in
this
world
his
last
words
as
he
left
me
were
am
not
feeling
well
and
shall
go
away
for
a
week
but
when
i
return
you
and
i
must
see
much
of
each
chapter
ii
life
in
london
had
great
attractions
for
me
during
the
first
year
of
my
residence
in
that
wonderful
city
not
because
of
the
gaieties
of
the
metropolis
for
of
those
i
knew
nothing
while
of
its
more
solid
attractions
my
ignorance
was
equally
great
so
long
as
my
books
retained
their
charms
i
had
no
appetite
for
other
recreations
or
attractions
the
busy
crowds
which
in
my
homeward
journey
pressed
past
me
on
all
sides
callous
as
to
my
welfare
and
heedless
of
my
existence
delighted
me
because
they
gave
me
with
a
sensation
which
thrilled
me
like
a
passion
the
enchantment
of
an
isolation
and
seclusion
greater
than
those
of
the
unpeopled
desert
when
i
arrived
at
home
i
gave
myself
up
unreservedly
to
the
enjoyment
of
my
library
my
rooms
were
comfortably
and
even
richly
furnished
and
the
apartments
themselves
were
of
imposing
dimensions
before
the
tide
of
fashion
had
rolled
westward
from
russell
square
the
house
in
which
i
lived
had
been
a
mansion
of
considerable
pretensions
and
this
to
suit
the
more
modest
requirements
of
the
new
class
of
tenants
now
occupying
the
square
had
been
divided
into
two
houses
the
cutting
of
the
house
in
two
had
resulted
oddly
at
some
points
and
in
my
rooms
signs
of
new
walls
foreign
to
the
original
design
of
the
building
were
discernible
as
were
also
two
massive
oaken
doorways
which
had
apparently
at
one
time
communicated
with
the
opposite
house
but
had
since
been
closed
up
of
these
two
doors
more
hereafter
the
bright
fire
the
light
the
dainty
surroundings
and
the
book
i
loved
suggested
something
of
a
sybaritish
existence
during
my
evenings
and
sometimes
my
conscience
pricked
me
about
yielding
so
unreservedly
to
what
certainly
was
a
most
pleasant
enjoyment
i
need
not
however
have
fretted
at
the
slender
dissipation
since
the
hour
was
already
on
the
wing
which
was
to
shatter
the
repose
of
my
life
into
fragments
and
to
tarnish
for
evermore
the
gold
with
which
these
earlier
days
were
being
perhaps
life
however
pleasant
had
seemed
tame
beside
the
dramas
of
literature
soon
fiction
was
to
pale
before
the
tragedies
of
fact
pasquale
called
upon
me
immediately
on
his
return
and
as
i
found
him
then
he
continued
without
change
until
the
end
bright
cheery
brilliant
and
debonair
his
sun
suffered
no
eclipse
until
it
sank
forever
our
acquaintance
soon
ripened
into
the
warmest
friendship
and
ere
long
the
wonderful
charm
of
his
manner
began
to
wean
me
from
the
books
which
had
hitherto
enslaved
me
when
at
no
lengthy
intervals
he
came
to
me
and
carry
me
off
for
a
long
walk
through
the
crowded
streets
i
closed
my
volume
with
ever
lessening
regret
his
powers
of
perception
naturally
great
had
been
trained
until
they
had
all
the
acuteness
of
the
most
delicate
sense
and
allied
to
a
mind
accustomed
to
reason
inductively
they
filled
his
brain
with
scenes
lost
to
the
ordinary
observer
at
the
first
glance
he
seemed
to
penetrate
the
mask
which
disguised
the
true
character
of
those
he
was
brought
in
contact
with
the
various
which
mark
the
human
visage
as
well
as
the
influences
which
mould
the
actions
of
the
body
seemed
alike
familiar
to
him
and
when
the
pros
and
cons
were
duly
weighed
in
his
logical
brain
the
real
character
of
the
individual
and
not
the
outward
pretence
lay
mapped
out
before
him
with
wonderful
accuracy
and
promptness
considering
the
inexactness
of
the
science
which
he
cultivated
hence
it
was
that
to
myself
wrapped
up
in
my
books
and
blind
to
the
outer
world
his
analysis
of
the
individuals
who
passed
us
in
our
nightly
walks
seemed
marvelous
in
the
extreme
occasionally
we
went
to
the
music
halls
but
i
think
that
catching
the
infection
from
my
friend
i
studied
the
onlookers
rather
than
the
somewhat
offensive
and
vulgar
display
on
the
boards
truth
to
tell
i
relished
company
a
great
deal
more
without
such
tawdry
surroundings
it
was
at
that
time
a
source
of
considerable
wonder
to
me
what
attraction
my
brilliant
friend
could
find
in
my
dull
society
and
i
sometimes
endured
the
passing
and
humiliating
reflection
that
he
simply
used
me
as
a
species
of
human
target
into
which
he
could
shoot
the
sharp
arrows
of
his
fancy
or
may
be
as
a
very
rough
commonplace
file
against
which
to
edge
them
occasionally
i
called
upon
my
friend
by
way
of
acknowledgment
of
his
many
visits
to
myself
but
i
must
have
been
very
unfortunate
for
the
answer
given
unhesitatingly
was
invariably
pasquale
has
gone
once
indeed
his
landlady
who
was
an
american
by
birth
told
the
servant
to
go
up
to
the
third
floor
and
see
whether
her
lodger
was
in
but
the
answer
received
was
the
same
is
not
at
strange
to
say
my
friend
who
was
so
communicative
on
impersonal
topics
was
so
reticent
about
his
own
affairs
that
this
was
the
first
intimation
i
had
received
as
to
the
floor
on
which
he
lived
live
on
the
third
floor
i
live
on
the
second
i
remarked
on
the
occasion
of
his
next
visit
anxious
to
furnish
something
new
to
the
conversation
he
remarked
by
way
of
reply
giving
me
i
fancied
a
sharp
glance
and
adding
quickly
did
you
discover
that
wyndham
when
i
told
him
he
smiled
and
then
added
go
out
a
great
deal
i
love
long
walks
and
am
quite
unable
to
bury
myself
in
books
as
you
do
my
friend
i
wish
you
would
come
with
me
more
this
for
my
society
was
entirely
unintelligible
to
me
for
marvelous
brightness
and
gaiety
rendered
my
own
stolidity
more
apparent
to
myself
day
by
day
no
discouragement
seemed
to
daunt
him
no
business
cares
worried
him
from
the
first
moment
that
he
joined
me
till
he
left
his
language
and
his
expression
were
radiant
with
humor
and
buoyant
of
money
troubles
he
had
or
appeared
to
have
none
and
he
explained
to
me
in
a
moment
of
exceptional
confidence
that
his
father
who
was
an
italian
had
sent
him
to
london
to
learn
the
there
in
order
that
he
might
eventually
open
a
branch
establishment
in
the
english
metropolis
have
no
extravagant
tastes
he
added
my
father
is
wealthy
and
generous
so
that
i
am
usually
well
in
funds
so
wyndham
if
ever
you
are
hard
up
you
must
make
me
your
little
by
little
this
strange
bright
creature
woke
me
from
my
dreams
until
at
length
for
the
first
time
since
my
arrival
in
london
i
felt
the
evenings
drag
when
he
failed
to
put
in
an
appearance
his
sunny
nature
had
become
to
me
a
panacea
for
all
the
dull
and
oppressive
cares
of
my
own
life
and
i
craved
for
his
company
in
which
nothing
sordid
or
gloomy
could
live
pasquale
in
spite
of
his
apparently
volatile
nature
was
a
great
reader
of
a
certain
class
of
books
as
well
as
a
close
student
of
human
nature
and
now
and
again
he
would
astonish
me
by
his
information
on
all
questions
touching
the
phenomena
of
mind
and
matter
friend
he
remarked
one
day
traverse
all
roads
at
intervals
and
therefore
cross
the
same
parallels
of
thought
again
and
again
i
only
travel
one
for
the
most
part
untrodden
and
on
that
lonely
and
fearsome
path
i
am
leagues
beyond
your
utmost
thought
and
that
of
i
think
every
other
human
being
in
fact
i
imagine
that
i
must
be
close
to
the
pole
of
human
search
anyhow
he
broke
off
merrily
feel
cold
enough
for
such
a
northern
latitude
and
am
glad
to
warm
myself
by
your
beautiful
shortly
after
this
i
felt
a
great
inclination
for
a
moonlight
sail
on
the
thames
and
having
received
an
invitation
to
join
a
boating
party
i
asked
permission
to
bring
my
friend
have
never
seen
the
thames
by
moonlight
i
remarked
to
him
i
am
told
that
it
is
lovely
beyond
description
on
thursday
next
it
will
be
will
you
come
i
had
spoken
warmly
in
my
anxiety
to
secure
his
company
but
he
answered
me
coldly
can
not
accompany
you
i
am
full
of
sympathies
and
antipathies
i
love
you
wyndham
as
much
i
think
as
life
itself
but
i
hate
and
loathe
the
moonlight
worse
than
death
stare
at
me
dear
boy
it
is
constitutional
and
can
not
be
rather
than
go
alone
or
leave
my
friend
i
gave
up
the
intended
trip
on
the
river
but
for
the
next
week
i
nevertheless
saw
nothing
of
him
he
was
reported
at
when
he
returned
he
informed
me
in
reply
to
my
inquiry
as
to
his
absence
that
he
had
been
called
out
of
town
he
had
often
been
absent
in
a
similar
way
before
and
the
occurrence
occasioned
me
no
surprise
shortly
after
this
i
was
sent
to
the
united
states
by
the
firm
i
represented
to
deliver
certain
papers
of
importance
to
a
client
in
chicago
as
i
was
about
to
leave
my
friend
pasquale
somewhat
surprised
me
by
saying
i
stand
this
place
without
you
so
i
think
i
shall
go
off
for
a
time
too
my
father
has
been
urging
me
for
a
long
while
to
take
a
two
holiday
and
has
recommended
norway
as
a
soothing
and
pleasant
recreation
sport
of
the
kind
would
be
worse
than
death
to
me
with
my
hatred
of
seeing
suffering
so
as
he
leaves
the
choice
to
me
i
am
thinking
of
going
over
to
paris
i
happen
to
know
the
chief
of
police
there
and
i
want
to
master
their
wonderful
detective
system
and
to
see
whether
i
am
right
in
supposing
that
i
know
more
than
others
do
about
the
peculiarities
of
the
human
mind
more
especially
in
its
relation
to
the
perpetration
of
crime
and
so
dear
old
friend
he
concluded
you
hear
of
any
wonderful
captures
during
your
absence
look
out
for
my
name
and
so
we
parted
with
on
my
side
many
a
yearning
heartache
for
the
friend
i
was
leaving
behind
me
as
the
stately
cunarder
carrying
me
on
board
steamed
out
from
liverpool
the
same
day
a
channel
boat
bore
pasquale
from
dover
to
calais
chapter
iii
when
i
arrived
in
new
york
i
had
not
much
opportunity
of
reading
up
back
numbers
of
the
daily
papers
but
i
was
startled
to
see
that
the
chief
commissioner
of
the
london
police
sir
charles
pendreth
had
been
found
dead
in
his
bed
by
his
own
hand
and
that
immediately
following
upon
his
suicide
had
occurred
that
of
two
of
the
leading
police
magistrates
of
the
metropolis
these
occurrences
dire
enough
in
themselves
were
rendered
still
more
terrible
by
the
fact
that
each
had
killed
himself
in
the
same
way
by
severing
his
jugular
vein
with
his
razor
and
had
left
behind
him
a
letter
in
his
handwriting
explaining
why
he
had
committed
in
the
case
of
the
first
suicide
the
jury
had
found
considerable
difficulty
in
avoiding
a
verdict
of
as
the
letter
left
behind
displayed
so
manifest
a
purpose
but
in
the
other
cases
the
deaths
were
unhesitatingly
attributed
to
the
spreading
of
an
epidemic
of
suicide
and
the
verdict
of
temporary
insanity
rendered
in
both
instances
threw
a
merciful
veil
over
the
intentions
of
the
on
my
return
to
new
york
from
chicago
i
found
a
letter
awaiting
me
it
was
from
my
friend
pasquale
and
the
sight
of
his
handwriting
thrilled
me
with
joy
heaven
alone
knew
how
dry
and
barren
my
life
had
seemed
without
him
all
these
long
weeks
spent
in
dreary
uninteresting
travel
pasquale
stated
in
his
letter
that
he
had
found
his
stay
in
paris
very
agreeable
i
winced
jealously
at
the
thought
and
instructive
and
that
while
there
he
had
seen
no
reason
to
moderate
his
views
as
to
his
ability
to
unravel
any
criminal
plot
or
to
account
for
any
mental
obliquity
and
in
virtue
of
this
additional
confidence
in
himself
and
of
the
further
experience
which
he
had
gained
he
proposed
to
go
to
london
shortly
to
endeavor
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
terrible
mania
for
in
that
city
letter
was
dated
the
of
october
he
hoped
to
arrive
in
london
on
the
so
did
i
thank
god
my
old
friend
and
i
would
soon
meet
on
the
of
november
the
good
ship
landed
me
safely
in
liverpool
and
at
the
same
evening
my
cab
drove
up
to
the
door
of
no
russell
square
as
i
descended
from
my
cumbersome
i
noticed
a
hansom
cab
dash
up
to
the
adjoining
house
and
words
would
fail
me
to
express
the
rapture
with
which
i
saw
my
friend
alight
his
welcome
was
like
a
bath
of
electrified
sunshine
so
gay
so
bright
and
thrilling
was
it
in
its
and
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
his
portmanteau
safely
housed
he
turned
to
me
his
whole
voice
vibrating
with
pleasure
i
ask
you
into
my
dull
quarters
but
you
and
i
must
see
much
of
each
other
to
make
up
for
our
long
separation
so
as
soon
as
we
have
taken
our
baths
and
a
chop
i
will
run
in
to
spend
a
couple
of
hours
with
you
and
got
some
lovely
french
cognac
which
the
occasion
will
absolve
us
for
using
dear
dear
wyndham
on
my
soul
glad
to
see
you
and
before
i
could
retreat
much
to
my
embarrassment
he
had
clasped
me
by
the
shoulder
and
imprinted
a
hearty
kiss
first
on
one
cheek
and
then
on
the
other
missed
you
more
than
tongue
can
tell
he
continued
and
as
he
spoke
the
tears
in
his
voice
made
it
husky
as
the
glad
mist
in
my
own
eyes
made
my
vision
dim
i
noticed
that
pasquale
had
brought
back
a
french
valet
with
him
from
paris
a
tall
muscular
and
rather
forbidding
man
in
appearance
with
the
stamp
of
the
army
or
police
about
his
square
shoulders
stiff
neck
and
mechanical
step
old
army
man
i
murmured
to
myself
servant
most
are
becoming
somewhat
more
fastidious
my
friend
i
remarked
in
reference
to
the
valet
no
wyndham
was
the
reply
is
supposed
to
be
my
valet
but
he
is
in
reality
a
detective
to
help
me
in
the
work
of
penetrating
the
english
mystery
sometimes
one
good
clue
becomes
lost
while
you
are
hunting
up
another
and
duty
will
be
to
follow
the
scent
before
it
grows
cold
while
i
am
doing
something
else
but
pray
tell
anyone
about
what
a
delightful
couple
of
hours
we
spent
as
the
clock
struck
eleven
my
friend
rose
to
go
by
that
time
he
had
given
me
a
full
history
of
his
doings
in
paris
and
it
would
certainly
have
been
difficult
for
a
less
enterprising
individual
to
have
managed
to
accomplish
so
much
of
actual
work
and
positive
enjoyment
in
so
short
a
time
you
never
visited
london
at
all
during
those
two
months
i
inquired
once
was
the
reply
should
have
hated
to
visit
my
old
haunts
while
you
were
with
pasquale
back
the
old
days
returned
bringing
with
them
the
sunshine
which
seemed
to
crown
him
like
a
nimbus
and
scatter
its
radiance
all
around
as
i
stood
by
the
old
carved
mantelpiece
winding
up
my
watch
after
the
door
closed
on
him
that
evening
my
heart
was
full
of
an
exhilarating
gaiety
to
which
it
had
long
been
a
stranger
if
i
a
man
by
nature
harsh
and
cold
regarded
pasquale
with
such
tender
feelings
what
emotions
must
he
arouse
in
the
gentler
sex
and
what
unutterable
havoc
must
he
work
with
their
tender
susceptibilities
while
this
thought
was
exercising
my
brain
and
as
i
turned
into
the
inner
room
i
became
conscious
of
a
deep
groan
uttered
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
blind
doorway
which
stood
between
my
bedroom
and
the
room
on
the
same
floor
in
the
adjoining
house
i
recollected
that
pasquale
had
informed
me
that
the
floor
under
him
that
is
the
one
adjoining
my
rooms
was
occupied
by
a
troublesome
old
frenchman
whose
peculiar
ways
gave
the
people
of
the
house
a
good
deal
of
trouble
i
waited
for
a
time
in
silence
but
the
groan
was
not
repeated
and
eventually
i
retired
to
rest
and
to
enjoy
an
unbroken
and
dreamless
sleep
i
awoke
somewhat
late
the
following
morning
and
as
i
was
not
obliged
to
report
myself
at
the
office
at
the
usual
hour
on
that
occasion
and
as
i
was
moreover
somewhat
fatigued
i
proposed
to
enjoy
my
breakfast
in
bed
and
my
newspaper
as
well
to
me
an
unprecedented
luxury
if
i
had
anticipated
that
my
morning
meal
should
be
enjoyed
in
comfort
i
was
doomed
to
be
disappointed
for
i
had
scarcely
tasted
my
food
before
a
thundering
knock
at
the
door
announced
my
friend
pasquale
who
burst
into
my
room
newspaper
in
hand
and
with
outstretched
finger
pointed
to
the
giant
head
lines
on
the
newspaper
suicide
death
of
inspector
reynolds
by
his
own
my
friend
you
will
see
whether
my
boasted
skill
is
of
any
use
if
i
do
not
prove
to
your
satisfaction
that
there
is
something
more
in
these
suicides
than
meets
the
eye
i
will
agree
to
forfeit
everything
in
i
was
thunderstruck
and
horrified
i
pushed
the
paper
away
from
me
with
the
first
trace
of
genuine
impatience
which
i
think
i
had
ever
displayed
towards
my
friend
your
horrid
sheet
away
pasquale
i
exclaimed
understand
your
ghoulish
glee
but
my
voice
failed
me
when
i
saw
the
look
of
pain
and
remorse
which
crossed
his
face
i
swear
to
you
before
god
he
replied
with
an
earnestness
which
it
is
pitiful
to
remember
i
would
not
injure
a
hair
of
head
whom
the
good
lord
has
made
no
not
for
life
itself
if
i
knew
my
friend
left
shortly
afterwards
cast
down
it
seemed
to
me
in
spite
of
my
reiterated
assurance
that
i
had
spoken
hastily
and
tetchily
having
only
just
been
waked
out
of
my
sleep
when
i
returned
to
my
apartments
that
evening
there
had
been
up
to
that
time
no
indication
of
any
clue
to
the
cause
of
the
suicide
beyond
the
strange
unsatisfactory
letter
which
as
in
the
other
cases
of
suicide
had
been
left
behind
him
by
the
dead
man
and
the
condition
of
the
public
mind
was
in
consequence
one
of
profound
horror
and
anxiety
i
had
hardly
dared
to
hope
that
my
friend
pasquale
would
forget
the
hastiness
of
my
greeting
so
far
as
to
call
upon
me
and
i
was
accordingly
relieved
beyond
measure
when
i
heard
the
old
familiar
knock
he
came
in
with
at
first
a
glance
askance
almost
of
timidity
such
a
glance
as
a
loving
woman
might
give
to
an
offended
and
friend
when
he
noticed
my
shamefacedness
he
advanced
gracefully
towards
me
with
outstretched
hands
looking
altogether
too
pretty
a
picture
to
waste
on
a
briton
and
added
hugely
to
my
embarrassment
by
kissing
me
softly
on
either
cheek
that
terrible
foreign
fashion
would
i
ever
get
accustomed
to
it
god
wyndham
you
and
i
are
all
right
if
we
were
to
quarrel
i
should
give
everything
up
in
the
evening
passed
as
a
hundred
others
had
gone
before
it
in
controversy
brilliant
and
conclusive
on
the
one
side
and
stupid
and
dogmatic
on
the
other
obstinacy
almost
converts
me
it
is
so
magnificent
in
its
contempt
of
law
and
such
was
the
parthian
shaft
which
pasquale
launched
as
he
bowed
himself
out
genial
and
smiling
as
if
our
every
sentence
had
been
a
harmonious
duet
but
the
parting
words
rankled
in
my
sensitive
breast
and
as
the
door
closed
behind
my
friend
i
sat
still
and
silent
in
a
cold
defiant
mood
old
friend
said
a
soft
and
musical
voice
at
my
elbow
my
banter
i
sleep
a
wink
if
you
shake
hands
with
pasquale
had
softly
the
room
and
stood
gazing
at
me
with
a
tender
wistful
look
i
gave
him
my
hand
somewhat
grudgingly
it
pains
me
to
remember
and
after
one
glance
at
the
pathetic
eyes
i
resumed
my
stare
at
the
dying
embers
oh
memory
oh
days
and
years
that
have
been
how
much
more
bitter
than
death
itself
are
your
whisperings
of
lost
opportunities
of
loving
deeds
undone
loving
words
unsaid
of
loving
glances
withheld
after
pasquale
had
gone
i
sat
for
a
while
reflecting
on
what
he
had
told
me
about
the
result
of
his
preliminary
investigations
into
the
cause
of
the
epidemic
of
suicide
which
was
paralyzing
the
entire
city
one
peculiar
feature
of
these
horrors
he
had
especially
dwelt
upon
namely
the
fact
that
in
each
case
the
suicide
had
left
a
letter
stating
that
he
had
determined
to
take
his
own
life
as
to
the
authenticity
of
these
letters
the
authorities
appeared
to
have
no
doubt
whatever
on
comparison
with
other
specimens
of
the
dead
handwriting
they
could
not
it
was
declared
be
called
in
question
then
too
there
was
the
extraordinary
similarity
as
to
method
each
man
had
with
great
deliberation
severed
his
jugular
vein
using
for
the
purpose
his
own
razor
which
in
every
instance
had
been
found
firmly
clasped
in
the
right
hand
of
the
suicide
press
call
it
a
contagion
of
suicide
pasquale
had
said
with
a
smile
of
contempt
which
had
roused
my
easily
stirred
ire
i
say
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
it
is
murder
and
not
suicide
and
i
will
prove
it
yes
that
had
been
the
absurdly
egotistical
remark
which
had
finally
exhausted
my
forbearance
i
had
no
patience
with
such
ideas
during
the
next
week
i
saw
nothing
of
my
volatile
friend
and
when
he
finally
made
his
appearance
he
looked
pale
and
i
imagined
thinner
have
been
called
away
he
explained
to
me
during
this
visit
i
must
now
redouble
my
efforts
to
work
out
my
theory
as
to
those
on
the
next
occasion
when
he
visited
my
rooms
he
told
me
with
great
exultation
that
he
had
at
length
received
from
a
prominent
expert
in
handwriting
the
assurance
after
a
searching
examination
that
the
letters
purporting
to
have
been
written
by
the
poor
suicides
had
all
been
penned
by
the
same
hand
and
that
on
careful
comparison
although
wonderful
forgeries
they
were
all
essentially
different
in
character
from
the
handwritings
of
the
dead
men
is
the
opinion
of
the
expert
i
employed
continued
pasquale
looking
to
the
gravity
of
the
subject
and
the
responsibility
of
making
so
serious
a
statement
before
handing
his
written
report
to
me
he
has
taken
the
precaution
to
obtain
the
opinion
of
two
other
experts
on
the
subject
these
opinions
continued
my
friend
with
something
of
the
exultation
which
had
previously
repelled
me
endorse
the
views
of
the
expert
which
i
when
pasquale
produced
the
letter
received
from
his
expert
i
found
that
his
statement
had
in
nowise
been
exaggerated
the
original
view
and
the
opinions
endorsing
it
written
in
cold
and
language
rested
in
my
hand
for
a
moment
then
i
dropped
the
dread
papers
on
the
table
as
i
would
have
thrown
from
my
grasp
a
cluster
of
poisonous
reptiles
i
was
horrified
and
expressed
myself
so
i
had
never
before
it
seemed
to
me
been
in
such
proximity
to
crime
and
i
shuddered
at
the
contact
with
this
terrible
link
that
is
not
all
resumed
my
friend
death
wounds
were
not
made
by
the
razors
grasped
in
the
hands
of
the
dead
men
or
at
least
not
in
the
case
of
the
last
victim
for
unfortunately
the
bodies
of
the
others
have
been
interred
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
examine
them
razor
cuts
with
a
slash
or
gash
but
it
does
not
and
can
not
make
a
stab
whereas
in
the
last
case
there
was
first
of
all
a
stab
penetrating
far
into
the
neck
and
that
was
followed
by
a
long
cut
which
severed
the
great
artery
and
all
the
surrounding
flesh
that
is
to
say
the
murderer
thrust
the
knife
into
the
neck
then
drew
it
towards
himself
and
then
the
deed
was
as
my
friend
spoke
carried
away
by
his
subject
apparently
and
insensible
to
its
revolting
character
i
grew
dumb
petrified
with
the
horror
of
his
revelations
his
eyes
always
brilliant
shone
large
and
clear
and
seemed
to
stand
out
from
the
pale
ivory
features
there
was
in
his
appearance
the
force
and
pride
of
elucidation
which
a
successful
counsel
might
show
in
entangling
the
criminal
in
the
noose
destined
to
terminate
his
existence
but
there
was
more
than
that
there
was
the
physical
and
mental
ardor
of
the
chase
and
the
flash
of
eye
and
teeth
which
the
zulu
caffre
shows
when
he
poises
his
willing
spear
to
flesh
it
in
his
human
victims
do
you
know
he
went
on
while
i
grew
sick
and
giddy
beneath
the
horror
of
his
narration
and
the
uncanny
mesmerism
of
his
eyes
murderer
whoever
he
was
must
after
all
have
been
a
bungler
for
just
think
of
it
would
any
man
who
had
killed
himself
with
the
cold
premeditation
shown
by
those
letters
have
done
so
without
first
removing
the
linen
from
his
neck
and
otherwise
preparing
himself
when
facing
the
scaffold
the
murderer
dresses
in
his
best
and
however
brutal
and
even
brutish
he
may
have
been
in
life
he
gives
much
and
careful
thought
to
looking
decent
after
death
it
seems
absurd
of
course
this
anxiety
as
to
how
one
will
look
after
death
more
especially
where
as
in
the
case
of
the
murderer
the
body
will
be
given
up
to
the
tender
mercies
of
quick
lime
in
an
hour
or
two
and
yet
that
this
feeling
does
exist
is
admitted
by
every
person
does
not
one
of
your
great
english
poets
in
ruling
passion
strong
in
put
these
words
into
the
mouth
of
the
dying
coquette
would
not
sure
be
frightful
when
dead
and
betty
give
this
cheek
a
little
red
these
men
died
in
each
instance
without
the
slightest
regard
for
the
of
life
or
death
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
speak
deprecatingly
of
the
dead
they
had
not
an
atom
of
regard
for
after
appearances
and
glaringly
belied
human
experience
but
unfortunate
men
that
was
no
fault
of
theirs
they
were
in
fact
surprised
in
the
seclusion
of
their
own
rooms
where
all
busy
and
wearied
men
thinking
themselves
secure
from
intrusion
avail
themselves
to
the
utmost
of
the
few
opportunities
they
have
of
being
comfortably
they
died
without
leaving
behind
them
the
faintest
trace
of
any
preparation
beyond
these
formal
letters
announcing
their
intentions
such
letters
as
by
the
way
are
rarely
written
by
intending
suicides
is
probably
not
one
man
amongst
the
millions
on
this
globe
who
if
calmly
contemplating
suicide
would
not
leave
behind
him
some
evidence
of
preparation
for
the
event
some
last
duty
done
some
last
message
of
love
or
upbraiding
to
be
delivered
yet
i
have
been
informed
on
good
authority
that
there
was
in
every
instance
an
absolute
omission
of
any
such
farewell
message
as
well
as
of
all
sign
of
preparation
the
contrary
there
is
considerable
confusion
in
the
business
and
also
in
the
domestic
affairs
of
the
dead
men
such
as
from
their
methodical
habits
they
would
have
been
certain
to
provide
against
had
they
foreseen
their
end
even
thirty
minutes
looking
to
the
utter
absence
in
this
case
of
that
studied
decorum
in
death
observed
by
all
men
who
do
not
slay
themselves
in
the
heat
of
passion
and
also
to
the
total
lack
of
arrangement
in
the
affairs
these
facts
alone
would
go
far
to
prove
that
the
dead
men
did
not
kill
themselves
but
taking
them
in
conjunction
with
the
revealed
forgeries
why
then
i
say
that
the
verdict
of
suicide
is
not
to
be
maintained
for
a
moment
even
that
is
not
yet
and
as
my
friend
resumed
he
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
fire
and
force
in
his
whole
aspect
which
together
with
his
marvelous
theory
affected
me
so
powerfully
that
i
too
rose
in
sympathy
and
we
faced
each
other
pale
as
death
on
the
hearthrug
and
the
words
came
almost
hissing
from
his
lips
men
were
not
by
the
wounds
in
their
throats
they
were
killed
or
at
least
the
last
one
was
killed
by
the
previous
perforation
of
the
base
of
the
skull
by
a
powerful
needle
or
bodkin
i
found
a
small
bluish
colored
puncture
at
that
point
on
the
head
of
the
last
victim
and
on
following
it
up
by
my
directions
the
surgeon
discovered
embedded
in
the
brain
and
penetrating
half
way
through
its
entire
depth
the
blade
of
a
small
dagger
protested
my
friend
as
i
was
about
to
speak
is
not
all
the
blade
had
not
been
broken
off
it
had
been
released
or
discharged
from
its
handle
by
a
powerful
spring
at
the
moment
of
the
stab
with
the
intent
that
it
should
remain
in
the
skull
just
beneath
the
surface
and
so
stop
all
hemorrhage
and
every
trace
of
it
be
removed
by
the
closing
of
the
skin
over
it
and
by
the
natural
covering
of
the
hair
even
if
the
wound
should
bleed
a
little
the
result
would
naturally
be
attributed
to
the
greater
wound
in
the
throat
now
my
friend
can
you
conceive
a
more
hideous
plot
or
one
more
fiendish
in
its
ingenuity
when
pasquale
had
finished
i
felt
benumbed
with
the
force
and
fervor
of
his
presentment
of
the
case
to
me
he
was
no
longer
the
gay
and
brilliant
friend
but
the
fierce
and
beautiful
avenging
angel
of
the
murdered
men
and
repelled
though
i
was
by
the
horror
which
surrounded
the
series
of
crimes
i
felt
eager
to
aid
him
in
his
work
of
discovery
you
taken
any
steps
to
find
out
whether
the
previous
deaths
were
caused
in
the
same
way
as
i
put
this
question
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
austere
valet
handed
his
master
a
letter
which
had
just
arrived
and
which
being
marked
he
explained
he
had
taken
the
liberty
of
delivering
at
once
in
silence
pasquale
handed
me
the
letter
which
stated
briefly
that
in
deference
to
his
request
an
order
had
been
obtained
to
exhume
the
bodies
of
the
supposed
suicides
with
the
result
that
in
each
case
the
same
needle
or
dagger
point
had
been
found
in
the
skulls
of
the
deceased
the
writer
in
conclusion
intimated
that
the
bodies
would
be
held
until
noon
the
following
day
in
case
pasquale
should
wish
to
make
any
further
inspection
himself
as
i
handed
back
the
letter
pasquale
dashed
off
a
few
lines
by
way
of
courteous
acknowledgment
and
stating
that
he
would
avail
himself
of
the
offer
and
call
and
examine
the
bodies
the
following
day
that
night
was
one
of
the
most
agitated
and
unrestful
in
my
hitherto
placid
life
for
hours
after
pasquale
left
i
paced
the
floor
of
my
room
possessed
with
a
fever
of
unrest
and
a
frenzy
of
excitement
which
tore
through
my
soul
as
a
cyclone
sweeps
unresistingly
through
a
bed
of
reeds
by
the
morning
every
thought
and
aspiration
of
my
life
lay
prostrate
before
the
one
consuming
desire
to
bring
the
murderer
to
justice
at
nine
i
arrived
at
my
office
pale
and
haggard
and
a
few
minutes
later
i
left
to
accompany
my
friend
excused
from
duty
on
the
plea
of
urgent
business
when
pasquale
and
i
entered
the
mortuary
chamber
where
the
bodies
awaited
us
i
shuddered
for
a
moment
and
drew
back
i
had
never
seen
a
dead
body
and
my
whole
soul
shrunk
from
the
sight
of
a
victims
in
the
various
stages
of
decay
but
after
a
time
my
courage
returned
or
it
were
perhaps
more
correct
to
say
a
new
impulse
possessed
me
and
i
went
through
the
ordeal
of
the
morning
without
further
display
of
weakness
there
was
little
additional
evidence
gleaned
but
when
the
four
dagger
points
which
had
been
the
means
used
to
kill
the
murdered
men
lay
side
by
side
on
the
table
they
were
found
to
be
exact
in
size
and
shape
thereby
proving
beyond
all
doubt
that
the
same
hand
had
wrought
all
the
murders
my
friend
who
was
examining
the
weapons
carefully
under
the
microscope
murmured
to
himself
seratzzi
venice
and
in
response
to
the
inquiry
of
my
eyes
he
replied
nearly
as
i
can
decipher
it
for
the
rust
that
is
the
name
of
the
maker
of
these
daggers
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
heard
of
them
before
though
for
my
life
i
recollect
where
or
in
what
connection
and
he
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
as
if
he
were
trying
to
recollect
chapter
iv
the
publication
of
the
discovery
that
the
supposed
suicides
were
in
reality
murders
committed
by
the
same
individual
filled
london
with
horror
which
was
intensified
a
by
the
knowledge
that
the
murderer
was
still
at
large
the
metropolitan
police
even
when
put
upon
the
right
track
failed
to
discover
any
clue
of
the
murderer
and
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
all
they
could
say
in
the
way
of
elucidation
was
that
an
aged
man
with
long
white
hair
had
been
seen
near
the
scene
of
each
of
the
murders
at
the
time
of
the
occurrence
and
prior
to
it
there
was
nothing
especially
suspicious
in
his
actions
or
appearance
and
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
neighborhood
at
the
time
might
simply
be
a
coincidence
or
the
various
testimony
might
not
even
refer
to
the
same
individual
for
elderly
men
are
not
at
all
uncommon
in
london
that
the
police
should
attach
any
importance
to
so
faint
a
clue
was
perhaps
the
best
evidence
of
their
admission
how
completely
they
were
baffled
so
at
least
the
public
considered
and
the
newspapers
jeered
the
officials
for
their
inefficiency
meantime
my
friend
continued
his
investigation
with
unabated
ardor
and
night
after
night
in
the
quiet
of
my
bachelor
rooms
we
discussed
each
point
of
evidence
however
slight
and
classified
or
dismissed
it
according
to
its
value
pasquale
surrendered
everything
to
the
discovery
of
the
dreadful
mystery
and
he
grew
thin
and
as
the
days
passed
by
without
throwing
any
further
light
upon
it
these
were
days
to
hilarity
and
much
of
the
gaiety
of
sunny
ways
faded
before
their
chilling
influences
still
if
the
efflorescence
of
his
disposition
seemed
shed
for
the
time
the
fact
only
served
to
reveal
the
true
beauty
of
soul
which
was
the
foundation
of
all
i
loved
so
much
save
when
crossed
by
the
sight
of
suffering
uselessly
inflicted
upon
the
lower
animals
i
think
he
was
the
sweetest
gentlest
creature
god
ever
made
and
the
most
lovable
yet
so
inexorable
in
hunting
down
the
assassin
the
reader
will
say
and
i
answer
yes
of
the
secret
of
that
involved
mechanism
which
formed
soul
i
had
no
key
i
only
know
that
to
me
my
friend
was
like
the
fascinating
page
of
some
book
blurred
and
unintelligible
here
and
maybe
there
but
still
sweeter
in
its
occasional
illegibility
than
all
the
other
volumes
on
earth
combined
at
the
end
of
the
third
week
of
search
valet
called
to
explain
that
his
master
had
suddenly
been
summoned
abroad
to
a
family
council
but
that
his
absence
would
probably
not
extend
beyond
a
week
if
i
could
ever
have
found
it
in
my
heart
to
be
vexed
with
pasquale
it
would
have
been
over
his
habit
of
obeying
those
calls
so
promptly
as
not
even
to
allow
himself
time
to
bid
me
your
master
leave
no
message
jacques
i
inquired
puzzled
to
account
for
the
absence
of
any
further
explanation
sir
he
left
in
haste
and
ordered
me
to
present
his
apologies
to
you
for
his
omission
to
call
and
say
i
looked
at
the
speaker
and
endeavored
to
read
his
expression
but
the
eyes
dropped
the
moment
they
encountered
my
gaze
and
the
cruel
lips
and
formidable
jaw
together
with
the
eyes
made
one
of
the
most
unpleasing
masks
it
had
ever
been
my
evil
fortune
to
gaze
upon
i
thought
of
the
masks
of
murderers
in
madame
chamber
of
horrors
and
began
to
regard
my
visitor
with
a
curious
interest
you
have
a
glass
of
brandy
jacques
i
inquired
piqued
by
the
impenetrability
and
trusting
to
the
liquor
to
thaw
it
you
but
the
potent
liquor
served
only
to
harden
the
deep
lines
which
guarded
the
reticent
lips
and
after
i
had
measured
the
implacable
face
and
found
no
encouragement
there
i
said
that
is
all
and
with
a
low
bow
the
inscrutable
valet
or
detective
left
after
he
had
closed
the
door
i
amused
myself
by
sketching
his
head
in
profile
upon
the
blotting
pad
as
the
sketch
lay
before
me
it
certainly
did
not
represent
according
to
either
phrenologists
or
physiognomists
a
bad
or
wicked
head
it
was
simply
the
side
face
of
a
determined
man
and
one
possessed
of
considerable
possibility
of
lofty
purpose
i
tossed
the
paper
from
me
disappointed
in
the
sketch
even
more
than
i
had
been
in
the
original
on
the
fourth
day
after
my
friend
had
left
i
was
aroused
at
an
early
hour
by
the
valet
who
after
apologizing
for
the
intrusion
handed
me
the
morning
paper
and
pointed
to
the
announcement
of
another
suicide
by
a
public
functionary
and
under
circumstances
precisely
similar
to
the
cases
which
had
preceded
it
as
in
the
other
instances
the
hand
grasped
a
razor
to
account
for
the
deep
wound
in
his
throat
while
his
death
was
in
reality
due
to
the
puncture
of
the
brain
by
the
concealed
dagger
point
my
instant
impulse
was
to
telegraph
for
my
friend
to
enable
him
to
take
up
the
scent
while
it
was
fresh
i
accordingly
framed
a
message
for
the
valet
to
send
in
his
own
name
and
this
i
still
in
bed
requested
him
to
dispatch
at
four
in
the
afternoon
i
received
a
note
from
the
valet
to
the
effect
that
he
had
heard
from
his
master
and
that
the
latter
would
be
with
me
the
following
morning
me
see
the
cablegram
you
received
that
i
have
destroyed
it
replied
that
irritating
individual
i
thought
that
in
a
gentle
and
careless
way
i
would
hint
to
my
friend
that
however
faithful
a
valet
or
detective
jacques
might
be
something
less
like
a
sphinx
would
better
meet
the
exigencies
of
ordinary
life
i
was
undergoing
a
childish
fit
of
annoyance
the
evening
papers
gave
full
details
of
the
suicide
and
also
announced
the
fact
that
a
individual
such
as
the
police
had
connected
with
the
previous
crimes
had
been
seen
in
the
vicinity
of
the
suicide
and
had
been
traced
such
was
the
condition
of
affairs
when
my
friend
covered
with
the
dust
of
travel
entered
my
room
the
following
morning
at
his
urgent
and
indeed
impassioned
request
i
obtained
leave
of
absence
from
the
office
that
day
in
order
to
aid
him
in
following
the
clues
left
by
the
murderer
while
they
were
still
fresh
as
i
left
my
apartments
with
my
friend
i
caught
sight
of
his
valet
standing
at
the
entrance
to
the
adjoining
house
his
usually
stolid
face
seemed
to
be
expressive
of
anxiety
and
once
or
twice
he
moved
as
if
about
to
speak
he
had
however
all
his
life
long
cultivated
a
habit
of
silence
and
in
his
present
spasm
of
uncertainty
it
prevailed
i
saw
or
appeared
to
see
a
struggle
going
on
in
his
mind
but
i
had
no
clue
to
his
apprehensions
and
the
symptoms
of
his
distress
were
too
indefinite
and
too
fleeting
to
justify
action
on
my
part
and
unwarned
unchecked
by
the
hand
which
still
even
at
the
eleventh
hour
might
have
changed
it
my
friend
pasquale
and
i
went
forward
to
fulfil
our
destinies
i
would
fain
draw
a
curtain
over
the
events
of
the
following
hours
they
have
darkened
my
life
and
they
will
shorten
my
days
pasquale
and
i
examined
each
detail
of
the
murder
but
without
throwing
further
light
upon
it
the
police
on
their
part
followed
up
step
by
step
the
retreat
of
the
murderer
only
however
to
lose
him
at
cross
he
had
been
too
astute
to
hail
a
cab
and
the
numerous
exits
afforded
by
that
teeming
centre
gave
him
all
the
facilities
for
escape
which
he
needed
when
we
parted
for
the
night
it
was
in
disheartened
silence
true
pasquale
looked
bright
and
cheery
as
usual
but
i
knew
by
my
own
feelings
that
he
must
be
as
low
in
spirits
as
could
well
be
in
vain
i
strove
to
bury
myself
in
an
agreeable
book
i
could
not
read
and
i
could
not
rest
at
length
worn
out
by
the
fierce
though
fruitless
emotions
i
threw
myself
tired
and
worn
out
on
my
bed
and
after
a
while
i
fell
into
a
deep
and
dreamless
sleep
presently
i
awoke
suddenly
and
keenly
conscious
of
the
near
happening
of
some
event
of
stupendous
importance
the
fire
in
the
grate
was
still
burning
brightly
so
that
i
had
not
slept
long
why
had
i
awoke
so
soon
and
in
such
a
startled
and
expectant
state
there
was
no
apparent
reason
within
my
room
but
hark
what
was
that
clearly
and
distinctly
as
if
there
were
no
obstructing
walls
i
could
hear
the
noise
made
by
the
tenant
of
the
neighboring
rooms
as
he
prepared
himself
to
retire
for
the
night
the
sound
of
each
movement
fell
on
my
ear
in
my
then
state
of
tension
with
all
the
clearness
of
a
bell
i
could
even
hear
his
muttered
conversation
the
latter
seemed
to
be
of
so
strange
and
disjointed
a
character
that
my
curiosity
overcoming
me
i
stooped
and
applied
my
ear
to
the
keyhole
of
the
oaken
door
which
divided
our
rooms
believing
that
some
demented
person
had
gained
wrongful
access
to
the
adjoining
rooms
my
view
was
limited
to
a
few
seconds
at
the
end
of
which
the
other
door
which
fronted
the
one
in
my
own
wall
was
abruptly
closed
but
in
that
limited
time
my
eye
had
garnered
a
terrible
harvest
for
in
the
muttering
inmate
of
the
adjoining
room
i
had
identified
or
imagined
i
had
identified
the
murderer
as
described
by
all
who
had
seen
him
not
indeed
identified
to
me
by
the
whiteness
of
his
hair
and
his
age
only
but
by
the
hands
which
he
removed
from
his
gloves
and
by
the
weapon
which
he
laid
upon
his
table
what
to
do
i
knew
not
and
horrified
beyond
measure
i
lay
in
my
bed
petrified
with
apprehension
waiting
for
the
dawn
with
the
first
glimmer
of
dawn
i
sent
next
door
for
my
friend
and
explained
to
him
my
midnight
experiences
is
very
strange
he
murmured
strange
who
do
you
think
lives
opposite
to
you
from
the
glance
he
gave
me
it
was
evident
that
my
friend
thought
i
had
taken
leave
of
my
senses
the
old
frenchman
you
told
me
of
i
replied
frenchman
he
returned
with
an
air
of
puzzled
surprise
and
interrogation
i
say
an
old
frenchman
lived
over
against
you
you
misunderstood
me
i
think
he
occupies
the
rooms
to
the
it
was
there
that
i
heard
the
noise
and
saw
the
man
i
replied
a
look
of
pain
and
perplexity
had
come
into
my
face
and
for
a
few
minutes
he
sat
in
silence
apparently
lost
in
thought
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
turned
towards
the
door
adding
as
he
opened
it
soon
as
you
have
breakfasted
i
would
like
you
to
accompany
me
to
the
police
station
i
think
you
ought
to
tell
the
officers
what
you
there
was
still
the
same
look
of
puzzled
uncertainty
in
my
face
as
well
as
an
anxious
glance
as
if
for
my
welfare
but
there
was
also
a
look
of
unutterable
resolution
as
he
said
as
if
to
himself
must
be
no
hesitation
this
thing
has
to
be
gone
an
hour
later
pasquale
and
i
arrived
at
the
police
station
and
half
an
hour
afterwards
two
police
officers
two
detectives
pasquale
and
myself
left
for
my
house
on
the
way
thither
pasquale
stepped
aside
to
make
a
small
purchase
straight
on
i
will
follow
you
in
a
minute
i
have
left
my
in
another
pocket
so
you
must
knock
for
these
gentlemen
up
to
the
third
such
was
the
orders
to
the
servant
when
we
requested
to
be
shown
to
rooms
where
we
were
to
mature
our
plans
when
the
servant
reached
the
second
floor
she
threw
open
the
front
door
and
stood
aside
to
allow
us
to
enter
is
not
the
third
floor
my
good
girl
exclaimed
the
senior
constable
is
the
second
sir
mistress
calls
it
the
third
floor
the
servant
replied
at
this
moment
pasquale
who
had
joined
us
remarked
pleasantly
girl
is
right
her
mistress
is
an
american
and
counts
the
as
the
first
floor
these
are
the
rooms
which
i
sir
exclaimed
the
reassured
servant
are
my
brain
was
in
a
perfect
whirl
these
my
rooms
i
had
always
imagined
that
he
lived
on
the
floor
above
misled
by
the
american
method
of
reckoning
the
floors
i
glanced
at
pasquale
but
he
was
unconscious
of
my
look
turning
to
the
servant
he
said
your
mistress
that
the
police
wish
to
inspect
rooms
and
bring
us
the
key
of
his
leon
goddecourt
is
the
elderly
french
gentleman
i
spoke
to
you
about
as
occupying
the
rooms
at
the
this
was
explanation
to
me
when
the
servant
returned
with
the
key
pasquale
led
the
way
into
the
passage
communicating
with
the
rooms
at
the
back
the
occupant
of
the
rooms
was
absent
and
there
was
no
hindrance
to
an
exhaustive
examination
there
was
no
door
connecting
with
the
rooms
of
the
house
in
which
i
lived
nothing
was
discovered
the
police
were
turning
to
go
impressed
i
believe
with
the
idea
that
i
had
been
hoaxing
them
or
else
that
the
excitement
of
the
murder
had
driven
me
crazy
for
the
time
when
pasquale
addressing
me
inquired
whether
i
was
certain
that
these
were
the
rooms
into
which
i
was
looking
when
i
saw
the
supposed
murderer
can
see
for
yourself
wyndham
he
remarked
your
rooms
and
mine
are
not
of
the
same
length
and
it
was
very
easy
for
you
to
make
a
mistake
by
concluding
that
the
dimensions
were
the
can
not
tell
with
any
certainty
i
added
falteringly
without
thinking
very
closely
about
it
i
had
assumed
that
the
rooms
on
both
sides
the
partition
were
the
same
depth
but
the
door
on
my
side
is
at
the
extremity
of
my
bedroom
and
when
you
said
that
the
frenchman
lived
at
the
rear
i
concluded
from
the
appearance
of
the
man
i
saw
that
i
was
looking
into
his
the
matter
can
be
settled
very
promptly
remarked
pasquale
you
will
go
with
one
of
these
gentlemen
wyndham
and
show
him
the
doorway
through
which
you
saw
the
old
man
we
can
easily
connect
with
you
this
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
to
do
and
we
prepared
to
carry
out
suggestion
as
i
was
leaving
the
room
the
police
sergeant
inquired
whether
pasquale
had
the
key
of
the
door
connecting
my
rooms
with
his
through
the
wall
dividing
the
two
houses
and
before
i
passed
out
of
hearing
i
heard
pasquale
explain
that
he
had
never
had
a
key
of
that
door
and
did
not
believe
that
there
was
one
in
existence
when
the
policeman
and
i
entered
my
apartments
the
former
remarked
that
he
thought
that
the
door
which
i
pointed
out
to
him
would
if
opened
be
found
to
lead
into
rooms
least
i
judge
so
from
the
relative
length
of
the
rooms
he
added
our
loud
knockings
at
the
door
through
which
i
had
seen
the
midnight
spectacle
produced
no
result
for
a
minute
evidently
our
friends
were
still
in
the
rear
rooms
then
we
could
hear
voices
indistinctly
and
presently
the
sound
of
blows
opposite
to
us
showed
that
our
friends
had
at
last
us
after
a
short
interval
of
heavy
blows
on
the
opposite
door
the
latter
was
burst
open
that
much
we
could
hear
by
the
volume
of
sound
which
reached
us
there
was
a
shout
of
excitement
and
presently
the
door
which
had
been
forced
was
shut
and
we
could
see
and
hear
no
more
something
very
amazing
had
happened
what
was
it
how
can
i
relate
the
story
of
the
events
which
followed
even
now
at
this
lapse
of
time
the
recital
of
them
chills
my
inmost
soul
when
we
returned
to
the
other
house
we
found
pasquale
my
friend
and
more
than
brother
in
the
custody
of
the
police
the
space
between
the
double
doors
dividing
his
room
and
mine
had
revealed
all
the
paraphernalia
of
the
supposed
murderer
and
that
it
belonged
to
pasquale
was
apparently
beyond
doubt
the
wig
and
beard
the
clothes
the
boots
the
gloves
and
even
the
with
which
the
face
had
been
painted
to
the
semblance
of
age
all
belonged
to
him
and
all
were
there
and
worse
and
still
more
damning
evidence
was
found
in
an
oblong
ivory
box
of
antique
pattern
within
this
lay
a
stiletto
handle
the
ivory
of
which
was
yellow
with
extreme
age
the
weapon
had
no
blade
but
imbedded
in
the
faded
velvet
of
the
lid
were
seven
dagger
points
identical
in
every
respect
with
those
found
in
the
heads
of
the
dead
men
as
we
came
forward
the
police
sergeant
removed
a
handkerchief
from
the
pocket
of
the
coat
found
in
the
recess
it
too
was
slightly
stained
with
blood
and
on
the
corner
it
bore
the
embroidered
monogram
of
my
friend
i
stared
at
the
face
of
pasquale
who
was
now
securely
held
by
the
police
still
the
same
puzzled
expression
in
it
that
and
nothing
more
he
was
evidently
unable
to
understand
the
situation
after
a
time
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
stretching
out
his
manacled
hands
he
took
up
the
ivory
dagger
as
if
casually
and
disinterestedly
that
must
have
been
what
he
used
he
murmured
have
read
of
such
at
that
moment
i
caught
the
gaze
of
the
valet
jacques
who
had
silently
stolen
into
the
room
i
had
up
to
this
time
hated
his
homely
reticent
face
for
the
way
it
resisted
me
but
now
and
henceforward
i
loved
it
for
the
expression
it
bore
on
that
fateful
morning
it
was
the
appeal
of
a
hero
prepared
to
sacrifice
his
life
on
the
mere
fraction
of
a
chance
and
what
his
glance
entreated
was
that
i
should
create
a
diversion
so
that
he
should
carry
out
his
intentions
the
hard
lines
on
his
inflexible
face
seemed
to
shiver
and
break
in
his
terrible
anxiety
and
his
fears
although
they
added
to
my
own
dread
inspired
me
i
said
to
the
officer
have
a
confession
to
make
this
gentleman
pointing
to
pasquale
done
nothing
a
child
could
see
by
his
face
that
he
is
innocent
i
am
the
guilty
person
my
room
also
opens
on
to
that
cupboard
i
placed
all
the
material
of
my
there
and
raised
the
alarm
to
disguise
my
own
guilt
and
i
held
out
my
wrists
as
if
to
feel
the
clasp
of
the
handcuffs
at
the
conclusion
of
my
remarks
jacques
sprang
forward
like
a
tiger
hurled
one
detective
to
the
floor
thrust
the
policemen
swiftly
on
one
side
and
seizing
his
master
by
the
arm
was
hurrying
him
away
when
a
violent
blow
from
the
powerful
and
sergeant
disabled
him
him
the
sergeant
said
briefly
to
his
subordinates
indicating
poor
jacques
then
turning
to
myself
he
pointed
with
his
hand
to
the
door
opening
into
my
room
of
which
the
bolts
were
still
shot
in
their
sockets
admire
your
efforts
sir
but
you
could
not
have
entered
that
space
between
the
two
doors
from
your
room
for
it
was
bolted
against
you
meantime
pasquale
appeared
unconscious
of
the
turmoil
he
seemed
still
to
be
examining
the
stilettos
only
once
did
he
look
up
when
he
heard
me
endeavoring
to
incriminate
myself
then
a
soft
beautiful
smile
crept
over
his
face
but
he
nevertheless
shook
his
head
with
inflexible
determination
must
accompany
me
sir
said
the
sergeant
to
pasquale
jail
inquired
the
other
pasquale
to
jail
and
he
laughed
softly
as
if
the
thought
amused
him
wyndham
dear
old
friend
faithful
to
the
last
heaven
send
you
the
best
of
luck
and
he
kissed
me
fondly
and
even
passionately
on
both
cheeks
bless
you
twice
over
once
for
yourself
and
once
for
me
who
never
had
a
blessing
and
as
he
spoke
a
tremor
shook
his
frame
and
he
was
barely
able
to
steady
himself
jacques
my
faithful
friend
and
guardian
god
bless
you
too
pray
for
then
his
gaze
grew
dim
with
tears
and
he
turned
again
to
the
strange
weapon
still
lying
on
the
table
would
have
thought
that
these
little
bodkins
could
have
wrought
such
fearful
havoc
as
he
spoke
he
took
up
one
of
the
steel
points
and
fitted
it
mechanically
into
its
socket
it
was
all
over
in
a
moment
with
a
rapid
movement
pasquale
directed
the
point
towards
himself
his
wrist
turned
slightly
the
hand
tightened
fiercely
and
then
opened
and
the
ivory
handle
of
the
stiletto
rolled
on
the
floor
as
pasquale
reeled
and
fell
into
the
arms
of
those
behind
him
his
eyes
opened
wide
smiled
the
old
smile
into
mine
just
for
one
brief
instant
then
the
darkness
of
death
blotted
out
their
light
and
the
lids
drooped
slowly
as
if
from
overwhelming
fatigue
pasquale
had
entered
into
the
rest
which
knows
no
waking
they
thought
that
he
had
fainted
but
i
knew
differently
the
deadly
stiletto
had
done
its
last
work
faithfully
and
fatally
the
quick
turn
of
the
wrist
and
the
fierce
grasp
of
the
weapon
had
released
the
powerful
spring
concealed
in
the
ivory
handle
and
the
dagger
point
was
now
imbedded
in
heart
a
week
later
two
visitors
entered
my
rooms
they
were
my
dead
father
and
the
valet
jacques
from
the
former
i
learned
that
his
son
had
for
some
years
been
subject
to
fits
of
dementia
these
usually
occurred
during
the
full
moon
reason
for
sending
his
son
to
london
was
a
hope
expressed
by
the
family
doctor
that
an
entire
change
of
scene
might
strengthen
his
mind
and
his
body
and
be
the
means
of
creating
a
break
in
those
periodic
attacks
jacques
the
valet
was
in
reality
a
faithful
servant
of
the
family
employed
from
the
first
to
take
care
of
his
young
master
he
had
occupied
the
adjoining
room
with
pasquale
from
the
date
of
his
first
arrival
but
he
kept
himself
very
much
in
the
background
as
pasquale
was
extremely
sensitive
lest
his
condition
should
become
known
a
fact
which
explained
his
to
me
unaccountable
objection
to
receiving
me
in
his
rooms
after
the
return
from
paris
jacques
as
the
reader
is
aware
took
a
more
prominent
part
in
his
daily
life
for
it
was
then
that
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
this
greater
prominence
was
due
to
the
fact
that
jacques
had
reported
to
amidio
pasquale
senior
that
the
attacks
instead
of
becoming
more
feeble
were
growing
more
marked
month
by
month
jacques
explained
that
the
sudden
alleged
departure
of
his
young
master
was
due
to
the
fact
that
feeling
the
approach
of
the
mental
disorder
he
would
without
delay
place
himself
in
his
hands
he
was
in
nowise
a
prisoner
for
from
the
first
to
the
last
there
had
not
been
on
the
part
either
of
his
family
or
of
his
valet
the
faintest
suspicion
of
a
homicidal
mania
the
only
objects
of
the
secrecy
being
a
general
watchfulness
in
case
of
fresh
developments
and
to
keep
his
infirmity
from
the
knowledge
of
his
friends
there
were
days
when
pasquale
felt
out
of
sorts
and
indisposed
and
since
it
was
the
orders
of
his
medical
man
that
he
should
be
soothed
and
not
opposed
at
such
periods
the
valet
made
no
intrusion
on
his
privacy
then
it
was
undoubtedly
at
such
periods
that
my
most
serious
attacks
had
culminated
in
the
atrocities
already
recorded
for
of
his
connection
with
these
subsequent
investigations
removed
every
shadow
of
doubt
as
for
the
apparent
difficulty
in
crossing
the
channel
to
england
and
committing
a
murder
without
his
absence
being
discovered
by
his
friends
that
was
readily
explained
he
had
never
while
in
paris
been
under
strict
surveillance
and
he
was
frequently
absent
for
a
few
days
at
a
time
at
a
house
it
was
evident
that
plans
conceived
during
one
period
of
lunacy
were
perfected
during
the
next
or
following
periods
this
was
especially
evident
in
connection
with
the
dead
efforts
to
obtain
specimens
of
the
of
the
men
whom
he
had
resolved
to
kill
and
had
afterwards
killed
in
the
closet
where
the
disguise
was
found
in
which
i
had
seen
my
friend
arrayed
in
that
awful
midnight
glance
were
discovered
letters
from
six
justices
of
the
peace
five
of
whom
including
the
chief
of
the
police
had
undoubtedly
died
by
hand
these
letters
were
evidently
in
reply
to
cunningly
worded
inquiries
such
as
would
be
likely
to
induce
the
recipients
to
answer
with
their
own
hands
this
had
been
done
in
every
case
but
one
the
sixth
letter
had
been
dictated
and
the
lengthy
epistles
which
the
unsuspecting
justices
had
written
afforded
pasquale
then
in
the
fulness
of
his
madness
ample
opportunity
of
making
himself
acquainted
with
their
handwritings
and
so
enabled
him
to
forge
the
farewell
letters
by
each
supposed
suicide
without
fear
of
detection
if
further
proof
of
my
demented
guilt
had
been
wanted
it
was
readily
forthcoming
in
the
drafts
of
the
letters
to
the
justices
found
in
his
handwriting
in
the
same
recess
the
horrible
feeling
akin
to
remorse
which
i
experienced
on
recognizing
that
it
was
my
evidence
as
to
the
aged
figure
which
i
had
seen
at
midnight
in
the
adjoining
room
that
had
resulted
in
my
arrest
and
suicide
was
somewhat
mitigated
when
i
learned
that
on
the
morning
of
the
discovery
the
superintendent
of
police
at
scotland
yard
had
received
by
the
first
post
a
communication
from
the
expert
employed
by
my
dead
friend
to
examine
the
letters
left
by
the
supposed
suicides
to
the
effect
that
having
detected
a
certain
resemblance
in
the
handwriting
in
letter
to
that
in
the
forgeries
he
had
made
a
crucial
examination
with
the
result
of
satisfying
himself
that
the
two
were
identical
on
the
strength
of
that
evidence
a
warrant
would
have
been
obtained
against
pasquale
that
day
had
not
events
rendered
it
unnecessary
nor
was
that
all
on
the
desk
i
saw
the
five
letters
which
had
elicited
the
replies
found
in
the
recess
these
a
keen
detective
had
discovered
among
the
papers
of
the
dead
man
when
in
search
of
some
trace
as
to
the
methods
employed
to
obtain
specimens
of
their
handwriting
these
letters
requested
a
reply
to
amidio
pasquale
o
box
no
presumably
to
avoid
their
delivery
at
the
house
at
unseasonable
times
and
indicating
that
pasquale
mad
was
on
his
guard
against
pasquale
sane
so
that
on
all
sides
the
net
had
been
closing
in
around
my
dear
demented
friend
why
then
did
fate
so
gratuitously
add
to
my
lot
the
painful
reflection
that
i
had
by
my
discovery
precipitated
my
death
these
additional
links
proved
how
boundless
the
resources
of
destiny
are
when
her
time
has
arrived
surely
then
she
might
have
spared
me
that
last
bitter
drop
which
she
had
added
to
my
brimming
cup
my
task
is
done
with
tragic
ending
a
shadow
settled
upon
me
and
it
has
never
wholly
lifted
our
friendship
lives
in
my
memory
as
the
one
green
and
sunny
oasis
in
my
desert
life
and
here
far
away
from
the
home
of
my
youth
i
sit
and
muse
on
the
gladsome
hours
we
spent
together
my
only
grounds
for
belief
that
there
is
a
happier
world
beyond
the
man
i
knew
the
friend
i
loved
so
passionately
the
creature
to
whom
the
pain
of
any
creature
which
god
had
made
was
torture
was
unconscious
of
the
acts
and
ignorant
of
the
identity
of
pasquale
the
insane
murderer
that
much
wise
physicians
versed
in
the
mysteries
of
the
human
brain
have
told
me
and
that
i
at
least
never
for
an
instant
doubted
it
may
be
that
disorder
was
mentally
contagious
and
that
my
open
and
receptive
mind
imbibed
some
of
the
fatal
theories
which
at
times
overbalanced
his
brilliant
intellect
i
almost
hope
that
it
is
so
for
it
will
extenuate
the
wicked
rebellious
thoughts
which
still
surge
through
my
brain
when
i
recall
the
steps
one
by
one
which
led
to
the
final
ending
the
thought
of
the
loving
and
gentle
pasquale
fierce
only
in
the
pursuit
of
wrong
bringing
all
the
marvelous
resources
of
his
wonderful
brain
to
the
discovery
of
that
terrible
london
mystery
and
unraveling
it
thread
by
thread
only
to
weave
it
anew
into
a
noose
for
himself
paralyzes
my
brain
did
ever
human
being
before
lead
justice
step
by
step
through
such
a
labyrinth
of
crime
and
so
unweariedly
until
he
brought
her
to
the
very
threshold
of
murder
and
face
to
face
with
himself
the
unconscious
murderer
i
left
my
rooms
hastily
and
in
disorder
as
if
invaded
by
the
plague
once
only
i
unintentionally
passed
the
house
and
through
the
doorway
of
my
cab
i
saw
the
dull
dusty
windows
of
an
empty
residence
with
the
legend
be
placarded
on
the
no
the
lost
chapter
i
you
think
it
unlucky
then
to
take
off
the
inquiry
sprang
with
a
air
of
surprise
and
alarm
from
a
pair
of
pretty
lips
and
still
more
eagerly
from
two
and
expressive
gray
eyes
dear
very
unlucky
you
ought
to
leave
it
where
your
husband
placed
it
it
is
like
undoing
the
ceremony
to
take
it
this
most
depressing
reply
was
made
with
an
air
of
conviction
which
greatly
disturbed
the
fair
questioner
the
bride
of
a
month
who
had
in
a
childish
fit
of
restlessness
removed
her
and
was
engaged
testing
the
stupendousness
of
its
avoirdupois
on
the
coral
tips
of
her
dainty
fingers
slowly
and
as
if
it
were
something
uncanny
the
truant
hoop
was
slipped
back
to
its
place
as
the
delicate
flush
on
the
young
cheek
deepened
with
the
dawning
consciousness
of
a
hitherto
unknown
crime
wish
you
would
tell
me
why
you
think
so
grandma
was
the
somewhat
timid
rejoinder
the
elder
busy
hands
had
dropped
on
her
knees
and
her
face
wore
the
expression
which
told
that
eyes
were
with
her
heart
and
that
was
far
the
question
was
evidently
unheard
and
it
was
presently
amended
dear
has
your
never
been
off
your
finger
since
grandpa
placed
it
there
the
second
question
recalled
the
old
wandering
thoughts
and
she
replied
with
a
falter
in
her
voice
which
heightened
the
look
of
alarm
on
her
face
dear
did
anything
happen
love
something
which
i
will
never
forget
as
long
as
i
as
the
elder
lady
spoke
the
color
faded
slowly
from
the
cheeks
of
the
youthful
bride
leaving
the
glowing
eyes
doubly
dark
by
contrast
with
their
pallor
you
think
that
it
is
growing
cold
grandma
this
was
said
with
a
little
shiver
and
looking
up
the
latter
recognized
for
the
first
time
that
her
remarks
had
startled
and
alarmed
her
you
alice
she
added
hastily
do
not
mean
to
say
that
misfortune
follows
for
of
course
a
very
great
many
people
take
off
their
sooner
or
later
apparently
without
any
serious
consequences
and
i
think
that
anything
really
threatens
the
happiness
of
a
married
couple
unless
the
ring
is
actually
lost
still
my
dear
the
sound
of
a
rapid
manly
tread
advancing
on
the
arbor
where
the
two
were
seated
caused
the
bride
to
spring
to
her
feet
with
a
glad
cry
for
a
moment
the
husband
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
pair
of
swimming
gray
eyes
with
a
world
of
woe
reflected
in
their
shadowy
depths
the
next
a
trembling
pliant
figure
was
nestling
in
his
arms
and
trying
to
explain
amid
tearful
sobs
about
the
bad
luck
coming
to
them
both
through
the
removal
of
the
as
soon
as
the
astonished
husband
could
frame
an
intelligible
meaning
out
of
the
story
told
with
many
interruptions
of
sobs
and
kisses
and
passionate
hugs
he
burst
into
a
merry
laugh
you
little
silly
he
began
but
his
voice
melted
to
a
tenderness
inarticulate
in
words
although
mutually
intelligible
in
rich
vocabulary
to
think
what
a
sweet
little
goose
it
is
after
all
commenced
the
husband
after
exactions
had
been
religiously
complied
with
i
know
ladies
who
are
continually
losing
their
there
is
north
for
instance
george
resumed
the
husband
a
little
confusedly
know
of
course
that
she
and
her
husband
do
not
get
on
very
well
together
but
there
are
others
there
is
let
me
see
but
never
mind
tell
you
what
do
i
will
take
the
ring
off
your
finger
myself
and
put
it
on
again
that
will
make
everything
just
as
it
was
and
with
this
pleasing
little
sophistry
both
bride
and
groom
were
made
happy
once
more
as
the
youthful
pair
left
the
arbor
the
old
lady
whose
loving
heart
was
wont
to
grow
young
again
as
she
contemplated
the
happiness
of
the
others
softly
rubbed
the
mists
from
her
glasses
as
she
said
with
a
sigh
i
wish
alice
had
not
taken
off
her
chapter
ii
that
the
shadows
of
anxiety
had
not
been
altogether
dispelled
from
the
breast
of
the
young
bride
alice
montgomery
was
rendered
apparent
to
her
grandmamma
the
following
morning
when
the
exactions
of
business
had
emptied
the
house
of
its
male
population
the
two
ladies
were
seated
on
a
broad
piazza
whose
columns
and
roof
were
richly
festooned
with
a
wealth
of
luxuriant
creeper
which
the
gentle
breeze
creeping
up
from
the
meadows
and
laden
with
the
smell
of
the
just
stirred
and
no
more
for
awhile
the
two
sat
in
silence
their
busy
fingers
and
the
placid
movement
of
their
keeping
up
a
kind
of
rhythmical
flow
of
action
as
soothing
as
the
of
the
tidal
ebb
and
flow
on
a
pebbly
shore
said
alice
somewhat
suddenly
letting
her
work
fall
on
her
lap
get
out
of
my
head
what
you
said
about
the
in
removing
george
says
that
it
is
all
an
old
superstition
and
one
quite
exploded
now
but
when
he
leaves
me
to
myself
i
get
quite
frightened
about
it
so
if
you
mind
dear
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
just
what
happened
after
you
took
off
your
dearest
i
wish
you
would
forget
all
about
it
your
husband
is
quite
right
it
is
just
an
old
but
alice
was
not
to
be
turned
from
her
inquiry
and
with
gentle
feminine
persistency
she
shook
her
pretty
head
implying
that
life
would
be
a
burden
to
her
until
this
terrible
affair
was
cleared
up
grannie
was
the
extent
of
her
audible
entreaty
but
her
eyes
contained
a
fervor
of
appeal
which
was
entirely
irresistible
and
the
old
lady
who
had
by
long
experience
learned
the
wisdom
of
an
early
capitulation
to
the
gray
eyes
as
she
called
her
grandchild
surrendered
with
a
sigh
of
protest
as
she
removed
her
spectacles
from
her
face
she
became
aware
of
a
strangely
intent
look
suddenly
visible
on
the
face
of
her
who
was
looking
at
a
clump
of
trees
in
the
distance
do
you
see
dear
she
inquired
saw
a
figure
in
the
copse
yonder
which
i
fancied
i
recognized
but
i
must
have
been
mistaken
and
the
person
whoever
he
was
has
gone
away
he
looking
this
way
grandma
and
i
imagined
for
a
moment
that
he
was
beckoning
to
me
but
of
course
that
could
not
you
know
darling
exclaimed
the
elder
lady
in
a
tone
of
concern
must
really
not
be
so
nervous
you
will
be
fancying
all
kinds
of
things
if
you
give
way
to
such
hallucinations
i
am
afraid
that
trouble
of
your
has
affected
your
health
george
must
take
you
for
a
change
of
the
heightened
color
on
the
face
of
the
youthful
bride
which
had
aroused
the
anxiety
slowly
faded
from
her
face
leaving
it
pale
and
wan
by
way
of
reply
alice
stole
to
her
side
and
brushing
away
the
silvery
hair
with
which
the
rising
breeze
was
playing
imprinted
a
loving
kiss
on
the
brow
mind
my
fads
dear
tell
me
your
story
she
whispered
in
the
ear
but
there
was
a
wistfulness
in
the
tone
which
impressed
her
aged
relation
painfully
and
she
murmured
as
the
other
sank
to
her
seat
wish
you
would
not
insist
indeed
i
do
grandma
promptly
replied
the
other
i
married
your
grandpa
dear
began
the
old
lady
i
was
in
delicate
health
my
mother
had
only
recently
died
and
the
fever
to
which
she
had
succumbed
had
wasted
my
strength
also
what
with
the
weakness
resulting
from
my
illness
and
grief
at
the
death
of
my
mother
who
had
been
my
only
remaining
relative
and
to
whom
i
was
naturally
passionately
attached
my
health
was
completely
broken
down
and
it
was
only
the
urgent
wishes
of
your
grandpapa
to
whom
i
had
been
engaged
to
be
married
for
more
than
a
year
that
i
consented
to
the
ceremony
at
such
a
time
i
felt
that
i
must
have
change
of
air
and
quickly
too
to
avoid
a
complete
collapse
and
alone
in
the
world
as
i
was
i
could
not
bear
to
go
away
and
leave
behind
me
the
only
being
that
i
loved
and
that
loved
me
too
me
sair
as
the
old
scottish
ballad
says
and
told
me
that
he
could
readily
make
arrangements
for
a
six
leave
of
absence
so
that
we
could
spend
the
which
were
approaching
in
the
south
the
wedding
we
sailed
for
florida
which
was
at
that
time
enduring
one
of
its
occasional
but
bursts
of
prosperity
in
the
old
days
long
before
the
war
the
state
was
making
money
and
the
florida
planter
as
a
potentate
ranked
side
by
side
with
the
wealthy
of
mississippi
and
louisiana
friend
of
my
family
had
a
plantation
on
the
gulf
coast
of
florida
below
cedar
keys
we
had
received
a
pressing
invitation
to
spend
our
honeymoon
on
that
plantation
and
there
we
finally
arrived
early
in
the
month
of
december
after
a
most
delightful
voyage
cedar
keys
we
had
changed
our
ship
for
a
smaller
coasting
vessel
and
as
we
sailed
in
our
new
craft
up
the
waters
of
the
homosassa
river
i
thought
that
not
even
in
my
dreams
had
i
pictured
world
so
the
broad
swelling
bosom
of
the
river
the
luminous
transparency
of
the
atmosphere
the
banks
covered
with
a
wealth
and
majesty
of
tropical
trees
and
the
numerous
coral
islands
dotting
the
centre
of
the
river
and
crowned
with
a
perfect
glory
of
foliage
all
these
thrilled
my
soul
with
a
sense
almost
of
religious
devotion
just
as
some
rare
anthem
pealing
from
some
organ
will
move
the
soul
to
an
ecstasy
of
religious
feeling
planter
and
his
family
gave
us
a
hearty
welcome
when
at
length
our
vessel
cast
anchor
off
the
plantation
landing
house
was
a
large
rambling
frame
building
with
the
negro
quarters
situated
at
some
distance
in
the
rear
and
hidden
from
view
by
a
heavy
belt
of
orange
and
banana
trees
land
was
what
is
termed
hammock
land
which
is
considered
to
possess
the
richest
soil
in
florida
the
seminole
indians
of
which
there
were
several
thousand
still
left
in
the
state
always
lived
in
the
hammocks
and
the
plantation
had
formerly
been
the
home
of
the
celebrated
chief
osceola
of
whom
you
have
read
so
much
andrews
who
owned
the
plantation
had
always
been
on
excellent
terms
with
the
indians
and
among
his
frequent
visitors
was
tallahassee
the
hereditary
grand
mico
of
the
seminoles
the
brave
and
handsome
young
of
the
tribe
after
we
arrived
at
the
plantation
tallahassee
made
one
of
his
customary
visits
bringing
with
him
an
old
warrior
of
his
tribe
and
three
younger
chiefs
andrews
had
allowed
the
seminoles
to
build
a
few
wigwams
in
an
old
hammock
near
his
house
and
in
these
the
indians
lived
during
their
visits
host
was
a
widower
with
two
sons
and
his
house
was
managed
by
the
usual
retinue
of
colored
servants
there
was
no
white
woman
about
the
place
and
i
was
probably
one
of
the
first
of
that
color
which
the
celebrated
chief
had
ever
seen
although
grave
and
silent
like
the
rest
of
his
race
and
dignified
as
became
the
supreme
authority
in
a
still
powerful
tribe
manifested
considerable
interest
in
our
excursions
and
as
he
knew
every
foot
of
the
vast
forests
and
every
on
the
great
rivers
which
were
close
at
hand
his
unobtrusive
presence
was
always
very
welcome
a
warm
friendship
though
for
the
most
part
undemonstrative
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
grew
up
between
us
and
my
husband
was
wont
to
declare
with
much
quiet
amusement
that
i
had
made
a
great
conquest
and
that
the
renowned
tallahassee
was
in
love
with
me
course
that
was
only
his
silly
nonsense
and
the
expressive
glances
of
the
dark
eyes
were
only
the
result
of
a
certain
taciturnity
of
habit
enforced
by
the
danger
of
talking
when
it
might
be
that
concealed
enemies
were
near
with
the
indians
the
eyes
are
wont
to
conduct
the
necessary
conversation
more
readily
than
the
slower
and
more
dangerous
tongue
one
occasion
the
indian
chief
our
host
my
husband
and
myself
started
in
a
boat
to
examine
the
marvelous
source
of
the
homosassa
river
a
few
miles
distant
wonderful
river
springs
a
flood
from
the
ground
and
is
already
a
hundred
yards
in
width
within
that
distance
of
its
spring
and
so
deep
as
to
be
navigable
to
craft
our
boat
entered
the
cove
where
the
river
took
its
origin
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
fearful
awe
that
i
experienced
the
sensation
of
floating
between
heaven
and
earth
above
us
was
the
pure
ether
walled
in
on
three
sides
by
giant
palms
beneath
us
lay
a
stupendous
well
of
water
clear
as
the
atmosphere
above
us
and
calm
and
silent
as
the
grave
down
in
its
transparent
depths
we
could
distinctly
see
every
tint
and
every
movement
of
the
smallest
fish
just
as
clearly
in
fact
as
we
could
see
the
movement
and
brilliant
hues
of
the
birds
and
insects
flitting
to
and
fro
between
the
trees
overhead
me
unaccustomed
to
such
wonders
the
scene
verged
on
the
supernatural
and
i
felt
as
if
there
was
something
uncanny
in
it
a
feeling
destined
soon
to
be
intensified
a
in
order
to
illustrate
the
transparency
of
the
water
which
was
there
some
forty
feet
in
depth
to
the
peddled
bottom
my
husband
threw
some
small
silver
coins
one
after
another
into
the
spring
in
which
contrary
to
expectation
there
were
no
air
bubbles
to
distract
the
view
as
we
watched
them
falling
down
through
the
water
slowly
as
a
feather
falls
through
the
air
it
seemed
almost
as
if
they
would
never
reach
the
bottom
at
last
one
of
these
coins
fell
between
two
great
rocks
directly
under
us
which
the
shadow
of
our
boat
had
prevented
us
from
seeing
sooner
the
look
exclaimed
the
indian
pointing
to
the
coin
falling
and
calling
me
by
the
poetic
name
with
which
he
was
accustomed
to
designate
me
the
small
silver
piece
glanced
between
the
dark
rocks
it
seemed
to
illuminate
the
gray
blackness
in
which
their
narrow
walls
plunged
the
space
between
them
until
finally
the
shadow
hid
it
while
still
falling
from
sight
heavens
i
exclaimed
shudderingly
deep
is
the
water
between
those
rocks
who
knows
replied
my
husband
a
while
a
spell
of
silence
fell
upon
us
as
we
lay
in
the
welcome
shadow
of
the
fringed
palms
so
deliciously
cool
after
the
heat
of
the
exposed
river
at
once
the
accident
you
wish
to
hear
about
happened
in
order
to
cool
my
fevered
hands
i
had
been
trailing
my
fingers
to
and
fro
through
the
cold
spring
water
of
the
well
the
downward
position
of
my
fingers
and
the
shrinking
of
the
flesh
in
the
cold
water
consummated
the
catastrophe
and
as
i
straightened
my
fingers
to
point
to
a
strange
variety
of
fish
my
already
somewhat
large
for
my
hand
emaciated
by
long
sickness
slipped
from
my
finger
and
slid
into
the
water
beneath
us
scream
which
burst
from
my
lips
directed
my
companions
to
the
accident
and
throwing
off
his
hat
and
shoes
my
husband
plunged
headlong
after
the
fallen
ring
indian
had
risen
hastily
to
his
feet
in
the
attempt
to
prevent
my
husband
but
before
he
could
get
past
me
in
the
frail
boat
it
was
too
late
husband
was
as
visible
to
us
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
air
above
instead
of
the
water
underneath
i
knew
him
to
be
a
strong
swimmer
so
although
his
plunge
had
somewhat
unnerved
me
i
did
not
feel
alarmed
for
his
safety
a
time
it
took
him
to
get
to
the
bottom
it
seemed
as
if
struggle
as
he
might
he
would
never
reach
it
the
fact
is
the
powerful
though
unseen
current
of
the
giant
spring
was
pressing
him
upwards
with
an
almost
irresistible
force
last
grasping
with
one
firm
hand
the
point
of
a
rock
in
order
to
enable
him
to
retain
his
position
he
stooped
to
seize
the
ring
but
it
had
fallen
between
two
pieces
of
broken
coral
and
for
a
while
which
seemed
long
to
us
but
which
was
probably
five
or
six
seconds
it
evaded
his
grasp
at
last
his
fingers
closed
upon
it
and
he
was
about
to
turn
in
order
to
ascend
to
the
surface
when
a
hoarse
cry
from
the
indian
caused
us
to
follow
the
direction
of
his
pointed
hand
alice
child
to
this
day
it
chills
my
soul
to
tell
you
what
i
saw
there
from
those
ghostly
rocks
i
told
you
of
a
gigantic
alligator
had
floated
up
like
some
horrible
creature
from
the
nether
world
and
i
could
see
the
lurid
fire
of
its
red
eyes
and
the
gleam
of
its
wide
open
jaws
as
with
a
mighty
swish
of
its
great
tail
it
rushed
at
my
husband
its
great
body
shrouding
him
from
view
as
with
a
gruesome
mantle
saw
tallahassee
knife
in
hand
and
with
his
long
and
hitherto
pliant
hair
bristling
like
a
mane
spring
headlong
from
the
boat
and
i
felt
the
frail
craft
rock
beneath
me
from
the
shock
and
then
i
think
i
must
have
become
unconscious
for
a
few
seconds
my
senses
returned
and
i
opened
my
eyes
i
saw
colonel
andrews
staring
rifle
in
hand
and
with
horrified
helpless
gaze
into
the
waters
which
were
now
red
with
blood
and
boiling
with
some
awful
invisible
conflict
what
in
great
name
was
going
on
in
the
now
hidden
depths
i
felt
as
if
my
brain
was
giving
way
and
in
my
frenzy
i
strove
to
throw
myself
into
the
water
to
die
with
my
dear
husband
if
i
could
not
save
him
with
gentle
but
firm
hand
colonel
andrews
restrained
me
that
and
if
you
see
anything
he
exclaimed
giving
me
his
rifle
am
going
to
help
my
before
he
had
finished
speaking
the
violent
lashing
of
the
waters
ceased
and
almost
instantly
the
dark
head
of
the
indian
appeared
above
the
crimsoned
waters
ah
no
god
be
praised
not
alone
across
his
shoulder
lay
the
and
insensible
body
of
my
dear
husband
whom
he
had
snatched
from
the
jaws
of
death
and
worse
than
death
and
child
from
that
instant
i
have
loved
the
whole
indian
race
a
few
vigorous
strokes
the
indian
reached
the
shore
where
he
gently
deposited
the
insensible
form
of
my
husband
after
a
lapse
of
time
which
seemed
an
eternity
to
me
the
efforts
of
tallahassee
and
colonel
andrews
were
successful
and
my
poor
husband
began
to
breathe
once
more
with
ready
knife
the
indian
cut
the
shirt
sleeve
from
his
right
arm
and
shoulder
which
were
terribly
torn
and
disfigured
by
the
cruel
teeth
the
was
fractured
and
the
arm
broken
by
the
bite
my
eyes
opened
and
rested
on
my
face
a
faint
wan
smile
crept
over
his
features
he
was
unable
to
articulate
but
his
eyes
glanced
expressively
towards
his
right
arm
i
thought
he
was
indicating
his
injury
and
showed
my
distress
but
he
gently
shook
his
head
and
whispered
faintly
could
not
move
his
wounded
arm
but
i
took
his
rigidly
clenched
hand
in
mine
and
gently
strove
to
open
it
but
the
fingers
were
set
in
their
grasp
and
i
was
afraid
to
use
any
force
a
look
of
disappointment
crept
over
his
face
and
he
murmured
weakly
did
so
and
oh
child
what
do
you
think
i
saw
there
embedded
in
his
palm
with
the
fury
of
his
grasp
when
he
found
death
setting
in
was
my
poor
come
back
from
the
depths
to
me
feelings
overwhelmed
me
and
i
sobbed
my
life
out
on
my
breast
huge
alligator
had
seized
my
husband
by
the
arm
and
in
spite
of
his
efforts
had
dragged
him
to
the
edge
of
the
deep
cleft
in
another
instant
rescue
would
have
been
hopeless
but
in
that
instant
the
knife
had
been
driven
up
to
the
hilt
in
the
eyes
of
the
great
saurian
with
rapidity
the
blows
blinded
the
alligator
and
the
pain
caused
him
to
loosen
his
hold
his
frantic
struggles
were
the
result
of
the
continued
contest
with
the
indian
my
husband
became
insensible
from
long
submersion
by
the
time
he
was
released
from
the
when
the
elder
lady
finished
her
tragic
story
the
younger
one
crept
softly
to
her
side
and
the
tears
stole
down
her
cheeks
as
she
buried
her
face
on
the
shoulder
murmuring
poor
poor
grannie
what
a
terrible
ordeal
it
must
have
been
to
go
after
the
acute
feelings
naturally
called
up
by
the
narration
of
so
painful
an
incident
had
subsided
the
young
wife
inquired
why
she
had
never
been
told
of
the
terrible
affair
before
dear
i
have
shuddered
even
to
think
of
the
thing
it
left
such
a
horrible
impression
on
my
grannie
murmured
the
other
sympathetically
if
one
tenth
of
the
misery
which
you
endured
happens
to
me
through
the
removal
of
ring
i
know
i
shall
die
i
could
never
stand
any
great
strain
people
were
stronger
then
than
they
are
now
wonder
grannie
what
you
were
like
when
you
were
my
age
resumed
the
speaker
you
no
old
miniatures
among
your
collections
of
relics
my
dear
but
i
have
an
old
which
contains
a
drawing
of
myself
sketched
during
my
honeymoon
by
my
husband
who
was
quite
a
famous
etcher
before
that
accident
to
his
arm
there
is
also
i
think
an
etching
of
tallahassee
and
one
of
the
old
very
naturally
nothing
would
content
the
youthful
bride
until
she
had
seen
the
drawings
and
her
grandmamma
left
the
piazza
to
fetch
the
album
when
left
alone
an
anxious
expression
crept
over
the
face
and
the
point
of
her
tiny
boot
tapped
the
boarded
floor
nervously
and
somewhat
impatiently
wonder
if
that
tom
whom
i
saw
beckoning
to
me
in
the
thicket
and
if
so
what
trouble
has
he
been
getting
into
now
at
that
moment
a
low
voice
called
her
softly
by
name
and
suppressing
the
scream
of
alarm
which
rose
to
her
lips
she
turned
to
find
the
person
of
whom
she
was
thinking
her
scapegrace
brother
tom
half
hidden
in
the
shrubbery
which
separated
the
main
building
from
some
outhouses
before
she
could
frame
any
greeting
a
letter
fluttered
to
her
feet
and
the
alarming
visitor
disappeared
as
her
grandmamma
returned
album
in
hand
all
that
the
letter
said
when
surreptitiously
opened
was
meet
you
at
the
end
of
the
peach
walk
at
eight
fail
to
be
there
my
safety
meantime
with
spectacles
adjusted
the
old
lady
with
gentle
fingers
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
antiquated
album
now
yellowed
with
its
half
century
of
age
alice
she
at
last
exclaimed
is
my
likeness
and
really
dear
it
is
as
like
you
as
it
can
be
or
else
my
old
eyes
are
deceiving
grannie
it
a
beauty
like
me
is
it
ah
you
are
flattering
me
and
yet
really
truly
i
almost
seem
to
be
gazing
at
myself
when
i
look
at
it
i
hope
dearest
i
shall
be
as
beautiful
as
you
are
when
i
am
old
but
i
think
only
a
good
life
can
make
a
handsome
old
by
way
of
reply
the
other
stroked
the
beautiful
dark
brown
hair
which
frowned
over
the
fair
grecian
features
and
murmured
will
be
beautiful
my
darling
god
has
given
you
not
only
a
beautiful
face
but
a
beautiful
and
unselfish
disposition
to
match
grandma
is
that
indian
tallahassee
inquired
alice
pointing
to
a
etching
of
an
indian
chief
evidently
of
the
seminole
tribe
from
the
turbaned
head
and
locks
dear
that
is
our
noble
friend
long
the
young
eyes
gazed
on
the
spirited
etching
which
revealed
an
indian
warrior
or
buck
in
his
youthful
prime
his
luminous
eyes
and
handsome
aquiline
features
dignified
with
all
the
seminole
pride
of
race
but
wearing
as
well
a
certain
refinement
of
expression
rarely
seen
except
in
very
highly
civilized
society
but
it
is
very
doubtful
if
the
young
attention
was
riveted
on
the
likeness
for
when
she
raised
her
head
there
was
an
air
of
troubled
perplexity
visible
on
her
face
which
the
inspection
of
the
portrait
could
not
account
for
was
she
thinking
of
her
brother
you
must
have
suffered
grannie
i
wonder
you
could
ever
bear
to
hear
the
name
of
florida
dear
i
have
none
of
that
feeling
some
of
the
happiest
moments
of
my
life
were
spent
there
and
i
am
hopeful
that
i
may
visit
it
once
again
now
that
it
is
so
easy
of
access
wonder
whether
our
old
friend
tallahassee
has
forgotten
us
surely
he
is
not
living
yet
exclaimed
the
in
an
astonished
voice
dear
i
believe
he
is
he
certainly
was
alive
a
year
ago
although
he
is
now
an
old
and
heartbroken
man
the
settlement
of
the
state
by
emigrants
has
driven
him
from
his
old
haunts
and
from
every
new
home
as
fast
as
he
has
made
it
and
the
tribe
has
dwindled
down
to
a
mere
handful
of
followers
and
himself
the
very
tender
mercies
of
the
pale
face
are
cruel
to
the
red
did
he
own
no
land
tribe
thought
they
owned
it
all
but
the
white
man
came
and
wrested
it
from
them
and
although
our
own
government
always
promised
to
give
tallahassee
a
reservation
of
his
own
it
was
never
done
and
now
the
old
warrior
has
not
even
land
of
his
own
sufficient
to
be
buried
a
shame
is
it
the
fault
of
the
government
think
it
is
the
fault
of
the
indian
department
i
think
the
officials
had
any
bad
intentions
towards
tallahassee
and
his
seminoles
who
have
always
been
entirely
friendly
to
the
whites
but
there
was
no
one
to
urge
the
red
claim
and
so
the
thing
drifted
from
session
to
session
while
matters
grew
worse
for
the
indians
every
year
ah
it
is
very
true
that
is
wrought
by
want
of
thought
as
well
as
want
of
wish
george
was
a
senator
i
would
get
him
to
press
poor
dear
old
claim
murmured
the
young
wife
in
half
soliloquy
for
which
little
speech
the
old
lady
kissed
her
affectionately
as
they
passed
indoors
together
chapter
iii
notwithstanding
the
outward
sense
of
joyousness
and
rest
in
the
brilliant
sun
softened
breeze
and
lovely
landscape
there
was
trouble
brewing
for
the
peaceful
new
england
home
and
one
at
least
of
its
inmates
seemed
conscious
of
the
fact
wonder
exclaimed
alice
as
she
stood
before
the
cheval
glass
in
her
attending
to
those
delicate
personal
adornments
with
which
youthful
brides
are
wont
to
prepare
to
receive
their
lords
and
masters
wonder
whether
grandma
would
have
told
me
that
terrible
story
about
her
if
she
had
known
that
i
had
really
lost
mine
this
momentous
question
was
asked
of
her
her
own
brilliant
reflection
in
the
swinging
mirror
before
her
as
the
young
bride
turned
with
a
look
of
inquiry
to
her
image
in
the
glass
we
may
be
permitted
a
passing
glance
at
the
reflection
which
met
her
gaze
a
tall
and
lissom
figure
with
all
the
graceful
lines
of
the
stately
grecian
form
combined
with
the
warmer
and
more
womanly
outlines
of
the
norman
maiden
the
youthful
matron
stood
a
vision
of
loveliness
which
praxiteles
himself
might
have
despaired
to
reproduce
as
she
tossed
the
burden
of
brown
tresses
from
her
forehead
her
pure
grecian
profile
stood
out
clear
and
delicate
as
a
cameo
against
the
curtain
of
dark
hair
which
fell
a
rippling
sombre
cascade
almost
to
her
feet
the
dark
eyes
smiled
back
a
sympathetic
glance
from
the
mirror
and
then
a
weary
sigh
of
anxiety
clouded
the
beautiful
eyes
with
trouble
why
the
conversation
about
the
removed
ring
had
been
resumed
in
the
morning
and
in
compliance
with
the
request
the
young
bride
had
again
taken
off
her
in
order
that
he
might
himself
replace
it
on
her
fair
finger
this
unfortunately
happened
on
the
upper
piazza
and
in
the
usual
loving
conflict
with
which
youthful
couples
adjust
all
matters
between
themselves
the
ring
had
fallen
into
the
garden
and
mysteriously
disappeared
search
had
been
made
high
and
low
but
unavailingly
and
with
a
feeling
of
alarm
which
each
concealed
from
the
other
but
which
nevertheless
almost
bordered
on
despair
the
subject
was
dropped
with
mutual
consent
is
just
as
well
said
the
husband
with
simulated
cheerfulness
will
bring
you
a
fresh
ring
and
i
will
put
that
on
your
finger
myself
for
pet
but
it
be
ring
the
bride
had
exclaimed
with
a
tremor
in
her
voice
and
although
the
husband
had
ridiculed
the
idea
that
it
made
any
difference
he
was
painfully
conscious
of
the
look
of
gentle
reproach
in
the
outraged
eyes
of
his
young
wife
and
of
the
justice
of
it
punctually
at
five
the
coachman
brought
around
the
carriage
in
which
his
young
mistress
was
accustomed
to
drive
to
the
station
to
meet
her
husband
the
train
arrived
punctually
but
it
brought
no
husband
to
the
waiting
wife
it
was
her
first
disappointment
trivial
in
character
though
it
might
be
and
to
the
youthful
bride
it
was
painful
almost
beyond
expression
as
the
coachman
drove
home
it
required
a
brave
effort
to
still
the
quivering
lip
and
to
press
back
the
too
ready
tear
i
hope
she
murmured
fearfully
this
is
not
the
beginning
of
any
trouble
through
the
loss
of
my
for
a
moment
the
thought
appalled
her
and
then
a
smile
of
wonderful
relief
flashed
across
her
face
how
silly
i
am
she
exclaimed
chiding
herself
course
george
is
late
because
he
has
to
buy
me
a
new
this
explanation
was
entirely
sufficient
and
the
once
more
radiant
bride
ascended
to
her
room
humming
a
dainty
little
operatic
air
as
happy
as
the
which
flooded
the
sunny
stairway
with
melody
but
the
shadow
returned
to
the
young
face
with
gloom
when
the
six
and
seven
trains
arrived
and
brought
no
husband
with
them
is
detained
on
business
dear
explained
her
grandma
he
telegraph
then
is
no
office
within
five
miles
love
and
no
doubt
he
thought
he
would
get
here
before
his
but
another
trouble
weighed
and
heavily
upon
the
young
mind
the
last
train
was
due
at
eight
the
hour
so
urgently
appointed
by
her
brother
for
their
interview
how
she
possibly
meet
both
her
husband
and
her
brother
at
the
same
time
this
brother
was
a
sad
scapegrace
and
it
had
been
the
one
mistake
of
the
married
life
not
to
mention
his
existence
to
her
husband
you
tell
your
husband
about
tom
had
urged
the
old
lady
i
bear
george
to
know
that
i
have
anybody
disgraceful
so
nearly
related
to
me
if
ever
he
misunderstood
any
of
my
actions
or
if
i
was
not
at
hand
to
explain
them
he
would
be
certain
to
think
that
i
was
going
wrong
like
poor
tom
and
it
would
break
my
heart
you
remember
dear
that
night
when
we
were
talking
about
the
wollanders
how
scornfully
he
said
they
run
straight
to
save
their
lives
it
is
in
the
blood
the
strain
is
that
sentence
of
determined
me
not
to
tell
him
me
dearest
replied
the
other
was
a
mistake
and
one
which
grows
more
serious
the
longer
it
is
kept
i
tell
him
returned
alice
with
a
little
air
of
determination
grannie
dear
scare
me
like
and
so
the
matter
had
ended
for
that
time
and
fair
opportunity
was
lost
forevermore
when
montgomery
arrived
by
the
eight
train
and
found
no
one
to
meet
him
a
dull
feeling
of
apprehension
crept
into
his
heart
his
first
thought
was
my
darling
be
sick
she
is
in
very
delicate
with
hasty
steps
he
sped
on
his
homeward
way
denouncing
the
special
business
which
on
that
particular
day
had
detained
him
glad
i
thought
to
buy
the
ring
during
the
day
and
did
not
leave
it
till
after
business
or
i
should
either
have
lost
the
last
train
or
had
to
come
home
without
the
entering
the
house
unseen
by
the
side
door
he
glanced
through
the
empty
reception
rooms
noted
the
vacant
and
then
hastened
upstairs
to
his
apartments
only
however
to
find
these
silent
and
deserted
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
and
oppression
took
possession
of
him
can
everybody
be
he
muttered
there
are
grandpa
and
grandma
coming
across
the
fields
but
where
is
alice
hastily
glancing
across
the
grounds
from
the
window
of
his
boudoir
he
caught
a
glimpse
in
the
gathering
dusk
of
feminine
apparel
at
the
end
of
the
long
peach
walk
the
light
was
too
uncertain
the
distance
too
great
and
the
foliage
too
thick
for
accurate
observation
but
it
appeared
to
him
that
some
member
of
the
household
probably
one
of
the
maids
was
keeping
a
somewhat
late
appointment
out
of
doors
for
with
the
aid
of
a
pair
of
taken
from
the
adjoining
table
he
could
discern
the
dark
outline
of
a
dress
in
close
proximity
to
the
other
and
more
flowing
garment
presently
the
two
figures
parted
and
in
the
person
of
the
female
now
hurrying
down
the
peach
walk
toward
the
house
the
astonished
husband
recognized
his
wife
for
a
moment
he
stood
gazing
stolidly
it
seemed
out
of
the
window
only
the
dull
leaden
look
creeping
over
his
face
and
presently
the
panting
breath
gave
indication
of
the
shock
he
had
received
that
his
wife
whom
he
had
considered
as
pure
as
the
angels
in
heaven
should
take
advantage
of
his
first
absence
to
meet
another
man
clandestinely
another
man
bah
an
old
lover
for
did
she
not
kiss
him
at
parting
yes
that
much
the
glasses
had
enabled
him
to
see
the
thought
was
agony
a
thousand
times
worse
than
death
alice
alice
my
love
my
wife
how
you
he
cried
to
the
unhearing
walls
as
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
with
a
gesture
of
infinite
pain
that
however
was
the
last
wail
of
weakness
then
the
frenzy
of
jealousy
and
revenge
seized
him
and
possessed
him
like
a
demon
and
the
look
on
his
face
as
he
took
a
revolver
from
a
secret
panel
in
the
bureau
boded
ill
for
his
future
happiness
the
very
first
month
of
my
marriage
too
he
muttered
and
the
words
seemed
ground
out
between
his
clenched
teeth
but
i
will
clear
this
thing
up
or
put
an
end
to
it
once
for
all
even
if
in
doing
so
i
have
to
put
an
end
his
voice
sank
as
he
passed
from
a
side
door
and
stole
rapidly
through
the
garden
to
intercept
the
man
who
had
just
left
his
wife
the
narrow
path
through
the
woods
brought
him
out
as
he
had
anticipated
in
advance
of
the
person
whom
he
had
come
to
meet
he
saw
him
coming
along
a
hundred
yards
or
so
away
and
he
felt
mixed
up
with
his
murderous
feelings
a
craving
to
see
the
face
of
the
man
for
whom
his
wife
had
forgotten
him
even
in
their
honeymoon
the
stranger
bade
him
with
an
easy
nonchalant
air
and
was
passing
on
his
way
to
the
station
commanded
the
other
in
a
hoarse
and
unnatural
tone
the
face
that
turned
towards
him
with
an
air
of
easy
surprise
was
wonderfully
handsome
and
now
that
it
recognized
an
enemy
in
the
man
before
it
as
insolent
as
handsome
are
you
inquired
montgomery
in
a
calmer
tone
of
which
the
other
possibly
failed
to
note
the
full
significance
the
answer
was
to
flick
the
ash
from
his
cigar
in
the
face
and
then
to
turn
easily
and
coolly
on
his
heel
in
an
instant
hand
was
on
his
shoulder
and
the
two
men
faced
each
other
at
bay
met
a
lady
just
now
and
you
kissed
her
on
leaving
burst
from
between
white
lips
certainly
you
know
who
she
is
you
dare
to
tell
me
that
to
my
face
and
also
to
tell
you
that
i
hope
to
meet
and
kiss
the
lady
a
great
many
more
at
least
in
this
world
again
grimly
broke
in
the
other
lashed
to
madness
by
the
insolent
smile
of
his
antagonist
and
stepping
back
a
pace
he
levelled
the
revolver
full
at
the
face
as
the
other
saw
the
gleam
of
the
barrel
he
shouted
and
threw
back
his
head
but
the
action
was
too
late
the
bullet
struck
him
in
the
temple
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
his
face
bathed
in
blood
for
a
moment
the
other
stood
motionless
with
the
smoking
weapon
in
his
hand
then
he
stooped
and
looked
in
the
face
of
the
dead
man
all
the
amazing
fury
had
died
out
of
his
heart
he
looked
towards
the
home
where
his
wife
was
awaiting
him
and
he
murmured
forgive
you
alice
you
have
made
me
a
then
there
came
to
him
as
to
all
similarly
circumstanced
the
brute
instinct
of
one
saw
me
arrive
he
muttered
to
himself
one
will
suspect
me
still
i
would
like
to
know
that
i
had
found
out
her
crime
and
punished
as
he
said
this
a
strange
ghastly
smile
weird
in
the
extreme
crept
over
his
face
and
he
laid
on
the
dead
breast
gently
not
in
tribute
to
the
man
but
in
reverence
of
death
the
which
he
had
bought
that
day
to
replace
the
missing
one
will
understand
by
this
just
how
it
happened
he
murmured
as
he
turned
to
go
once
he
looked
back
and
saw
the
dark
form
lying
on
the
lonely
road
and
so
strange
a
composite
is
humanity
he
felt
a
thrill
of
revengeful
joy
to
think
how
refined
a
method
of
punishment
he
had
discovered
for
his
wife
poor
misguided
man
how
little
he
dreamt
of
the
widespread
harm
which
that
small
gold
hoop
was
destined
to
work
chapter
iv
the
shriek
of
the
railway
whistle
recalled
george
montgomery
to
a
sense
of
his
desperate
situation
and
at
the
same
time
suggested
a
means
of
escape
the
fast
was
arriving
it
was
due
in
new
york
an
hour
later
there
was
the
barest
possibility
that
he
might
be
arrested
on
his
arrival
in
new
york
but
on
the
other
hand
the
general
ignorance
as
to
his
having
been
at
the
scene
of
the
murder
the
distance
from
the
telegraph
station
and
the
infinite
advantages
presented
by
the
great
metropolis
for
concealing
his
identity
far
the
possible
risk
and
the
fugitive
hesitatingly
entered
the
train
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
anathemized
the
long
cars
common
to
all
and
remembered
with
regret
the
narrow
and
private
carriages
which
he
had
seen
on
the
english
railroads
how
he
would
have
liked
to
bury
himself
between
their
sheltering
cushions
and
by
means
of
a
handsome
fee
to
the
guard
have
secured
the
compartment
to
himself
who
shall
describe
what
the
murderer
feels
during
the
first
hour
of
his
criminal
life
when
the
crime
has
been
unpremeditated
and
there
has
been
no
previous
process
of
hardening
up
an
hour
ago
this
man
was
one
who
rightly
claimed
the
respect
of
all
his
and
had
his
claim
abundantly
allowed
he
had
fallen
sheer
and
at
a
single
plunge
through
whole
strata
of
respectability
to
find
himself
jarred
and
stupefied
by
the
fall
on
the
of
crime
below
which
nothing
human
goes
he
picked
up
a
paper
lying
in
the
adjoining
seat
and
his
eye
caught
the
heading
of
a
flagrant
defalcation
unearthed
that
day
two
hours
previous
he
had
read
the
same
news
and
had
felt
only
contempt
for
the
miserable
delinquent
the
mere
swindler
seemed
as
far
removed
from
him
in
the
category
of
crime
as
lazarus
in
heaven
seemed
removed
from
dives
in
torment
as
the
train
sped
on
the
remembrance
of
his
infidelity
finally
drove
all
thought
of
his
crime
from
his
mind
as
memory
ruthless
and
unsparing
pictured
to
his
gaze
all
that
they
had
been
to
each
other
and
recalled
every
incident
of
their
courtship
and
marriage
when
he
had
so
blindly
and
foolishly
thought
that
they
were
all
the
world
to
each
other
the
limits
of
the
carriage
in
which
he
traveled
seemed
impossible
to
hold
him
and
the
old
lust
of
murder
crept
up
on
his
brain
like
a
returning
springtide
when
the
fresh
paroxysm
had
spent
itself
the
train
entered
new
york
within
twenty
minutes
a
carriage
stopped
at
a
certain
number
in
nassau
street
and
the
fugitive
with
the
aid
of
his
private
key
entered
his
office
as
he
did
so
the
janitor
handed
him
some
letters
which
had
arrived
since
he
had
left
these
he
carelessly
cast
aside
reserving
one
the
handwriting
of
which
seemed
familiar
this
he
laid
on
one
side
there
was
no
lack
of
decision
in
george
actions
first
of
all
he
wrote
a
letter
to
his
partner
saying
that
circumstances
beyond
his
control
compelled
his
temporary
absence
and
requesting
that
until
further
advised
a
certain
sum
be
paid
monthly
to
his
wife
he
also
intimated
that
he
had
taken
with
him
a
copy
of
the
telegraphic
code
which
he
would
use
if
necessary
after
concluding
such
arrangements
as
he
deemed
advisable
for
the
proper
conduct
of
the
business
during
his
absence
he
withdrew
from
the
safe
a
considerable
sum
of
money
substituting
his
check
on
a
leading
bank
for
the
same
then
after
ringing
for
a
messenger
boy
he
ran
his
fingers
through
his
and
having
consulted
the
shipping
list
to
see
as
to
the
outgoing
vessels
a
sudden
inspiration
seemed
to
seize
him
and
he
ordered
a
cab
and
drove
to
the
private
residence
of
isamord
hadley
principal
owner
of
the
new
york
spanish
steamship
company
tide
serves
at
he
muttered
as
he
took
his
seat
in
a
cab
i
believe
spain
has
no
extradition
treaty
with
this
country
and
if
she
has
no
american
detective
could
find
me
there
so
long
as
i
have
plenty
of
to
the
majority
of
criminals
such
a
reflection
would
have
been
like
a
reprieve
from
death
but
the
brooding
brow
and
leaden
eye
of
this
man
told
that
there
was
no
balm
in
gilead
for
his
tortured
soul
and
that
wherever
he
went
and
to
the
last
breath
of
his
life
he
must
carry
with
him
like
an
incurable
malignant
cancer
the
knowledge
of
a
crime
horrifying
beyond
conception
to
his
mind
and
yet
unrepented
of
because
amply
justified
by
the
monstrous
circumstance
of
his
infidelity
his
unbalanced
mind
inveighed
against
heaven
for
loading
him
with
a
trial
so
far
beyond
mortal
strength
or
endurance
like
stormy
gusts
of
passion
these
wild
rebellious
thoughts
swept
across
his
mind
wrecking
and
devastating
the
training
of
a
lifetime
as
they
went
and
leaving
him
faint
and
breathless
with
their
fury
during
the
mental
lull
which
followed
one
of
these
outbursts
he
bethought
him
of
the
letter
of
which
the
handwriting
was
familiar
this
letter
which
he
had
selected
from
the
others
which
the
janitor
had
given
him
he
had
placed
in
his
pocket
and
he
now
essayed
to
open
it
the
jolting
of
the
cab
and
the
uncertain
light
of
the
street
however
made
him
change
his
mind
and
he
returned
the
letter
to
his
pocket
unopened
presently
the
cab
stopped
and
the
fugitive
alighted
upon
inquiry
he
found
that
his
friend
was
at
home
and
ready
to
see
him
these
two
men
had
been
bosom
friends
from
their
boyhood
and
their
friendship
had
in
maturer
years
become
intensified
and
solidified
by
the
fact
that
they
were
brother
masons
in
the
same
lodge
isamord
face
grew
white
and
grave
as
his
friend
told
him
of
the
events
of
that
terrible
evening
surely
must
be
dreaming
george
he
said
at
length
have
not
seen
much
of
your
wife
but
from
what
i
did
see
i
would
pledge
my
life
unhesitatingly
on
her
innocence
for
sake
man
go
back
to
while
i
live
will
i
willingly
look
on
her
face
this
was
said
fiercely
and
with
an
air
of
great
determination
but
with
a
quiver
in
the
brusqueness
of
his
voice
and
then
the
poor
tortured
soul
turned
his
head
to
hide
the
great
sobs
which
now
shook
his
frame
the
kindly
voice
and
the
sympathetic
eye
of
his
old
friend
had
for
the
time
being
exorcised
the
demon
of
jealousy
and
now
poor
george
montgomery
stood
revealed
a
most
miserable
man
forget
the
murder
at
length
he
faltered
could
i
ever
go
back
two
hours
later
hadley
left
his
house
in
company
with
george
montgomery
in
disguise
a
cab
took
them
to
the
docks
and
when
they
stepped
on
board
the
of
montgomery
was
introduced
to
the
captain
as
angus
forman
a
citizen
of
chicago
bound
for
cadiz
as
owner
of
the
vessel
hadley
bespoke
for
his
friend
every
kind
attention
and
assistance
which
the
captain
and
officers
could
render
him
before
leaving
he
took
an
opportunity
of
explaining
to
the
captain
that
his
journey
was
partly
undertaken
on
account
of
his
health
which
had
become
impaired
through
and
partly
through
a
recent
family
trouble
the
details
of
which
he
did
not
enter
into
at
the
of
raised
her
anchor
and
left
her
moorings
and
when
the
early
morning
dawned
she
was
fast
leaving
the
land
behind
her
as
the
outline
of
the
shore
grew
dim
the
solitary
passenger
on
board
the
of
strained
his
gaze
to
catch
the
latest
glimpse
of
land
and
the
summons
of
the
steward
to
breakfast
fell
unheeded
on
his
ears
at
length
when
the
haze
hid
the
land
from
view
and
only
the
heaving
billows
met
his
eye
on
every
side
he
turned
away
half
an
hour
later
the
captain
on
the
bridge
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
fall
prone
on
deck
the
occurrence
was
unusual
and
the
captain
left
his
post
to
ascertain
what
it
meant
he
found
his
guest
angus
forman
lying
insensible
with
an
open
letter
tightly
grasped
in
his
hand
by
the
orders
the
passenger
was
removed
to
his
cabin
where
he
shortly
afterwards
regained
consciousness
as
sensibility
returned
his
first
gaze
was
directed
to
the
letter
which
was
still
clenched
all
crumpled
in
his
stiffened
grasp
unhappy
wretch
that
i
am
and
more
than
murderer
he
moaned
poor
faithful
darling
i
have
killed
your
brother
and
now
you
must
loathe
me
forevermore
oh
why
did
i
leave
that
cursed
ring
there
to
establish
my
guilt
as
the
wailing
died
from
his
lips
he
turned
from
the
light
as
a
creature
stricken
to
death
retreats
to
the
darkest
corner
of
its
lair
to
die
in
that
night
the
strange
passenger
of
the
of
was
raving
in
delirium
and
for
weeks
while
the
sailing
vessel
ploughed
on
its
monotonous
way
he
lay
between
life
and
death
at
length
there
came
a
day
when
the
watchers
by
the
side
surrendered
all
hope
and
it
was
then
that
for
the
first
time
the
captain
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
read
the
letter
which
had
apparently
precipitated
the
catastrophe
in
itself
the
letter
gave
little
clue
to
the
secret
of
his
passenger
but
coupled
with
the
incoherent
ravings
the
captain
was
able
to
arrive
at
a
fairly
accurate
knowledge
of
what
the
secret
was
the
letter
was
addressed
to
george
montgomery
and
was
evidently
from
his
grandmother
in
it
the
writer
intimated
that
her
through
dread
that
it
might
lessen
her
love
for
her
had
concealed
from
him
the
fact
that
she
had
a
scapegrace
brother
the
old
lady
thought
that
secret
between
husband
and
wife
was
harmful
and
in
that
belief
she
had
thought
it
best
to
make
him
acquainted
with
the
fact
so
that
he
might
find
some
opportunity
to
pave
the
way
towards
inviting
his
full
confidence
and
so
remove
what
might
be
a
future
cause
of
grave
misunderstanding
am
the
more
anxious
to
set
you
two
right
on
this
matter
she
continued
i
feel
that
sooner
or
later
you
will
yourself
hear
of
my
wretched
grandson
from
outside
sources
and
if
the
indications
are
correct
sooner
rather
than
later
as
he
is
again
in
some
trouble
or
other
and
likely
to
come
for
help
to
his
sister
as
he
has
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
saw
him
lurking
about
our
house
but
my
eyesight
is
very
indifferent
and
i
can
not
speak
positively
as
to
the
letter
concluded
with
an
urgent
appeal
to
him
to
remember
his
sensitiveness
of
mind
as
well
as
her
delicacy
of
constitution
and
to
invite
and
not
force
her
confidence
after
he
had
finished
the
letter
the
captain
looked
at
the
name
on
the
envelope
he
was
a
trustworthy
man
and
beyond
a
prolonged
h
as
he
noted
the
discrepancy
between
the
names
of
montgomery
and
forman
he
gave
no
utterance
to
his
feelings
as
he
passed
to
his
cabin
where
he
again
sealed
up
the
letter
and
addressed
it
angus
forman
at
midnight
the
captain
was
summoned
to
the
sick
side
is
sinking
fast
explained
the
first
officer
in
a
low
tone
he
is
conscious
at
last
and
wishes
to
see
chapter
as
alice
montgomery
was
returning
to
the
house
from
the
peach
walk
where
she
had
met
her
brother
according
to
his
appointment
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
husband
hastily
entering
the
wood
he
was
walking
fast
and
before
she
had
decided
to
call
to
him
he
had
entered
the
wood
and
was
lost
to
her
sight
is
searching
for
me
she
murmured
pleased
at
his
apparent
precipitancy
and
yet
a
little
anxious
as
to
how
she
was
to
explain
her
failure
to
meet
him
as
she
followed
him
into
the
wood
her
steps
grew
slower
as
she
found
herself
unable
to
frame
to
her
entire
satisfaction
an
excuse
for
her
very
glaring
omission
must
have
gone
to
the
lake
thinking
to
find
me
there
she
presently
surmised
as
she
came
to
two
cross
forest
paths
saying
this
she
entered
the
road
opposite
to
that
which
her
husband
had
taken
when
she
reached
the
and
found
it
empty
a
look
of
alarm
for
the
first
time
crossed
her
face
i
hope
he
has
not
met
tom
she
whispered
to
herself
half
in
dismay
at
that
instant
a
shot
rang
through
the
wood
startling
her
almost
into
a
cry
wonder
what
that
can
be
she
exclaimed
has
no
but
perhaps
it
is
some
one
shooting
at
the
after
a
hesitation
she
retraced
her
steps
towards
the
direction
of
the
report
and
passed
into
the
taken
by
her
husband
some
ten
minutes
previously
this
brought
her
to
the
turnpike
road
which
was
deserted
but
for
an
object
lying
on
the
ground
some
fifty
yards
away
and
not
clearly
discernible
at
that
distance
in
the
fading
light
a
strange
tremor
filled
her
breast
and
almost
palsied
her
limbs
as
she
moved
towards
the
inanimate
object
lying
so
still
and
awful
and
now
as
she
neared
it
fast
taking
the
semblance
of
a
human
body
there
are
moments
whose
experience
no
pen
can
describe
and
far
be
it
from
us
to
attempt
the
impossible
what
of
agony
and
horror
alice
montgomery
suffered
when
she
saw
her
brother
lying
dead
on
the
public
highway
while
his
parting
kiss
was
yet
warm
on
her
lips
to
be
understood
must
be
endured
her
first
impulse
was
to
give
way
to
her
uncontrollable
grief
but
at
that
instant
her
straining
eyes
caught
sight
of
an
object
which
froze
the
first
cry
on
her
lips
this
was
the
new
which
shone
cold
and
distinct
against
the
dark
coat
worn
by
the
dead
man
as
it
lay
there
it
seemed
to
voice
the
full
intent
with
which
the
murderer
had
placed
it
on
his
breast
as
if
carved
in
pale
cold
marble
the
young
bride
stood
there
staring
at
the
dead
body
and
at
the
awful
ring
shrieking
out
its
horrid
tale
so
silent
and
still
she
stood
that
the
birds
fluttered
near
to
her
on
the
road
and
the
squirrels
stopped
midway
in
their
flight
and
sat
upright
in
the
dusty
way
to
regard
her
then
like
a
statue
endowed
with
vitality
she
stooped
and
removed
the
ring
from
its
place
murmuring
in
a
low
monotone
ring
he
bought
for
me
then
she
looked
at
it
strangely
and
almost
coldly
and
finally
placed
it
in
her
only
a
little
shiver
and
a
gasp
disturbed
the
calm
that
was
all
with
a
desperate
effort
and
with
a
bordering
on
the
horrible
she
removed
the
revolver
of
which
the
handle
was
discernible
from
the
dead
pocket
and
peered
into
each
separate
chamber
alas
they
were
all
full
for
an
instant
the
long
white
fingers
grasped
the
weapon
and
then
a
cartridge
driven
from
its
place
fell
into
her
palm
this
she
also
placed
in
her
then
she
stooped
and
picked
up
the
empty
shell
which
the
murderer
had
cast
from
his
revolver
after
firing
would
it
fit
her
weapon
it
did
the
pistols
were
of
the
same
smith
wesson
make
and
also
of
similar
calibre
her
next
task
was
a
still
more
terrible
one
but
it
was
performed
without
a
tremor
of
the
quick
and
capable
fingers
with
gentle
yet
unfaltering
touch
she
took
the
from
her
vest
pocket
and
having
abstracted
a
single
match
from
it
she
returned
it
to
its
place
then
moving
into
the
shadow
of
the
wood
lest
the
flame
should
attract
attention
she
applied
the
lighted
match
to
the
empty
chamber
smoking
and
discoloring
it
as
if
the
pistol
had
been
recently
fired
this
done
she
laid
the
revolver
close
to
the
outstretched
hand
of
the
dead
man
forgive
me
she
said
in
a
low
tone
making
my
brother
a
suicide
but
it
is
to
save
my
this
was
said
with
the
same
unnatural
calm
and
then
the
speaker
knelt
beside
the
dead
man
and
kissed
him
on
the
lips
which
were
still
unchilled
by
death
once
twice
three
times
her
lips
colder
than
those
of
the
dead
sought
his
face
then
she
took
out
her
handkerchief
to
wipe
the
blood
which
was
penetrating
the
poor
unseeing
eyes
then
remembering
the
part
which
she
had
to
play
she
refrained
help
me
my
deceit
has
killed
my
brother
i
must
try
to
save
my
murmuring
this
she
turned
from
the
dreadful
spectacle
on
the
road
and
passed
into
the
wood
with
a
strange
mechanical
woodenness
of
step
as
if
the
shock
which
had
spared
her
brain
and
hands
had
benumbed
or
paralyzed
her
lower
limbs
as
she
neared
the
house
her
grandfather
rose
from
his
seat
on
the
piazza
and
advanced
to
meet
her
is
the
matter
child
he
cried
alarmed
beyond
measure
at
the
ghastly
face
on
which
the
seal
of
a
great
horror
had
been
stamped
and
alarmed
no
less
at
the
unnatural
calm
of
his
manner
as
she
stood
before
him
with
staring
eyes
whose
dilated
pupils
suggested
insanity
go
down
to
the
road
she
murmured
pantingly
and
with
a
strange
catch
in
her
voice
by
the
white
elm
tree
something
terrible
has
happened
to
and
her
gruesome
work
being
ended
poor
nature
gave
way
and
she
fell
unconscious
to
the
ground
when
she
had
been
restored
to
sensibility
and
carried
to
her
room
her
grandfather
calling
the
colored
butler
to
follow
him
went
to
investigate
the
cause
of
her
emotion
the
gardener
who
was
found
watering
the
plants
in
the
front
was
also
summoned
to
accompany
his
master
what
the
three
found
the
reader
already
knows
the
old
grandfather
uttered
no
sound
and
only
the
exclamations
of
the
horrified
servants
broke
the
weird
silence
lamp
and
a
stretcher
julius
quick
exclaimed
the
old
man
silencing
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
the
lamentations
of
the
others
then
he
stooped
and
put
his
ear
to
the
chest
of
the
silent
figure
long
and
patiently
he
listened
and
then
as
if
reluctant
to
believe
the
worst
or
still
uncertain
he
undid
the
coat
and
vest
and
his
ear
to
catch
the
faintest
flicker
of
life
if
it
be
that
any
such
were
left
in
the
prostrate
body
ear
is
younger
than
mine
try
whether
you
can
hear
any
action
in
his
this
was
said
to
the
butler
who
bent
his
head
in
silent
obedience
to
the
commands
of
his
master
to
me
that
i
can
hear
sah
the
minutes
appeared
hours
while
the
two
waited
in
the
gathering
gloom
for
the
return
of
julius
with
the
lamp
and
the
stretcher
at
last
however
he
arrived
and
the
inanimate
body
was
carried
gently
to
the
house
five
minutes
later
a
mounted
groom
left
for
the
nearest
doctor
when
the
latter
had
made
his
examination
he
announced
that
life
was
not
extinct
and
that
while
it
hung
by
a
thread
there
was
still
room
for
hope
the
bullet
had
fractured
the
skull
and
caused
concussion
of
the
brain
but
the
latter
organ
had
not
been
penetrated
the
missile
having
glanced
from
the
bone
in
consequence
of
the
slanting
position
of
the
forehead
at
the
moment
of
fire
think
it
right
to
tell
you
the
doctor
said
at
parting
while
the
life
may
possibly
be
saved
his
reason
will
probably
be
endangered
do
you
think
the
young
man
intended
to
commit
suicide
he
added
by
way
of
inquiry
as
his
last
remark
was
received
in
silence
think
not
was
the
reply
was
full
of
life
and
was
constantly
getting
into
trouble
but
nothing
weighed
heavily
on
his
mind
no
i
imagine
that
he
took
out
his
revolver
to
fire
at
some
squirrel
perhaps
and
while
examining
the
chambers
to
see
whether
they
were
all
loaded
he
probably
touched
the
unintentionally
i
think
that
is
perhaps
the
correct
solution
of
the
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
said
the
doctor
as
he
turned
to
go
chapter
vi
when
the
young
bride
alice
montgomery
pale
and
wan
the
mere
spectre
of
her
former
self
left
the
sick
room
for
the
first
time
a
month
had
elapsed
from
the
date
of
the
events
narrated
in
the
last
chapter
the
interval
had
brought
no
tidings
of
her
missing
husband
beyond
the
intelligence
conveyed
by
his
partner
that
he
had
visited
the
office
on
the
night
of
his
departure
and
arranged
for
her
maintenance
during
a
prolonged
absence
this
uncertainty
as
to
his
fate
had
greatly
retarded
her
recovery
and
the
triumph
which
her
youth
had
thus
gained
in
dragging
her
back
to
life
was
as
yet
too
uncertain
to
mitigate
the
anxiety
felt
by
her
aged
relatives
her
brother
had
recovered
from
his
wound
and
had
in
a
measure
regained
his
health
but
the
mental
disorder
predicted
by
the
medical
adviser
was
now
only
too
apparent
of
the
occurrences
of
that
dreadful
night
he
had
evidently
no
recollection
and
he
never
spoke
of
them
his
mind
seemed
perpetually
occupied
with
monetary
troubles
and
no
assurance
on
the
part
of
his
grandfather
that
these
had
all
been
adjusted
served
to
allay
his
apprehension
from
a
youthful
irrational
creature
of
erratic
habits
he
seemed
suddenly
to
have
passed
into
careworn
middle
life
burdened
with
a
thousand
gloomy
anxieties
altogether
the
house
of
arlington
lay
in
a
sombre
shadow
during
those
bright
summer
days
and
many
silvery
hairs
were
added
to
its
aged
heads
in
the
long
weeks
of
trouble
and
grief
through
which
they
had
to
pass
have
you
got
my
purse
suddenly
asked
the
young
bride
while
seated
on
the
veranda
one
afternoon
in
the
early
days
of
her
convalescence
dear
replied
the
other
a
delicate
flush
mantling
her
cheeks
as
she
thought
of
its
contents
the
cartridge
and
the
i
fetch
it
dear
has
anyone
else
seen
it
grannie
love
i
have
kept
it
locked
up
since
the
night
of
the
the
no
more
passed
between
these
two
on
the
subject
but
each
understood
the
other
and
if
the
gloom
did
not
lighten
with
the
mutual
understanding
their
hearts
grew
stronger
to
endure
its
burden
do
you
not
wear
your
her
grandmother
inquired
one
day
lost
it
the
morning
george
a
look
of
perplexity
crossed
the
face
but
the
trouble
in
her
eyes
checked
further
inquiry
when
the
of
sailed
into
the
port
of
cadiz
the
captain
of
the
vessel
handed
a
sealed
envelope
to
his
passenger
angus
forman
with
the
assurance
somewhat
stiffly
delivered
that
his
secret
whatever
it
might
be
was
safe
with
him
the
other
received
the
envelope
in
silence
and
when
he
broke
the
seal
and
found
the
letter
from
his
grandmother
which
had
been
the
means
of
revealing
his
identity
he
read
it
again
without
apparent
emotion
during
the
long
weeks
of
delirium
and
slow
recovery
to
health
in
which
he
had
passed
the
interval
of
the
sailing
slow
passage
he
had
discounted
all
human
misery
it
seemed
to
him
and
as
he
stood
on
the
deck
the
mere
skeleton
of
his
former
self
he
felt
alike
indifferent
to
the
approach
of
weal
or
woe
far
down
in
his
breast
there
ached
the
dull
ceaseless
pain
of
a
love
forever
lost
which
drowned
every
other
feeling
and
made
him
indifferent
to
it
when
the
officers
came
aboard
he
was
surprised
after
a
languid
fashion
and
as
one
thinking
of
some
casual
acquaintance
rather
than
himself
that
no
detectives
accompanied
them
and
that
he
was
not
arrested
for
murder
but
when
he
found
that
no
inquiry
was
made
for
him
and
he
was
at
liberty
to
go
and
come
as
he
pleased
there
was
no
corresponding
relief
or
elation
visible
in
his
manner
on
bidding
the
captain
adieu
he
thanked
him
for
his
great
kindness
owe
you
my
life
he
remarked
when
i
am
certain
that
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
preserving
it
i
will
thank
you
more
warmly
with
which
enigmatical
sentence
he
passed
ashore
as
health
returned
his
tortured
mind
sought
relief
in
excitement
and
he
left
cadiz
for
madrid
where
he
strove
to
allay
the
grief
which
gnawed
at
his
heart
by
plunging
into
the
wild
excitement
of
that
and
capital
after
a
time
the
ferocious
excitement
of
the
weekly
bull
fight
ceased
to
deaden
the
agony
which
preyed
at
his
heart
and
he
allied
himself
with
a
revolutionary
movement
which
had
the
advantage
of
promising
equal
excitement
with
some
risk
to
the
life
which
had
long
been
a
burden
to
him
the
carlist
rising
seemed
like
the
first
glimpse
of
good
will
to
him
and
as
such
he
embraced
the
opportunity
it
afforded
the
contagious
excitement
aroused
by
the
pretender
thrilled
through
his
being
and
at
length
he
opened
his
soul
to
his
it
were
more
correct
perhaps
to
say
since
his
sole
companion
and
confidant
was
a
spanish
soldier
of
fortune
whose
desperate
circumstances
as
narrated
by
himself
had
first
melted
the
icy
reserve
which
begirt
the
wanderer
as
the
two
travelled
together
to
the
front
the
stranger
by
insidious
inquiries
gathered
piecemeal
george
history
more
particularly
however
he
seemed
interested
in
the
bulky
telegraphic
code
which
the
other
carried
with
him
and
he
was
puzzled
he
said
with
his
eternal
smile
to
understand
how
a
book
of
the
kind
could
be
of
any
practical
value
he
appeared
to
be
unlettered
in
business
ways
and
the
other
to
while
away
the
long
evenings
explained
to
him
the
working
of
the
code
as
he
would
have
elucidated
any
ordinary
puzzle
seems
plain
to
you
it
said
his
friend
one
night
laughingly
as
he
clasped
his
head
in
his
palms
at
the
end
of
a
long
explanation
i
swear
the
whole
thing
is
greek
to
me
i
suppose
my
brain
must
be
unusually
that
night
a
false
alarm
was
given
and
in
the
confusion
george
montgomery
was
parted
from
his
friend
when
order
was
at
length
restored
and
the
former
endeavored
to
collect
his
baggage
he
found
that
his
telegraphic
cipher
was
missing
a
hasty
march
was
made
from
the
dangerous
locality
and
in
the
darkness
he
was
parted
from
his
friend
whom
he
did
not
see
again
is
the
fortune
of
war
he
remarked
somewhat
bitterly
to
himself
for
he
had
grown
to
like
his
friend
and
in
the
daily
exigencies
of
an
exciting
life
he
soon
forgot
his
passing
acquaintance
the
date
of
this
alarm
was
the
of
august
on
the
the
firm
of
alford
montgomery
in
new
york
received
a
cable
message
in
cipher
of
which
the
translation
was
remit
by
cable
to
the
bank
of
madrid
five
thousand
dollars
payable
to
my
order
without
identification
on
receipt
of
this
despatch
the
firm
telegraphed
to
montgomery
and
received
in
reply
a
request
to
assure
her
husband
that
all
was
well
and
to
beg
him
to
return
to
his
wife
without
delay
on
the
evening
of
the
the
atlantic
cable
carried
the
following
message
in
cipher
have
remitted
five
thousand
dollars
by
cable
as
requested
your
wife
entreats
you
to
return
and
says
is
when
this
message
was
delivered
and
translated
the
receiver
smiled
strangely
as
he
lit
a
fresh
cigar
adding
after
he
had
established
its
fire
how
easy
it
has
been
only
sorry
friend
montgomery
that
i
did
not
cable
for
twenty
thousand
dollars
instead
of
five
thousand
dollars
it
was
a
bright
idea
to
steal
that
very
useful
code
of
at
that
moment
the
clank
of
a
heavy
sabre
on
the
marble
floor
of
the
hotel
smote
on
his
ear
and
the
weight
of
a
heavy
hand
fell
on
his
shoulder
arrest
you
señor
at
the
instance
of
the
bank
of
charge
fiercely
ejaculated
the
other
finding
his
struggles
useless
was
the
grim
and
laconic
reply
well
that
is
an
old
hallucination
of
the
and
easily
answered
let
me
light
a
cigarette
any
way
urged
the
other
with
simulated
indifference
as
he
turned
the
folded
dispatch
towards
the
light
the
officer
made
no
objection
and
presently
his
prisoner
ground
the
ashes
of
the
telegraphic
message
beneath
his
heel
at
arlington
alice
montgomery
waited
with
agonizing
anxiety
for
a
cabled
reply
to
the
loving
message
which
she
had
sent
across
the
ocean
to
her
unhappy
husband
as
the
days
passed
without
bringing
her
any
answering
message
she
persuaded
her
partner
to
telegraph
again
to
madrid
still
no
response
and
still
another
message
sped
on
its
way
beneath
the
ocean
only
however
to
result
in
the
same
stony
silence
at
length
in
reply
to
a
letter
sent
to
the
bank
of
madrid
there
came
the
intelligence
that
the
remitted
had
never
been
applied
for
and
that
the
cable
company
had
only
been
able
to
deliver
the
first
message
all
the
others
being
still
at
the
hotel
where
the
husband
had
received
the
first
one
perhaps
the
information
that
her
husband
had
received
the
loving
message
which
she
had
sent
him
and
had
closed
his
ears
and
his
heart
to
her
piteous
appeal
was
the
bitterest
drop
in
the
cup
of
affliction
and
for
a
while
it
seemed
as
if
in
grinding
out
the
ashes
of
the
cablegram
beneath
his
heel
in
the
hotel
at
madrid
the
villain
who
had
stolen
george
cipher
had
likewise
ground
out
the
life
of
his
now
thoroughly
heartbroken
wife
but
no
thought
of
compunction
crossed
the
mind
of
the
felon
now
languishing
in
a
spanish
cell
and
torturing
his
mind
how
best
he
could
manage
to
get
hold
of
that
money
in
the
bank
so
that
with
a
portion
of
it
he
might
bribe
his
jailers
and
regain
his
freedom
wonder
how
my
american
friend
enjoys
fighting
the
spanish
troops
he
smilingly
queried
of
himself
one
day
as
he
sat
under
the
great
wall
of
the
prison
court
rolling
a
fresh
cigarette
at
that
moment
george
montgomery
sorely
wounded
was
bleeding
his
life
out
on
the
sunny
slopes
of
the
sierra
morena
mountains
and
murmuring
brokenly
now
faintly
now
passionately
as
his
fever
ebbed
and
flowed
the
name
of
his
dearly
loved
wife
whom
fate
had
at
last
to
all
appearances
forever
separated
from
him
chapter
vii
in
a
spanish
monastery
george
montgomery
recovered
from
the
wounds
which
had
so
nearly
proved
fatal
and
when
the
last
gleanings
of
the
autumnal
crop
of
grapes
shrivelled
on
its
southern
walls
he
felt
the
dawnings
of
returning
convalescence
as
his
eye
released
from
the
shadow
of
death
swept
the
panorama
of
mountain
ranges
and
smiling
valleys
visible
from
his
lofty
eyrie
in
the
monastery
earth
seemed
very
fair
to
him
and
the
life
so
hardly
retained
acquired
a
double
value
in
his
sight
his
mind
with
recovering
strength
began
to
regain
its
equilibrium
and
his
disordered
brain
was
at
last
able
to
review
in
proper
perspective
the
situation
as
between
himself
and
first
his
wife
and
second
his
crime
as
his
thoughts
purged
from
the
dross
of
passion
in
that
habitation
where
nothing
unworthy
could
live
calmly
reviewed
the
situation
he
felt
abased
to
think
how
selfishly
he
had
acted
how
cowardly
indeed
he
thought
as
he
scourged
himself
with
bitter
clear
to
him
it
seemed
as
the
evening
star
which
rose
on
his
view
nightly
and
darkened
every
other
constellation
by
its
brilliancy
that
his
duty
was
to
have
communicated
with
his
wife
on
the
first
available
moment
after
learning
of
the
horrible
mistake
he
had
made
in
assuming
her
brother
to
be
her
lover
and
this
he
ought
to
have
done
at
all
hazards
to
himself
was
it
too
late
what
might
not
have
happened
in
those
months
of
silence
these
questions
tortured
his
mind
day
by
day
with
violence
and
finally
and
reluctantly
the
holy
brotherhood
permitted
the
departure
of
the
wounded
man
in
order
to
enable
him
while
yet
perhaps
there
was
time
to
make
atonement
for
a
grievous
wrong
he
bade
the
monks
adieu
with
unfeigned
regret
the
odor
of
sanctity
which
seemed
to
pervade
the
very
walls
of
the
monastery
had
impressed
him
powerfully
he
had
seen
how
while
ministering
to
human
trouble
and
endowed
with
broad
human
sympathies
the
brothers
still
held
themselves
from
the
world
and
he
felt
on
bidding
them
farewell
like
an
african
traveler
who
driven
by
desperate
circumstances
leaves
behind
him
the
last
well
and
the
last
glimpse
of
verdure
to
plunge
into
the
unknown
and
illimitable
desert
beyond
strewn
with
the
skeletons
of
those
who
have
gone
before
he
shuddered
at
times
when
he
reflected
what
possibly
awaited
him
as
he
remembered
that
awful
figure
lying
on
the
cold
road
with
the
night
descending
on
it
like
a
pall
he
shuddered
but
he
did
not
hesitate
the
monastic
teachings
had
cleared
his
brain
and
outlined
a
path
which
he
had
determined
to
follow
if
his
life
lasted
until
he
reached
the
desired
goal
he
still
had
ample
funds
in
his
possession
and
he
was
accordingly
able
to
reach
cadiz
without
delay
immediately
on
arriving
he
wrote
a
long
letter
to
his
wife
explaining
fully
the
circumstances
under
which
he
had
fled
he
concealed
nothing
it
was
part
of
his
merited
punishment
he
felt
and
that
not
the
least
painful
to
be
compelled
to
make
the
humiliating
confession
to
his
wife
that
he
had
suspected
her
fidelity
even
during
their
honeymoon
the
writing
of
this
letter
was
a
terrible
ordeal
and
called
into
distressing
activity
the
keenest
emotions
never
perhaps
had
the
reasons
for
utter
despair
taken
such
palpable
shape
as
when
the
closing
lines
of
his
own
letter
lay
before
him
in
all
their
stern
significance
shall
never
cease
to
love
you
while
life
lasts
these
said
i
know
that
i
can
now
awake
in
you
only
feelings
of
abhorrence
as
the
murderer
of
your
brother
i
will
not
try
to
see
you
again
for
indeed
i
think
that
one
glance
of
reproach
from
your
eyes
would
kill
me
outright
where
i
stood
am
leaving
this
city
within
hours
not
to
return
i
can
not
give
you
my
address
and
i
would
not
if
i
could
i
have
only
one
request
to
make
that
you
will
endeavor
to
blot
all
recollection
of
my
most
unhappy
self
from
your
mind
and
even
that
miserable
solace
is
i
feel
to
be
denied
me
for
however
time
might
efface
all
memory
of
me
as
a
husband
eternity
itself
could
not
obliterate
the
horrible
recollection
of
me
as
your
the
following
day
when
the
of
sailed
for
cuba
george
montgomery
or
rather
angus
forman
for
he
had
resumed
his
assumed
name
was
one
of
the
passengers
why
he
had
made
the
west
indies
his
objective
point
he
might
perhaps
have
been
unable
truthfully
to
decide
the
reason
that
he
gave
to
himself
was
that
his
mind
required
yet
another
change
of
scene
while
his
enfeebled
body
demanded
that
it
should
be
to
a
still
warmer
clime
deep
down
in
his
heart
however
he
was
conscious
of
another
reason
a
craving
or
to
be
nearer
the
mecca
of
his
heart
he
fought
in
vain
against
the
tumultuous
joy
which
swelled
in
his
breast
when
an
inward
voice
whispered
day
by
day
and
louder
and
louder
as
the
vessel
surged
on
its
way
home
and
yet
he
told
himself
with
a
despair
to
which
each
breath
of
hope
added
keener
poignancy
that
the
second
half
of
that
way
his
feet
would
never
traverse
on
the
fifth
day
out
from
cadiz
an
event
occurred
which
had
considerable
effect
on
his
after
life
as
he
stood
on
the
deck
listlessly
watching
a
school
of
porpoises
which
had
raced
alongside
the
ship
he
was
conscious
of
a
considerable
commotion
among
the
sailors
the
cause
was
the
discovery
of
a
stowaway
among
the
merchandise
in
the
hold
as
the
wretched
prisoner
was
dragged
forward
for
the
inspection
montgomery
recognized
in
him
his
old
companion
the
spanish
soldier
of
fortune
de
leon
who
had
disappeared
on
the
night
of
the
alarm
when
they
were
on
their
way
to
join
the
forces
of
don
carlos
to
the
readers
this
enterprising
gentleman
is
known
as
the
man
who
stole
the
telegraphic
cipher
who
used
it
to
cable
for
and
who
finally
wound
up
in
a
spanish
prison
before
his
roguery
was
consummated
to
his
satisfaction
by
appealing
to
the
cupidity
of
his
jailer
he
had
at
last
induced
the
latter
to
secure
a
temporary
substitute
and
leave
of
absence
for
a
few
hours
from
the
jail
in
order
to
obtain
the
money
from
the
bank
which
the
latter
had
been
instructed
to
pay
over
to
george
montgomery
on
demand
he
had
gone
to
the
bank
under
the
keen
surveillance
of
his
confederate
the
jailer
only
to
find
however
that
the
advice
to
pay
the
money
had
been
cancelled
this
was
a
to
his
hopes
but
the
hardy
villain
surmising
that
liberty
even
without
wealth
was
better
than
incarceration
determined
to
make
a
bold
dash
for
liberty
while
he
had
the
chance
watching
his
opportunity
he
tripped
up
his
disappointed
and
now
furious
companion
the
jailer
with
such
violence
as
to
rob
that
baffled
functionary
of
what
little
intelligence
he
possessed
for
the
space
of
several
minutes
de
knowledge
of
the
purlieus
of
madrid
enabled
him
to
hide
in
safety
until
a
suitable
opportunity
arose
for
him
to
leave
the
city
and
through
his
ingenuity
as
an
adventurer
he
was
able
to
reach
the
coast
in
safety
there
after
a
time
he
had
been
able
to
secrete
himself
on
board
the
of
while
the
careless
sailors
were
enjoying
their
afternoon
siesta
on
board
this
spanish
ship
the
views
of
a
crime
were
to
say
the
least
somewhat
harsh
the
wretched
starved
condition
and
the
misery
of
his
appearance
aroused
no
spark
of
pity
in
the
breast
of
the
unfeeling
skipper
whose
moustache
bristled
with
rage
at
the
thought
of
the
daring
and
effrontery
of
the
man
who
had
perpetrated
such
a
fraud
upon
him
and
the
owners
of
the
ship
lashes
on
the
bare
back
at
once
and
to
be
handed
over
to
the
authorities
in
havana
on
landing
was
the
sentence
decreed
with
the
accompaniment
of
many
elaborate
and
inspiring
castilian
oaths
by
the
haughty
spaniard
his
desperate
situation
paralyzed
the
stowaway
into
silence
one
glance
at
the
ruthless
face
of
the
captain
satisfied
the
poor
wretch
whose
career
as
an
adventurer
enabled
him
to
read
the
human
countenance
like
an
open
page
that
appeal
was
hopeless
while
of
means
of
escape
there
were
none
with
only
the
wide
waste
of
waters
as
a
refuge
as
the
hunted
gaze
of
the
captive
scanned
all
the
faces
around
him
he
suddenly
drew
back
as
if
struck
in
the
face
by
a
blow
and
cast
his
eyes
downward
to
the
deck
he
had
recognized
george
montgomery
in
an
instant
he
summed
up
the
situation
in
this
wise
this
man
identifies
me
i
shall
be
handed
over
to
the
authorities
at
havana
not
as
a
suspicious
character
but
as
a
thief
and
a
forger
and
that
added
to
my
conspiracy
with
the
jailer
and
my
escape
will
ensure
me
twenty
years
of
the
as
these
thoughts
crashed
like
a
shell
through
de
brain
he
forgot
about
the
flogging
which
he
was
going
to
receive
the
enormity
of
the
terrible
punishment
awaiting
him
in
spain
obliterating
every
other
thought
all
his
native
hardihood
had
deserted
him
and
he
hung
limp
and
with
closed
eyes
against
the
mast
to
which
he
had
been
lashed
in
readiness
for
the
ordered
whipping
he
was
vaguely
conscious
of
a
sudden
silence
among
the
men
around
him
and
at
length
opening
his
eyes
fearfully
he
saw
montgomery
in
conversation
with
the
captain
and
pointing
towards
him
he
saw
or
at
least
concluded
that
his
worst
fears
had
been
realized
that
the
man
he
had
robbed
had
recognized
him
and
as
he
fancied
he
could
hear
him
detailing
the
particulars
of
his
crime
he
closed
his
eyes
hurriedly
and
the
pallor
on
his
face
whitened
to
the
hue
of
death
in
his
conclusion
that
montgomery
had
recognized
him
the
miserable
culprit
was
correct
but
as
the
reader
is
aware
the
former
had
no
cognizance
of
his
theft
or
of
his
other
attempted
frauds
and
his
conversation
with
the
captain
at
the
moment
was
simply
a
proposition
to
pay
double
compensation
to
the
owners
for
the
fare
of
which
they
had
been
defrauded
together
with
a
handsome
to
the
captain
himself
for
the
liberation
of
the
prisoner
the
captain
listened
in
moody
silence
but
under
his
lids
an
avaricious
gleam
shot
outwards
and
downwards
he
is
an
old
of
mine
and
a
right
good
fellow
let
him
go
if
you
had
ever
seen
him
as
i
have
seen
him
in
good
circumstances
you
would
be
shocked
at
the
change
in
his
appearance
he
has
suffered
enough
already
god
this
appeal
moved
the
captain
not
one
whit
but
it
provided
a
way
for
him
to
secure
the
proffered
consideration
and
the
grimness
of
his
features
relaxed
as
if
the
other
had
released
him
from
a
disagreeable
and
painful
duty
from
which
naturally
his
whole
soul
revolted
no
more
señor
your
assurance
as
to
that
unfortunate
respectability
is
received
unreservedly
i
can
of
course
accept
nothing
for
myself
the
knowledge
that
i
have
been
of
service
to
you
is
in
itself
sufficient
reward
this
with
a
profound
bow
and
radiant
smile
but
my
duty
to
the
owners
of
the
ship
compels
me
to
accept
your
offer
to
recoup
us
for
this
passage
money
if
however
you
will
see
the
purser
these
details
can
be
readily
arranged
i
will
instruct
him
to
receive
the
money
whereupon
the
captain
left
for
the
office
when
george
montgomery
had
settled
accounts
with
the
purser
he
had
not
only
paid
double
fare
for
his
erring
friend
but
he
had
in
response
to
a
somewhat
broad
hint
from
the
purser
paid
a
further
sum
of
which
the
latter
intimated
would
be
the
probable
fine
imposed
on
the
captain
if
it
were
discovered
by
the
owners
that
he
had
not
inflicted
the
usual
punishment
on
the
stowaway
perhaps
it
was
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
the
owners
discovering
such
a
flagrant
dereliction
of
duty
that
no
entries
were
made
in
the
books
of
the
sums
handed
over
that
day
when
george
montgomery
returned
on
deck
he
found
the
inanimate
figure
of
his
old
still
bound
to
the
mast
in
response
to
his
glance
of
surprise
at
the
captain
the
latter
explained
with
a
smile
and
another
overpowering
bow
that
he
thought
señor
forman
might
like
to
release
the
prisoner
himself
accepting
a
knife
tendered
by
one
of
the
crew
he
advanced
to
the
mast
the
sight
of
the
pale
and
haggard
features
covered
with
the
glassy
moisture
of
a
sudden
and
unspeakable
terror
might
have
moved
a
heart
of
stone
the
heavy
lids
still
tightly
closed
the
horrified
eyes
and
the
whole
aspect
was
that
of
the
dead
have
come
to
release
you
george
whispered
in
his
ear
but
the
other
gave
no
sign
save
only
that
a
dark
flush
began
to
creep
up
over
his
neck
you
remember
me
old
friend
great
heavens
a
glass
of
brandy
here
quick
the
man
is
dying
the
eyes
had
opened
wide
and
stared
horribly
while
you
might
count
five
and
the
fugitive
color
had
died
suddenly
away
and
the
body
fallen
a
dead
weight
on
the
ropes
but
news
never
kills
and
at
length
the
sorrowful
knight
of
fortune
recovered
consciousness
to
find
himself
alone
with
the
friend
whom
he
had
wronged
and
who
was
now
bending
over
him
in
eager
solicitude
his
bonds
had
been
removed
and
he
lay
in
his
cabin
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
he
was
not
the
victim
of
some
pleasing
hallucination
and
that
he
was
really
at
liberty
he
took
his
hand
between
both
his
own
and
kissed
it
again
and
again
while
the
hot
tears
rained
unheeded
from
his
poor
eyes
you
are
very
weak

chapter
viii
george
montgomery
took
an
early
opportunity
of
explaining
to
his
friend
de
leon
that
for
certain
reasons
he
was
traveling
under
an
assumed
name
to
the
other
it
is
lamentable
to
add
this
appeared
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
and
he
never
gave
the
matter
a
second
thought
the
devotion
of
the
rescued
stowaway
to
the
friend
who
had
saved
him
was
touching
in
the
extreme
he
followed
him
like
his
shadow
with
a
fidelity
which
awoke
the
sneers
of
the
supercilious
spaniards
there
were
occasions
when
these
sneers
roused
the
ire
of
the
patient
de
leon
and
prompt
retribution
seemed
very
near
the
heads
of
the
offenders
but
the
butt
of
their
shafts
recollected
himself
in
time
and
dissembled
his
wrath
conscious
that
he
was
not
yet
quite
out
of
danger
and
that
so
long
as
he
was
on
board
ship
and
within
touch
he
was
by
no
means
beyond
the
reach
of
spanish
malice
at
length
the
island
of
cuba
was
reached
and
the
two
friends
left
the
ship
in
safety
on
the
night
of
their
arrival
as
the
two
were
seated
in
the
hotel
pasaje
in
havana
the
second
officer
of
the
ship
who
had
been
celebrating
his
return
with
some
old
friends
entered
the
hotel
when
he
saw
de
leon
he
pointed
him
out
jeeringly
to
the
friends
who
accompanied
him
as
he
had
been
a
special
offender
in
this
respect
on
board
ship
so
that
it
scarcely
needed
the
fresh
insult
to
fire
de
blood
when
the
latter
noticed
that
the
companions
were
regarding
him
curiously
he
rose
to
his
feet
with
much
deliberation
and
lifting
his
full
from
the
table
he
threw
its
contents
straight
into
the
face
as
the
latter
endeavored
to
wipe
the
dark
claret
from
his
face
de
leon
with
the
air
of
a
grandee
of
spain
raised
his
hat
to
the
other
gentleman
then
fixing
his
gaze
on
the
officer
he
said
am
at
your
service
the
interposition
of
the
hotel
officials
prevented
any
continuation
of
the
quarrel
there
and
the
entire
party
left
together
george
montgomery
who
accompanied
his
friend
was
in
dismay
at
the
quarrel
and
the
duel
with
the
officer
which
seemed
impending
do
not
know
my
friend
what
you
are
about
if
you
knew
what
it
was
to
have
blood
on
your
hands
you
would
die
rather
than
shed
the
other
glanced
at
him
strangely
for
a
moment
and
then
replied
anything
but
this
i
would
obey
you
willingly
but
i
am
by
birth
a
spanish
noble
and
this
man
has
insulted
me
i
have
avenged
that
insult
and
now
i
should
be
a
coward
if
i
did
not
give
him
the
satisfaction
he
at
this
moment
one
of
the
friends
approached
montgomery
and
informed
him
courteously
that
the
gentleman
who
had
been
insulted
demanded
satisfaction
and
intimated
that
the
more
promptly
it
could
be
afforded
the
more
it
would
be
to
the
taste
of
his
principal
as
george
montgomery
hesitated
and
then
protested
that
nothing
would
induce
him
to
sanction
a
duel
de
leon
took
the
matter
into
his
own
hands
and
said
gentleman
is
the
only
friend
i
have
in
the
city
he
will
not
act
therefore
i
must
dispense
with
a
second
and
i
say
i
am
ready
now
to
meet
your
principal
i
have
no
preference
as
to
weapons
but
as
the
choice
rests
with
me
and
to
save
time
i
name
the
rapier
i
am
content
to
accompany
you
alone
and
as
soon
as
we
can
secure
the
weapons
i
will
go
with
you
and
settle
the
the
other
bowed
gravely
and
promising
to
return
in
a
few
minutes
he
left
for
the
present
at
least
exclaimed
de
leon
with
outstretched
hand
to
his
friend
as
his
second
returned
with
the
rapiers
under
his
arm
all
goes
well
i
will
return
to
the
hotel
in
a
couple
of
hours
and
if
not
why
then
dearest
of
friends
adieu
and
he
raised
the
hand
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
not
formally
but
tenderly
and
even
passionately
i
can
not
let
you
go
alone
returned
the
other
is
all
wrong
i
know
and
can
only
build
up
untold
misery
in
the
future
but
i
can
not
turn
my
back
on
a
in
reply
de
leon
pressed
his
hand
and
together
they
entered
one
of
three
carriages
which
had
been
summoned
for
the
use
of
the
party
a
drive
of
twenty
minutes
landed
them
on
a
lonely
spot
hedged
in
on
three
sides
by
lofty
palms
and
a
dense
undergrowth
of
palmetto
and
on
the
other
side
by
the
blue
waters
of
the
bay
where
a
solitary
craft
lay
moored
near
the
shore
the
moon
was
high
in
the
heavens
and
the
light
was
almost
as
clear
as
day
when
de
leon
ran
his
fingers
over
the
weapon
which
was
handed
to
him
he
seemed
jubilant
with
gaiety
friend
he
exclaimed
i
thought
i
was
going
to
die
i
would
make
a
confession
to
you
i
did
you
a
great
wrong
once
but
i
shall
spit
that
wretch
like
a
lark
and
i
can
not
afford
to
lose
your
friendship
so
my
confession
must
while
the
preliminary
arrangements
were
being
made
the
movement
on
shore
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
on
board
the
craft
at
anchor
a
few
hundred
yards
away
and
presently
a
boat
put
off
from
the
ship
containing
the
three
officers
on
duty
who
correctly
surmised
the
cause
of
the
unwonted
gathering
and
came
ashore
to
see
the
fight
as
they
joined
the
group
they
saluted
its
members
courteously
but
carelessly
as
men
who
were
seldom
wont
to
crave
permission
for
their
presence
and
were
indifferent
whether
it
was
accorded
or
not
an
impression
which
was
heightened
by
a
certain
swagger
in
their
manner
which
savored
more
of
the
buccaneer
than
of
the
naval
officer
and
also
by
a
superfluity
of
armament
about
their
persons
when
the
duellists
had
taken
their
places
the
contrast
in
the
expressions
of
the
two
principals
was
very
marked
on
de
face
there
was
an
air
of
smiling
assurance
which
seemed
to
goad
his
opponent
almost
to
fury
he
had
fully
regained
his
strength
during
the
weeks
which
had
elapsed
since
his
discovery
on
board
ship
as
a
stowaway
and
the
muscular
neck
and
powerful
arms
promised
that
given
equal
skill
the
observant
moon
would
have
left
her
proud
elevation
in
the
sky
before
his
physical
powers
would
surrender
to
mere
fatigue
at
last
the
signal
of
attack
was
given
and
the
fine
steel
blades
slid
along
each
other
as
their
owners
felt
their
way
to
the
attack
then
the
officer
shot
out
his
weapon
apparently
full
at
the
broad
breast
of
his
antagonist
but
no
harm
was
done
and
the
ring
of
the
steel
hilts
as
they
clashed
together
was
the
only
sound
which
was
borne
on
the
night
air
a
temporary
lock
of
blades
prevented
any
harm
being
done
and
when
they
were
disengaged
the
two
began
afresh
the
with
their
weapons
de
leon
however
had
already
gauged
his
ability
and
before
the
latter
could
fathom
his
intention
or
do
anything
beyond
blindly
advancing
his
weapon
the
rapier
had
disengaged
itself
from
his
blade
slid
like
a
lightning
flash
over
his
arm
and
pierced
his
neck
the
fight
was
over
almost
ere
the
weapon
was
withdrawn
and
the
officer
choked
with
blood
staggered
backwards
and
fell
into
the
arms
of
his
friends
at
that
instant
a
shrill
double
whistle
of
warning
was
heard
from
the
ship
and
the
three
officers
belonging
to
it
retraced
their
steps
rapidly
to
the
boat
at
the
same
moment
a
body
of
spanish
troops
plunged
through
the
palmetto
cutlass
in
hand
shouted
de
leon
to
the
retreating
officers
us
with
his
suspicious
brain
had
surmised
a
trap
and
he
was
afraid
of
the
troops
as
foes
the
law
and
order
of
spain
he
dreaded
as
much
as
suspected
christians
in
former
ages
feared
the
inquisition
the
reasons
which
impelled
the
officers
to
consent
to
his
request
may
probably
be
found
in
the
fact
that
both
looked
able
powerful
men
and
one
at
least
had
just
proved
himself
to
be
a
very
efficient
swordsman
right
in
with
you
quick
shouted
the
first
officer
by
way
of
reply
and
the
two
took
their
seats
hurriedly
in
the
boat
which
was
immediately
pushed
off
from
the
shore
the
vessel
was
found
on
a
closer
acquaintance
to
be
engaged
in
the
contraband
trade
and
the
captain
in
command
in
consideration
of
the
sum
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
agreed
to
land
the
two
passengers
on
the
mainland
of
florida
the
arrangement
suited
his
own
purposes
for
the
moment
although
he
would
have
preferred
to
retain
his
passengers
and
the
two
were
accordingly
landed
in
safety
at
punta
rassa
where
they
engaged
a
boat
and
its
owner
a
florida
oyster
dredger
of
villainous
appearance
and
had
they
known
it
of
still
more
evil
reputation
with
this
man
they
entered
into
a
contract
to
take
them
through
the
great
lake
okeechobee
with
which
he
assured
them
he
was
familiar
and
thence
northward
through
the
chain
of
canals
and
lakes
which
led
to
within
reasonable
distance
of
one
of
the
principal
termini
of
the
very
limited
railway
service
of
florida
why
did
george
montgomery
choose
such
a
route
he
would
probably
have
found
it
hard
to
furnish
a
reasonable
explanation
when
he
landed
in
the
state
it
seemed
sufficient
rapture
for
the
moment
to
feel
that
he
was
once
more
on
the
same
continent
with
his
wife
and
that
no
terrible
width
of
ocean
any
longer
divided
them
still
he
could
not
forget
that
he
was
a
fugitive
from
justice
and
that
in
all
probability
the
and
had
been
raised
against
him
as
the
murderer
of
his
he
shuddered
as
he
thought
that
on
his
first
visit
to
a
railway
station
he
might
be
confronted
by
a
reward
offered
for
his
own
apprehension
and
so
satisfied
with
the
thought
that
day
by
day
he
was
creeping
or
drifting
nearer
to
the
woman
for
whom
his
whole
soul
and
body
hankered
he
seemed
to
find
a
temporary
contentment
in
his
lot
his
preoccupation
of
mind
rendered
him
the
most
unsuspicious
of
mortals
and
so
hastened
a
catastrophe
which
came
near
terminating
prematurely
his
wanderings
in
taking
a
bundle
of
papers
from
his
pocket
one
day
a
package
of
notes
of
large
denomination
fell
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
parcel
represented
five
thousand
dollars
and
with
a
bill
as
its
outward
symbol
looked
it
must
be
confessed
its
full
value
as
the
eyes
of
the
boatman
fell
upon
the
parcel
they
glared
at
it
with
a
greed
of
covetousness
which
de
leon
read
at
a
glance
and
carefully
noted
the
owner
of
the
notes
neither
saw
nor
recked
of
the
commotion
aroused
by
his
carelessness
de
leon
however
not
only
saw
the
error
but
made
it
quite
clear
to
the
boatman
that
he
understood
him
my
dear
friend
there
is
trouble
for
us
both
ahead
de
leon
muttered
as
he
softly
soaked
the
cartridges
in
the
limpid
waters
of
lake
okeechobee
while
that
worthy
slept
he
resumed
a
soldier
of
fortune
my
worthy
ruffian
are
simply
a
murderer
but
beware
de
leon
watches
as
he
referred
to
himself
as
a
soldier
of
fortune
it
is
possible
that
he
was
endeavoring
to
discriminate
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
conscience
between
a
genius
of
haute
who
in
extremity
and
with
the
touch
of
a
master
borrows
a
telegraphic
cipher
and
uses
it
with
brilliant
if
ephemeral
result
and
a
simple
highway
robber
it
is
but
just
however
to
the
brave
de
leon
to
say
that
his
cheeks
tingled
with
shame
whenever
he
thought
of
the
very
scurvy
trick
he
had
once
played
on
his
old
and
unsuspecting
friend
in
stealing
his
code
and
suppressing
the
message
from
his
wife
it
is
a
sorry
business
to
rob
a
generous
man
who
trusts
you
as
de
leon
reflected
thus
the
boat
lay
at
anchor
for
the
night
on
the
broad
bosom
of
that
inland
sea
lake
okeechobee
think
he
whispered
to
himself
ought
to
mention
that
message
to
my
friend
it
might
lessen
his
distress
and
yet
how
i
let
him
know
how
i
have
wronged
him
and
tried
to
defraud
him
i
can
not
do
three
weeks
later
they
stopped
at
a
on
the
kissimmee
river
in
order
to
secure
some
fresh
food
they
had
passed
through
the
great
lake
in
safety
and
also
through
its
principal
tributary
to
a
point
north
of
fort
kissimmee
that
stoppage
was
the
first
of
any
consequence
since
they
had
left
lake
okeechobee
and
it
is
possible
that
the
careful
watch
observed
by
de
leon
having
been
without
result
up
to
that
time
his
vigils
had
grown
somewhat
careless
this
however
is
mere
conjecture
but
on
the
night
of
that
landing
de
leon
awoke
from
a
heavy
stupor
to
find
the
boatman
raising
his
axe
to
slay
his
friend
montgomery
de
leon
essayed
to
rise
to
his
feet
yelling
out
an
alarm
to
his
friend
as
he
did
so
the
assassin
however
had
taken
the
precaution
to
tie
some
ropes
across
the
limbs
loosely
enough
so
as
not
to
awake
him
yet
in
such
a
way
as
to
prevent
him
rendering
any
sudden
assistance
to
his
friend
the
immediate
result
of
de
alarm
was
to
divert
to
himself
the
blow
intended
for
his
friend
for
a
moment
the
yellow
devilish
face
of
the
boatman
bent
over
him
with
a
look
of
indescribable
malice
the
next
the
axe
descended
full
on
poor
de
helpless
head
and
with
a
groan
he
sank
unconscious
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
the
boatman
turned
in
time
to
see
that
montgomery
was
awake
and
feeling
for
his
pistol
then
recognizing
that
the
game
was
up
he
jumped
ashore
when
he
got
to
the
distance
of
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
boat
and
so
out
of
pistol
range
he
raised
his
rifle
which
he
had
taken
up
as
he
left
the
boat
and
fired
thanks
however
to
poor
de
thoughtfulness
in
saturating
the
cartridges
the
murderous
intentions
were
foiled
although
he
tried
shell
after
shell
before
he
gave
up
as
useless
his
efforts
to
kill
montgomery
the
latter
oblivious
of
the
persistent
attempts
to
shoot
him
was
stooping
over
his
wounded
friend
endeavoring
to
stay
the
frightful
loss
of
blood
from
the
blow
given
him
by
the
native
the
wound
had
not
been
what
it
had
been
intended
to
be
immediately
fatal
when
de
leon
saw
the
axe
descending
he
had
moved
his
head
so
as
to
evade
the
full
force
of
the
weapon
which
had
accordingly
somewhat
glanced
in
its
stroke
still
the
wound
although
not
instantly
fatal
bid
fair
to
prove
so
ere
long
and
montgomery
groaned
when
he
thought
of
his
inability
to
render
his
friend
skilled
assistance
when
he
saw
that
the
hemorrhage
still
continued
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
a
feeling
of
desperate
helplessness
seized
upon
him
and
his
eyes
scanned
the
land
to
see
whether
any
possible
help
was
within
sight
while
his
glance
was
turned
towards
the
prairie
a
boat
suddenly
collided
gently
with
his
own
and
to
his
amazement
he
found
a
powerful
indian
seated
in
a
birch
canoe
alongside
the
indian
made
a
cordial
yet
dignified
signal
of
friendship
and
almost
exhausted
his
english
vocabulary
with
his
greeting
do
in
despair
the
other
pointed
to
his
dying
companion
and
then
to
the
woods
beyond
indicating
that
the
murderer
had
fled
the
indian
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
and
paddling
to
the
shore
he
gathered
from
the
armless
socket
of
an
aged
live
oak
a
handful
of
webs
this
done
he
removed
the
other
bandages
and
placed
the
webs
against
the
wound
the
fine
clinging
meshes
of
the
webs
did
what
the
cloths
had
failed
to
do
and
the
terrible
bleeding
stopped
de
leon
opened
his
eyes
at
length
and
his
friend
rejoiced
to
see
that
he
was
sensible
and
as
yet
at
least
free
from
fever
come
here
to
me
faintly
whispered
the
wounded
man
after
looking
wistfully
at
george
montgomery
for
a
time
am
going
to
leave
you
george
and
his
voice
rested
tenderly
as
a
on
the

i
am
dying

want
to
tell
you
about
a
wrong

steadily
drooped
as
the
weeks
went
by
and
brought
no
sign
from
her
husband
in
reply
to
her
loving
message
and
when
at
length
she
received
the
letter
written
by
her
husband
on
leaving
the
monastery
its
utter
hopelessness
served
only
to
add
to
her
misery

to
further
undermine
her
health

poor
darling

for
the
winter
said
the
old
grandmother
to
her
husband
we
shall
lose
her
and
her
partner
sighed
acquiescence
for
alice
the
spring
of
her
life
seemed
broken
and
look
which
way
she
would
the
horizon
seemed
dark
and
hopeless
her
malady
showed
no
signs
of
improvement
he
went
about
pursued
by
a
thousand
phantasmal
monetary
cares
a
craze
of
his
brain
for
which
no
remedy
could
be
provided
and
which
was
only
kept
within
bounds
by
his
habit
of
spending
long
hours
daily
in
signing
imaginary
checks
in
payment
of
inextinguishable
loans
in
the
late
autumn
an
incident
happened
to
him
which
accomplished
what
his
medical
advisers
had
considered
to
be
impossible
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
while
hanging
a
picture
for
his
sister
one
day
the
on
which
he
stood
gave
way
and
precipitated
him
through
a
large
pane
of
thick
the
sharp
edges
of
the
glass
cut
his
face
and
neck
severely
and
the
result
was
a
most
terrible
and
alarming
hemorrhage
which
was
only
stopped
after
such
a
loss
of
blood
as
imperiled
for
a
time
the
life
this
loss
however
served
to
ease
and
finally
to
entirely
remove
the
pressure
upon
his
brain
resulting
from
his
bullet
wound
and
when
he
came
back
to
consciousness
from
the
long
fainting
spells
which
succeeded
the
loss
of
blood
he
inquired
feebly
of
his
sister
where
he
was
and
whether
she
knew
who
the
man
was
who
had
shot
him
his
life
from
the
moment
george
bullet
had
struck
him
until
now
was
a
complete
blank
when
alice
montgomery
learned
from
her
lips
what
had
taken
place
between
him
and
her
husband
on
the
night
of
the
quarrel
she
gentle
soul
had
no
blame
for
the
latter
although
she
loaded
herself
with
bitter
reproaches
poor
husband
what
he
have
thought
to
see
me
meeting
and
kissing
another
man
surreptitiously
when
he
believed
i
had
no
male
relative
living
excepting
the
one
in
this
house
her
letter
had
prepared
her
for
her
confession
but
the
details
as
furnished
by
the
latter
showed
that
the
crime
had
been
the
result
of
but
a
momentary
frenzy
of
jealousy
which
as
a
woman
she
could
readily
forgive
when
she
took
her
first
walk
out
of
doors
with
her
invalid
brother
the
last
shock
of
autumn
had
stripped
the
trees
and
covered
the
sward
with
a
dense
matting
of
leaves
which
the
colored
gardener
was
leisurely
removing
with
a
large
rake
for
a
while
the
two
stopped
to
speak
to
the
old
servitor
and
then
the
latter
resumed
his
work
suddenly
alice
sprang
with
a
cry
from
her
side
and
seized
the
rake
i
saw
something
flash
in
the
light
just
where
your
rake
softly
she
turned
over
the
crumpled
mass
and
there
at
last
lying
on
a
withered
chestnut
leaf
and
round
and
clear
as
the
first
day
it
was
made
lay
the
lost
on
that
fateful
morning
so
many
weary
months
ago
hidden
in
the
dense
green
of
the
turf
during
the
summer
season
it
had
become
exposed
by
the
withering
of
the
grass
only
to
be
presently
covered
by
the
falling
leaves
first
glancing
at
the
initials
and
date
cut
on
the
inside
of
the
hoop
to
see
that
there
was
no
chance
of
a
mistake
alice
pressed
the
ring
again
and
again
to
her
lips
cooing
and
murmuring
glad
words
of
love
to
herself
the
while
is
my
she
exclaimed
to
her
greatly
astonished
brother
i
lost
on
the
day
of
your
your
first
accident
and
all
my
trouble
i
am
sure
resulted
from
that
loss
now
its
recovery
seems
like
an
omen
of
good
luck
oh
i
wonder
where
on
the
face
of
the
world
my
dear
husband
is
i
want
to
send
him
a
message
to
tell
him
that
all
will
be
right
if
he
will
only
come
and
then
as
the
apparent
hopelessness
of
his
return
came
back
to
her
mind
the
bright
light
died
out
of
her
eyes
and
she
resumed
the
walk
with
her
brother
in
silence
at
the
same
hour
george
montgomery
learned
for
the
first
time
from
his
dying
lips
about
the
message
which
his
wife
had
sent
him
by
cable
back
all
is
he
had
no
words
of
reproach
for
the
man
who
had
atoned
for
the
harm
which
he
had
done
by
sacrificing
his
life
for
him
but
even
in
the
midst
of
his
great
and
happiness
he
groaned
to
think
what
dire
complications
the
want
of
a
reply
to
that
message
might
have
entailed
the
indian
had
towed
the
boat
to
the
shores
of
the
beautiful
lake
rosalie
in
whose
wonderful
hammocks
that
branch
of
the
seminole
tribe
which
still
clung
to
the
grand
mico
tallahassee
had
long
built
their
wigwams
the
indians
bore
the
wounded
man
gently
up
the
bluff
on
a
litter
and
laid
him
on
a
soft
couch
of
prepared
spanish
moss
or
old
beard
as
it
is
sometimes
called
over
the
sick
couch
a
great
live
oak
flung
its
protecting
shade
high
above
and
impermeable
to
either
sun
or
rain
on
all
sides
the
same
gigantic
trees
with
their
dense
evergreen
foliage
towered
to
the
skies
their
vast
limbs
festooned
with
the
long
draperies
of
the
flowing
spanish
moss
a
wide
open
space
lay
within
a
vast
forest
of
these
trees
the
space
was
large
enough
for
the
encampment
of
an
army
and
as
the
mighty
span
of
the
live
oak
branches
enabled
them
to
overlap
far
overhead
the
whole
looked
like
some
vast
cathedral
ornamented
with
delicate
fretwork
and
bathed
in
a
soft
and
appropriate
religious
gloom
to
the
left
of
the
wounded
man
lay
beautiful
lake
rosalie
across
whose
broad
bosom
a
refreshing
breeze
swept
which
fanned
his
fevered
brow
to
his
right
and
far
within
the
natural
retreat
stood
a
cluster
of
wigwams
in
whose
entrances
could
be
seen
groups
of
squaws
of
all
ages
curiously
regarding
the
new
arrivals
after
a
proper
interval
had
elapsed
the
aged
chief
tallahassee
came
forward
from
his
tent
to
greet
george
montgomery
the
chief
was
a
man
of
commanding
and
exceedingly
dignified
appearance
he
was
evidently
in
nowise
forgetful
of
the
glories
of
the
tribe
of
which
he
was
head
even
although
that
tribe
should
have
dwindled
down
to
a
mere
handful
the
braves
who
stood
by
his
side
were
men
of
gigantic
stature
and
the
czar
of
all
the
russias
owns
not
warrior
more
true
or
courtiers
more
obedient
or
of
superior
address
the
turbaned
heads
clear
aquiline
features
and
long
wavy
hair
served
to
distinguish
this
race
from
all
others
on
the
continent
of
america
beside
their
intellectual
faces
and
stalwart
frames
the
cunning
and
ferocious
apache
with
his
meaner
physique
shifty
eye
and
animal
profile
looked
as
the
hyena
looks
beside
the
lion
george
montgomery
despatched
a
letter
to
his
wife
availing
himself
of
the
services
of
an
indian
to
reach
the
nearest
postal
point
allowing
an
interval
of
ten
days
to
elapse
the
same
indian
returned
by
his
direction
for
a
reply
none
however
came
either
that
week
or
the
next
and
after
the
third
week
the
indian
went
back
no
more
and
the
gloom
returned
to
george
brow
he
would
fain
have
sped
northward
himself
to
investigate
the
cause
of
this
silence
but
his
dying
friend
still
lingered
and
as
his
end
drew
near
he
seemed
more
eagerly
to
crave
the
society
it
will
not
be
long
wait
and
close
my
eyes
and
say
a
christian
prayer
over
my
and
george
in
sore
trouble
waited
at
length
it
was
clear
that
the
end
was
at
hand
and
poor
de
leon
begged
his
friend
not
to
leave
his
side
that
day
as
george
sat
by
the
couch
his
ear
caught
now
and
then
the
utterances
of
delirium
of
his
dying
comrade
they
are
coming
and
will
soon
be
here
if
they
come
before
the
sun
sinks
behind
lake
rosalie
i
shall
die
then
he
slumbered
and
head
sank
on
his
breast
in
sad
and
heavy
meditation
they
are
coming
suddenly
cried
de
leon
rousing
from
his
stupor
and
startling
the
various
members
of
the
tribe
within
sound
george
glanced
anxiously
at
his
friend
who
was
now
struggling
to
a
sitting
position
and
pointing
across
the
lake
look
continued
the
dying
man
have
come
in
as
eyes
followed
the
hand
he
saw
far
in
the
distance
a
small
crossing
the
lake
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
then
sat
down
bitterly
adding
aloud
should
i
excite
myself
it
is
probably
a
party
of
an
hour
later
george
montgomery
and
alice
his
wife
stood
hand
in
hand
by
the
of
de
leon
and
the
dying
eyes
seemed
only
to
have
waited
for
this
for
when
they
saw
the
happy
reunion
they
smiled
a
last
benediction
and
then
closed
forever
the
meeting
between
husband
and
wife
inexpressible
as
it
was
in
words
was
a
profound
surprise
to
both
montgomery
had
gone
south
at
her
request
and
first
letter
was
still
following
her
during
their
stay
in
florida
the
old
lady
heard
that
chief
tallahassee
was
camped
near
lake
rosalie
and
she
conceived
the
brilliant
idea
of
visiting
her
former
friend
and
at
the
same
time
lending
some
additional
interest
to
her
life
with
some
difficulty
she
had
secured
the
use
of
a
small
with
what
result
the
reader
already
knows
tallahassee
and
two
of
his
braves
were
absent
when
the
boat
arrived
when
the
former
silently
entered
the
camp
rifle
in
hand
he
found
himself
suddenly
face
to
face
with
montgomery
and
the
elder
lady
as
he
saw
alice
a
wonderful
light
leapt
to
his
eyes
and
in
the
soft
seminole
tongue
he
murmured
is
the
come
back
and
he
stooped
and
kissed
the
fair
young
hand
which
hung
by
her
side
no
tallahassee
exclaimed
the
elder
lady
with
a
rising
mist
in
her
eyes
and
a
quiver
in
her
voice
which
showed
that
she
forgave
the
present
neglect
for
the
sake
of
the
old
and
faithful
memory
fade
as
even
great
warriors
fade
i
am
the
friend
whose
husband
you
saved
at
homosassa
and
this
new
is
my
tallahassee
recognized
his
error
and
his
eyes
had
a
soft
and
tender
light
in
them
as
he
scanned
the
aged
though
still
beautiful
lineaments
of
the
woman
he
had
known
and
loved
so
many
years
ago
then
he
gently
took
her
hand
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
saying
tenderly
as
he
did
so
blooms
afresh
every
spring
but
tallahassee
the
seminole
fades
and
that
night
as
the
moon
shone
on
the
waters
of
lake
rosalie
alice
explained
fully
what
had
only
been
whispered
when
they
met
her
brother
she
told
her
husband
had
recovered
and
no
one
save
themselves
knew
who
had
wounded
him
he
on
his
part
explained
that
some
one
else
had
received
the
message
she
had
sent
to
madrid
begging
him
to
return
but
the
name
of
the
man
who
had
received
it
he
did
not
divulge
so
that
in
mingling
her
tears
with
those
of
her
husband
over
de
lonely
grave
by
lake
rosalie
there
was
no
bitterness
from
the
thought
of
wrong
done
by
the
dead
as
george
replaced
on
his
hand
the
ring
which
had
been
lost
their
eyes
met
in
a
long
eloquent
glance
misty
with
happy
tears
will
take
good
care
not
to
take
it
off
again
darling
that
is
what
you
mean
is
it
not
for
i
am
sure
that
whatever
others
may
say
will
always
believe
that
it
is
very
unlucky
either
to
take
off
or
lose
the
legend
of
the
red
moss
rapids
this
the
spot
where
the
knight
of
the
old
legend
was
killed
rowell
dear
he
died
on
these
sharp
rocks
and
the
old
folks
living
around
here
who
remember
the
particulars
as
they
were
handed
down
through
long
generations
say
that
the
rocks
assumed
that
shape
and
the
moss
for
the
first
time
put
on
that
peculiar
blood
tint
after
the
murder
imagination
no
doubt
still
the
combination
is
certainly
a
very
weird
you
tell
me
the
legend
dear
while
we
sit
on
this
sloping
bank
but
first
of
all
let
me
ask
was
not
the
knight
who
was
killed
an
ancestor
of
yours
family
is
descended
from
his
brother
sir
gawain
erfert
whose
likeness
you
saw
in
the
picture
that
strange
knight
in
mail
with
his
hand
resting
on
the
cross
handle
of
his
sword
dear
he
was
the
real
founder
of
our
now
for
the
legend
dear
said
the
fair
hilda
a
beautiful
girl
of
nineteen
with
large
dark
sympathetic
eyes
and
a
smile
whose
brightness
lit
up
all
the
shaded
landscape
still
rowell
hesitated
and
his
naturally
serious
almost
sombre
air
took
on
more
than
a
touch
of
gloom
the
two
were
betrothed
lovers
and
their
wedding
was
fixed
for
the
following
june
their
engagement
had
suffered
from
none
of
the
vicissitudes
which
are
supposed
to
imperil
the
course
of
true
love
this
was
largely
owing
to
the
depth
of
their
mutual
attachment
but
it
was
also
due
in
no
small
degree
to
the
perfect
compatibility
of
their
natures
she
was
all
sweetness
and
gentleness
he
all
calmness
and
strength
with
apparently
none
of
the
usual
masculine
waywardness
which
is
more
prone
to
cloud
than
to
illuminate
the
horizon
am
waiting
sir
expostulated
the
gentle
hilda
nestling
much
closer
to
his
side
than
was
necessary
to
a
successful
hearing
you
really
want
to
hear
that
unhappy
legend
dear
replied
rowell
is
a
miserable
story
and
the
consequences
of
what
took
place
here
so
long
ago
have
left
a
poison
in
our
family
tree
which
has
showed
itself
in
every
generation
since
in
some
painful
way
ever
since
that
time
when
the
knight
templar
died
on
these
rocks
five
hundred
years
ago
some
wretched
blunder
like
an
echo
of
the
old
one
has
occurred
time
and
again
to
cloud
each
generation
with
misery
and
and
caused
the
family
to
be
known
throughout
the
whole
north
country
as
the
when
i
tell
you
the
story
which
is
shown
by
the
old
chronicles
to
be
a
dismally
true
one
in
every
detail
and
in
that
respect
different
from
many
other
border
legends
you
may
perhaps
not
care
to
become
a
member
of
such
an
house
the
risk
dear
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
considerable
and
the
smile
with
which
rowell
looked
into
the
eyes
of
his
had
infinitely
more
of
wistfulness
and
pathos
in
it
than
was
good
to
see
in
one
so
young
rowell
do
you
think
me
a
child
our
marriage
is
now
so
near
that
i
consider
myself
one
of
the
family
already
and
you
would
not
hide
my
own
secrets
from
me
would
you
to
rowell
the
warm
pressure
of
the
locked
hands
the
arch
lovelit
glance
and
the
magnetism
of
the
beautiful
at
his
side
were
irresistible
and
taking
the
dainty
head
between
his
hands
he
kissed
the
upturned
face
again
and
again
eyes
hair
lips
in
a
burst
of
passion
which
left
the
fair
cheeks
all
aglow
and
her
eyes
eloquent
with
a
struggle
between
rebellion
and
rapture
to
business
sir
if
you
have
got
over
your
outbreak
of
lunacy
resumed
the
still
blushing
hilda
as
she
regained
possession
of
herself
and
moved
with
much
pretence
of
distance
a
foot
away
rowell
seeing
there
was
no
escape
took
up
the
recital
of
the
legend
but
there
was
a
protest
in
his
tones
which
roused
a
look
of
remonstrance
in
his
listener
the
second
crusade
failed
began
rowell
the
surviving
english
knights
who
drifted
slowly
back
to
their
homes
across
europe
enfeebled
by
wounds
and
the
pestilential
climate
in
which
they
had
endured
such
untold
hardships
in
their
efforts
to
rescue
the
holy
city
from
the
infidel
there
was
a
knight
templar
who
for
special
valor
in
rescuing
the
person
of
the
preceptor
as
well
as
the
sacred
standard
of
his
order
after
their
capture
by
the
saracens
was
at
his
request
absolved
from
his
vows
of
celibacy
by
the
grand
master
meant
a
retirement
from
the
sacred
order
and
as
the
rules
recognized
no
form
of
withdrawal
or
absolution
from
its
vows
save
by
death
the
elaborate
ceremonial
customary
on
the
death
of
a
great
knight
was
observed
and
the
knight
templar
obtained
his
freedom
only
after
the
due
performance
of
his
funeral
obsequies
the
fame
and
position
of
these
knights
and
of
their
spiritual
order
was
so
great
that
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
any
knight
craving
release
explanation
of
the
strange
request
however
was
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
this
knight
after
taking
his
vows
had
met
and
had
fallen
hopelessly
in
love
with
a
beautiful
woman
the
lady
erminie
athelrade
and
the
love
was
fully
reciprocated
mutual
confession
of
attachment
had
taken
place
and
the
knight
left
with
the
apparently
hopeless
task
before
him
of
earning
absolution
from
his
vows
by
some
unparalleled
service
to
the
order
failing
success
and
fulfilment
of
their
desires
had
seemed
beyond
earthly
possibilities
their
only
hope
lay
in
some
future
reward
for
their
constancy
beyond
the
grave
for
the
knight
was
of
stainless
character
and
would
rather
have
suffered
death
a
thousand
times
at
the
hands
of
the
paynim
hosts
than
have
betrayed
his
vows
so
the
knight
had
left
england
for
the
holy
land
breathing
the
sentiment
which
found
voice
hundreds
of
years
later
could
not
love
thee
dear
so
much
loved
i
not
honor
will
now
understand
with
what
feelings
the
knight
now
no
longer
a
templar
but
simply
sir
julian
erfert
found
himself
wounded
and
it
is
true
but
still
alive
back
in
his
native
country
in
the
same
little
island
as
the
woman
he
worshipped
whose
image
glowing
in
his
heart
like
a
holy
flame
had
inspired
him
to
deeds
which
had
thrilled
christendom
and
beggared
all
knightly
possibilities
julian
i
ought
to
say
had
one
confidant
of
his
passion
his
elder
brother
sir
rowell
sir
julian
arrived
in
england
no
one
would
have
recognized
in
the
battered
knight
innocent
of
followers
the
former
princely
templar
whose
splendor
of
apparel
and
of
retinue
had
elicited
so
much
applause
when
he
left
to
join
the
crusaders
five
years
before
was
late
one
summer
afternoon
in
early
june
when
sir
julian
rode
up
to
the
castle
of
barronby
where
he
had
left
the
lady
erminie
in
the
care
of
her
guardian
the
earl
of
wolston
a
man
the
knight
now
recollected
with
a
chill
of
apprehension
notorious
for
his
grasping
and
ambitious
nature
julian
had
had
no
tidings
of
the
lady
since
he
had
left
and
he
had
sent
her
no
love
message
ever
mindful
of
the
fact
that
it
would
be
death
to
the
fair
reputation
of
any
dame
to
have
her
name
breathed
by
a
templar
or
to
have
it
known
that
she
was
interested
in
his
welfare
he
had
sent
her
word
of
the
accomplishment
of
his
release
but
whether
or
not
his
message
had
perished
by
the
way
in
those
perilous
times
he
could
not
tell
he
had
forwarded
a
letter
to
his
brother
too
and
so
there
he
was
at
last
under
the
shadow
of
castle
walls
with
his
heart
throbbing
as
it
had
never
beat
even
when
a
dozen
saracen
blades
were
at
his
throat
and
the
gleam
of
his
red
cross
banner
was
lost
among
the
tossing
crescents
of
the
infidel
host
he
gathered
rein
for
an
instant
in
an
open
glade
a
foot
soldier
unarmed
and
with
his
gone
tottered
into
the
opening
and
fell
with
a
moan
into
the
heavy
grass
on
seeing
this
strange
sight
the
knight
dismounted
and
stooped
over
the
soldier
who
was
evidently
badly
wounded
he
had
unlaced
the
fainting
jerkin
the
soldier
opened
his
eyes
and
seeing
sir
julian
strove
to
rise
while
his
hollow
voice
struggled
for
utterance
knight
go
tell
the
earl
the
lady
athelrade
has
been
carried
off
and
her
guard
many
and
which
way
did
they
go
briefly
inquired
the
knight
half
a
score
spearmen
and
a
knight
whose
crest
i
could
not
see
they
went
by
moss
on
the
umber
road
and
he
said
no
more
but
fell
back
dead
knight
gave
no
glance
to
the
castle
but
he
looked
to
his
saddle
girths
untied
the
mace
at
his
loosened
the
heavy
sword
in
its
sheath
and
swung
into
the
saddle
humming
softly
a
quaint
eastern
air
which
made
his
gallant
charger
crane
back
his
ears
to
hear
and
took
all
the
fatigue
out
of
his
weary
limbs
is
like
the
old
times
salado
said
the
knight
softly
to
his
arab
and
the
horse
leapt
at
the
words
knight
looked
young
again
is
as
my
soul
desired
to
win
her
at
the
point
heaven
is
good
and
here
is
moss
and
there
lies
the
umber
road
now
salado
an
hour
more
and
the
mivern
rapids
could
be
heard
a
few
minutes
later
and
the
glint
of
helmets
came
to
the
rider
through
the
trees
shall
catch
them
at
the
ford
salado
and
the
words
gave
new
life
to
the
willing
arab
who
came
of
a
fighting
race
and
to
whom
fighting
was
the
very
breath
of
life
to
one
salado
dare
we
venture
and
the
knight
laughed
softly
to
himself
and
the
flying
steed
shook
his
sides
as
if
he
too
chuckled
at
the
thought
minute
more
and
the
knight
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
abductors
who
hearing
pursuit
had
gathered
themselves
into
line
on
the
edge
of
the
ford
there
they
were
fully
half
a
score
and
a
knight
with
visor
down
and
without
a
crest
in
command
and
on
the
further
side
a
female
figure
on
horseback
being
hurried
on
in
advance
on
either
side
of
her
a
soldier
the
lady
shouted
the
knight
through
the
bars
of
his
visor
whom
came
back
the
haughty
inquiry
her
friend
and
earl
strange
knight
laughed
the
earl
he
said
lady
is
a
willing
fugitive
and
will
not
julian
made
no
response
but
salado
felt
the
touch
no
more
of
a
gilded
spur
and
shot
forward
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
the
were
stout
and
willing
but
three
of
them
fell
from
their
seats
like
dummies
before
the
whirl
of
that
demoniac
mace
and
the
gallant
arab
fought
no
less
willingly
and
mangled
the
opposing
steeds
the
odds
were
terrible
but
such
odds
were
familiar
and
the
solitary
warrior
was
not
without
his
chances
he
had
almost
cleared
a
path
and
even
in
the
frenzy
of
fight
his
brain
was
troubled
to
know
why
the
lady
made
no
sign
another
horseman
overthrown
and
he
stood
face
to
face
with
the
leader
exchanged
with
him
ringing
blows
which
could
be
heard
far
above
the
roar
of
the
rapids
on
whose
edge
they
fought
once
more
the
spur
touched
salado
and
the
mace
beat
down
the
guard
victory
was
in
sight
almost
when
alas
the
gallant
foot
sank
in
the
ooze
of
the
river
and
his
suddenly
arrested
movement
threw
horse
and
rider
into
the
shallow
torrent
sir
julian
struggled
to
extricate
himself
and
to
rise
to
his
feet
but
half
a
dozen
spears
hemmed
him
in
and
drank
his
blood
through
the
rifts
in
his
armor
made
by
the
pointed
rocks
the
struggle
of
his
horse
carried
him
beneath
the
current
the
surging
flood
filled
his
closed
casque
and
a
long
and
last
fell
in
his
native
land
on
the
knight
who
had
survived
all
the
dangers
of
the
terrible
crusade
no
at
least
not
yet
the
leader
knight
now
unhelmeted
directed
his
spearmen
to
raise
the
dying
knight
and
carry
him
to
shore
but
a
javelin
of
rock
between
his
held
him
fast
while
he
was
bleeding
to
death
from
spear
thrusts
his
helmet
was
unbarred
he
regained
the
consciousness
temporarily
lost
and
his
dying
eyes
wandered
from
the
faces
of
the
men
around
him
to
that
of
their
leader
the
sight
of
the
latter
seemed
to
trouble
him
and
he
strove
feebly
to
clear
his
eyes
from
the
spray
of
the
water
and
the
mist
of
approaching
death
brother
can
it
be
he
murmured
hoarsely
why
prolong
the
dismal
story
it
was
his
brother
sir
rowell
who
had
carried
out
the
abduction
of
the
lady
he
had
heard
that
the
earl
was
about
to
wed
the
lady
erminie
to
his
nephew
for
the
sake
of
her
lands
and
having
received
his
message
from
the
holy
land
and
communicated
its
contents
to
the
lady
an
abduction
was
arranged
as
the
only
possible
means
of
preventing
a
forced
marriage
he
had
intended
that
his
wife
the
lady
rowell
should
give
safe
sanctuary
to
erminie
until
julian
returned
when
the
two
lovers
should
be
united
knight
died
in
the
arms
of
the
lady
he
loved
her
lips
consoled
him
dying
for
disappointment
for
me
were
the
last
words
he
heard
on
earth
and
his
waiting
was
short
for
as
his
eyes
closed
in
death
she
drew
the
dagger
from
his
belt
and
with
it
liberated
her
own
soul
so
that
it
could
not
follow
but
accompany
him
they
were
buried
together
and
they
left
behind
them
the
saddest
man
in
all
the
world
my
ancestor
sir
rowell
whose
terrible
share
in
that
fatal
mistake
innocent
enough
in
all
conscience
has
left
all
his
descendants
a
heritage
of
penance
showing
that
nature
like
man
never
forgets
or
forgives
a
blunder
or
rather
that
she
fails
to
discriminate
between
a
crime
and
a
blunder
and
punishes
or
rewards
only
according
to
results
tragedy
of
the
rapids
has
been
repeated
in
our
family
time
and
again
down
through
the
intervening
centuries
not
as
tragedies
perhaps
but
as
unhappy
blunders
repetition
of
the
first
such
as
have
worked
untold
miseries
to
all
the
race
darling
that
i
have
told
you
the
true
legend
of
the
red
moss
rapids
do
you
still
wish
to
marry
into
so
dismal
a
family
yes
more
than
ever
before
it
was
simply
a
pleasure
now
it
is
also
a
what
way
dearest
that
is
my
secret
sir
only
to
be
revealed
on
our
wedding
day
but
tell
me
was
there
no
sequel
to
that
terrible
tragedy
my
ancestor
who
was
the
innocent
cause
of
the
slaying
of
sir
julian
said
on
his
that
in
the
far
distance
he
foresaw
a
time
when
the
shadow
consequent
on
his
fatal
error
would
be
lifted
from
our
house
but
it
would
only
happen
when
some
descendant
of
the
athelrade
family
who
should
be
ignorant
of
all
the
circumstances
had
of
her
own
free
will
revived
the
traditions
of
the
celebrated
order
of
the
templars
was
thought
that
grief
had
to
some
extent
crazed
the
old
brain
and
that
in
the
long
trances
which
he
was
subject
to
prior
to
his
death
his
burning
desire
to
right
the
wrong
he
had
inadvertently
done
which
had
grown
to
be
a
perfect
monomania
with
him
had
put
strange
fancies
into
his
head
and
that
as
he
imagined
the
misfortune
which
fell
on
our
house
had
come
through
the
slight
done
to
the
order
of
the
templars
by
his
retirement
from
it
even
under
proper
dispensation
he
grew
in
time
to
believe
that
peace
could
only
come
to
the
house
again
through
some
member
of
the
athelrade
family
lady
athelrade
being
the
person
who
so
to
speak
tempted
sir
julian
doing
what
i
have
me
remarked
the
fair
hilda
those
fine
old
knights
used
to
worry
about
things
just
fancy
any
soldier
of
the
present
day
distressing
himself
on
his
about
an
unlucky
accident
for
which
he
was
in
no
way
to
blame
and
torturing
his
last
moments
with
the
forecast
of
what
was
going
to
happen
three
hundred
years
it
does
seem
strange
returned
her
companion
these
knights
who
seemed
in
many
respects
so
much
more
cruel
and
bloodthirsty
than
men
of
the
present
day
should
yet
have
had
worries
and
anxieties
which
even
the
most
delicate
and
nervous
lady
of
the
nineteenth
century
would
despise
they
were
a
strange
medley
those
knights
of
old
steeping
europe
in
blood
for
a
mere
idea
and
dying
cheerfully
themselves
if
in
their
final
departure
they
could
but
kiss
a
lock
of
some
fair
creature
some
thousands
of
miles
away
whom
they
adored
oh
enthusiasm
is
a
great
an
immeasurably
great
force
tallyrand
says
de
zèle
point
de
but
his
cry
of
zeal
no
zeal
is
a
vast
mistake
i
think
maxim
may
be
all
right
for
statesmen
and
diplomatists
but
when
the
zealot
dies
from
off
the
earth
one
of
grandest
forces
will
you
dear
that
was
quite
an
interesting
little
homily
archly
ventured
hilda
as
she
wooed
her
lover
back
to
present
and
more
attractive
pursuits
by
placing
her
lovely
arms
round
his
neck
suppose
you
tell
me
my
hero
what
you
will
give
me
if
i
can
erase
all
that
dark
inky
stain
from
your
family
escutcheon
in
addition
to
providing
you
with
a
bride
i
am
afraid
it
is
not
to
be
done
what
you
term
the
ink
stain
has
been
there
too
long
my
little
sweetheart
who
can
not
find
acidity
enough
for
her
daily
life
and
is
imposed
upon
all
the
time
on
that
account
certainly
can
not
evolve
any
acid
strong
enough
to
clear
away
a
stain
which
has
grown
deeper
with
the
centuries
no
dearest
if
you
insist
upon
marrying
me
after
my
recent
disclosure
i
am
afraid
you
will
find
that
the
will
follow
us
and
that
our
union
will
be
indeed
for
woe
as
well
for
upon
you
sir
for
such
gloomy
thoughts
they
are
unworthy
of
my
future
husband
and
i
protest
against
them
yes
sir
in
this
way
and
her
rosy
lips
stole
upwards
to
his
after
a
fashion
that
effectually
erased
everything
but
paradise
from
his
mind
the
must
have
been
own
selection
the
morning
broke
bright
and
clear
with
that
dewy
freshness
in
the
air
only
to
be
found
in
merrie
england
the
bride
the
sun
shines
on
a
hundred
pair
of
loving
lips
murmured
in
joyous
congratulation
to
the
dainty
figure
crowned
with
orange
blossoms
surely
never
since
time
began
did
sound
so
merrily
and
so
sweetly
on
the
palpitating
air
as
on
that
morning
when
the
proud
and
happy
rowell
led
the
fair
hilda
from
the
altar
forgotten
were
all
ancestry
and
gloomy
legends
the
past
rolled
itself
up
hastily
and
convulsively
as
a
roll
of
musty
vellum
bounds
back
into
its
shape
and
only
the
happy
glorious
untranslateable
present
remained
words
of
gracious
congratulation
fell
in
showers
on
the
ears
of
the
blissful
pair
as
sweet
june
flowers
fell
beneath
their
feet
but
they
scarcely
heard
or
saw
so
much
greater
was
the
joyous
tumult
in
their
happy
blissful
hearts
my
darling
inquired
the
happy
husband
when
his
breath
had
come
back
to
him
and
they
were
seated
behind
a
pair
of
horses
on
their
way
to
the
railway
station
with
suspicious
traces
of
rice
still
visible
on
their
travelling
attire
noticed
you
signed
your
name
in
the
marriage
register
as
hilda
athelrade
erfert
of
temple
newsam
dearest
and
you
want
to
know
how
i
come
to
use
the
name
of
athelrade
well
dear
i
am
a
descendant
of
the
athelrade
family
and
o
my
darling
i
must
confess
something
else
now
i
am
also
the
owner
of
temple
newsam
the
innocent
restorer
of
the
tombs
of
the
knight
templars
foretold
by
your
ancestor
and
o
sweetheart
last
and
best
of
all
the
destroyer
of
your
family
curse
as
well
as
i
hope
the
founder
of
your
own
particular
and
individual
two
options
is
a
most
wretched
business
and
i
wish
i
were
well
out
of
as
these
words
fell
from
the
lips
his
strong
right
hand
smote
the
portals
in
front
of
him
and
heavy
glass
doors
swung
violently
back
in
response
to
the
vigor
of
his
touch
carried
away
by
the
force
of
his
feelings
he
swung
into
the
restaurant
with
the
full
vigor
of
his
mountain
stride
and
more
as
if
he
were
a
detective
in
expectation
of
surprising
a
gang
of
coiners
than
an
innocent
visitor
in
quest
of
congenial
society
and
wholesome
fare
to
speak
the
truth
douglas
gaskell
a
native
of
scotland
and
mining
expert
by
profession
thought
himself
in
very
hard
luck
indeed
this
bright
summer
evening
not
even
the
hum
of
cheerful
life
around
him
could
overcome
his
despondency
or
soften
the
bitter
reflections
which
gnawed
at
his
heart
and
as
he
reviewed
the
situation
later
on
under
the
soothing
influences
of
his
cigar
and
coffee
he
still
reassured
himself
that
he
had
most
excellent
grounds
for
repining
if
not
indeed
for
despairing
altogether
glancing
backward
a
few
months
he
saw
himself
returning
to
his
native
land
after
many
long
years
of
and
hardship
in
the
mining
districts
of
india
and
south
africa
with
enfeebled
health
a
few
hundred
pounds
a
good
reputation
for
honesty
in
a
business
of
some
temptations
and
a
ripe
experience
in
mining
matters
then
in
his
retrospect
amid
the
hum
of
cheerful
humanity
around
him
he
saw
the
fairest
face
in
scotland
smiling
on
him
he
saw
an
obdurate
old
scottish
laird
who
utterly
refused
to
let
his
daughter
be
engaged
to
a
mining
fellow
and
after
a
long
siege
by
soft
persistent
irresistible
arms
he
saw
the
grim
old
borderer
yield
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
he
gaskell
could
satisfy
him
before
he
started
for
norway
in
july
that
he
had
means
to
maintain
his
daughter
suitably
he
would
then
be
willing
to
consider
the
propriety
of
an
engagement
on
the
clear
mutual
understanding
however
that
gaskell
must
sheer
off
for
good
if
he
were
unable
to
satisfy
the
old
man
within
the
three
months
which
he
allowed
him
this
had
been
a
most
despairing
decision
to
the
mining
expert
who
termed
it
the
offer
of
option
on
the
woman
i
love
with
impossible
conditions
and
the
wreck
of
two
lives
as
a
but
madge
the
lady
of
his
affections
had
declared
everything
was
possible
of
achievement
to
true
love
within
three
months
and
how
his
stern
face
softened
as
he
recalled
the
bright
hopeful
loyal
look
with
which
she
had
dispatched
him
to
london
to
take
counsel
with
her
uncle
her
dead
favorite
brother
he
remembered
how
the
uncle
had
obtained
him
a
commission
to
examine
an
american
gold
mine
as
a
step
towards
finding
on
his
own
account
while
in
the
mining
districts
of
the
united
states
some
good
property
suitable
for
the
british
market
you
find
such
a
mine
he
had
said
will
do
my
best
to
place
it
for
you
and
you
can
honestly
add
to
its
price
as
discoverer
if
it
is
large
enough
and
provided
the
terms
on
which
you
obtain
the
control
will
justify
it
that
is
the
only
way
that
occurs
to
me
in
which
you
can
honestly
comply
with
the
old
absurd
conditions
within
the
the
face
of
the
silent
and
absorbed
man
grew
dark
as
he
recalled
how
in
the
execution
of
his
commission
he
had
arrived
in
new
york
only
to
learn
that
the
property
he
came
to
examine
had
been
withdrawn
from
the
market
the
fact
was
that
the
gentleman
who
had
offered
the
property
in
london
and
who
had
accompanied
him
across
the
ocean
to
introduce
him
to
the
proprietors
had
taken
his
measure
accurately
during
the
voyage
and
had
reported
to
his
colleagues
and
joint
owners
that
he
was
quite
satisfied
that
gaskell
could
not
be
tampered
with
but
would
insist
upon
making
a
thorough
examination
such
as
must
inevitably
disclose
the
worthlessness
of
the
property
the
owners
were
simply
a
gang
of
unscrupulous
adventurers
who
had
thought
to
avail
themselves
of
the
existing
craze
for
american
mining
properties
it
was
the
announcement
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
property
which
had
plunged
douglas
gaskell
into
the
depths
of
despondency
in
which
this
narrative
finds
him
as
his
retrospection
ended
he
sat
lost
in
thought
and
barely
conscious
of
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
gilded
youth
and
the
men
of
affairs
who
throng
in
numbers
he
was
all
unconsciously
being
very
closely
observed
by
three
gentlemen
seated
at
a
distant
table
oswald
who
had
accompanied
him
across
from
england
hector
marble
and
hamilton
gilbey
all
in
other
money
they
were
in
fact
the
owners
of
the
withdrawn
mine
gilbey
broke
the
silence
at
their
table
is
just
as
easy
to
make
a
large
haul
as
a
small
one
he
said
must
manage
to
fix
something
up
for
this
scotch
expert
who
is
sitting
over
there
looking
so
glum
he
is
disappointed
at
our
withdrawal
of
this
mine
and
is
i
imagine
ready
for
a
fresh
suggestion
now
i
have
been
casting
about
for
something
to
suit
him
and
i
think
i
have
discovered
it
at
the
three
drew
their
chairs
closer
together
than
strictly
honest
men
found
it
necessary
to
do
in
and
the
champagne
in
their
glasses
grew
flat
and
their
cigars
went
out
while
the
one
expounded
and
the
two
received
and
approved
one
of
the
choicest
plans
which
villainy
has
ever
concocted
in
connection
with
international
syndicate
or
corporate
business
the
proposition
laid
by
gilbey
before
his
colleagues
with
much
graphic
force
and
a
wealth
of
luminous
illustration
began
with
the
preamble
they
must
have
money
the
scotchman
sitting
near
by
suggested
a
means
of
getting
it
he
was
only
useful
in
connection
with
mines
he
could
not
be
fooled
as
to
the
quality
of
a
mine
therefore
he
must
be
fooled
in
some
other
way
as
they
could
not
promptly
get
the
control
of
any
honest
mine
on
terms
which
would
be
acceptable
to
the
syndicate
and
profitable
to
them
that
was
the
argument
and
it
was
considered
as
being
to
the
point
the
proposition
was
as
follows
gilbey
knew
of
a
mine
called
gold
in
california
which
had
at
one
time
embraced
a
great
number
of
claims
and
covered
quite
an
extent
of
territory
this
mine
became
quite
a
valuable
property
and
a
dispute
having
arisen
as
to
the
ownership
of
of
it
the
property
was
finally
divided
between
the
two
litigants
by
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
both
properties
retained
the
title
of
queen
and
openings
had
been
made
in
both
about
yards
apart
the
workings
in
one
mine
had
proved
enormously
successful
and
that
mine
could
not
be
purchased
the
other
had
resulted
in
failure
and
very
little
if
any
labor
was
now
being
expended
on
it
suggestion
was
that
the
mine
which
had
proved
a
failure
should
be
optioned
to
the
english
syndicate
and
that
while
its
survey
should
be
correctly
given
on
the
option
steps
should
be
taken
to
get
gaskell
to
examine
the
good
mine
under
the
belief
that
he
was
inspecting
the
one
optioned
to
his
syndicate
you
deceive
him
as
to
the
existence
of
paying
ore
in
a
mine
continued
gilbey
can
readily
confuse
him
as
to
the
identity
of
the
property
he
is
examining
more
especially
if
he
is
simply
a
mineralogist
and
not
a
surveyor
as
know
the
manager
of
the
now
in
operation
number
one
let
us
call
it
and
i
can
guarantee
that
he
will
see
this
business
through
if
we
divide
with
him
number
one
is
well
known
to
be
well
worth
a
large
sum
of
money
and
it
do
for
us
to
offer
the
other
property
at
less
than
half
a
million
the
owner
of
the
latter
is
willing
to
give
me
a
four
option
on
it
at
their
plans
being
matured
the
illustrious
pair
were
presently
introduced
to
gaskell
as
the
owners
of
the
mine
which
had
been
withdrawn
they
had
exerted
themselves
they
said
to
find
him
a
property
of
equal
promise
and
had
at
last
after
much
trouble
succeeded
in
obtaining
for
him
an
option
on
the
gaskell
had
notified
uncle
of
his
first
disappointment
by
cable
and
two
hours
after
meeting
partners
he
walked
across
madison
square
and
sent
another
cablegram
intimating
that
he
had
heard
of
another
property
and
was
about
to
go
west
to
examine
it
at
his
own
expense
two
days
later
gaskell
left
for
san
francisco
where
on
his
arrival
he
met
the
manager
of
the
no
who
had
received
a
telegram
from
gilbey
to
go
to
san
francisco
to
receive
an
important
letter
which
letter
he
had
carefully
read
and
very
cordially
approved
the
days
which
followed
had
many
anxious
moments
for
the
three
speculators
in
new
york
do
most
devoutly
hope
this
business
land
us
in
prison
murmured
the
less
courageous
marble
nonsense
we
have
not
made
any
incriminating
statement
in
but
you
forget
your
letter
to
the
manager
of
the
mine
that
show
conspiracy
is
all
right
was
airy
rejoinder
manager
is
under
my
the
way
continued
the
tranquil
gilbey
you
notice
that
gaskell
had
the
ninety
option
which
you
gave
him
made
to
himself
personally
and
not
as
representing
the
syndicate
replied
oswald
noticed
it
he
would
not
take
the
responsibility
of
spending
the
money
in
making
investigations
which
the
members
had
not
ordered
if
he
approves
the
property
he
will
recommend
it
to
his
a
soft
sweet
childlike
smile
crept
over
the
faces
of
the
precious
three
as
they
separated
a
fortnight
later
gilbey
presented
to
his
delighted
associates
the
following
dispatch
from
gaskell
dated
san
francisco
approve
of
the
mine
optioned
subject
to
some
amendment
in
price
and
start
east
when
gaskell
returned
to
new
york
he
said
he
had
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
mine
and
would
be
willing
to
accept
an
option
for
it
if
the
price
were
fixed
at
instead
of
double
that
sum
the
radical
curtailment
of
their
figures
somewhat
dampened
the
ardor
of
the
three
confederates
but
finally
the
price
was
fixed
at
cash
with
many
protests
on
the
part
of
marble
and
gilbey
oswald
had
throughout
taken
only
such
interest
in
the
matter
as
a
friend
might
manifest
his
name
did
not
occur
on
any
of
the
papers
given
gaskell
and
on
this
occasion
as
on
the
others
he
took
little
part
in
the
arrangements
in
due
time
the
purchase
money
was
paid
over
and
marble
gilbey
each
with
to
his
credit
decided
that
they
would
seize
the
opportunity
to
satisfy
a
ambition
to
explore
southern
america
not
in
the
least
they
were
careful
to
assure
the
cynical
oswald
because
they
were
fearful
as
to
what
view
the
cold
judicial
eye
of
the
law
might
take
of
their
action
in
connection
with
the
mine
they
had
sold
oswald
who
as
stated
had
purposely
kept
in
the
background
and
in
consequence
contented
himself
with
a
smaller
share
of
the
profits
remained
in
new
york
six
months
later
gilbey
and
marble
were
in
the
city
of
mexico
wearied
beyond
the
power
of
words
with
the
vaunted
charms
of
that
country
and
anxious
only
to
be
once
more
within
sight
of
new
york
many
a
time
they
echoed
the
sentiment
of
the
city
wanderer
at
which
we
smile
so
often
would
rather
be
a
on
broadway
than
a
king
anywhere
but
respite
was
at
hand
a
letter
to
oswald
making
apparently
casual
inquiry
as
to
whether
he
had
heard
anything
further
of
the
sale
elicited
the
following
characteristic
reply
you
are
cooping
yourselves
up
in
the
city
of
mexico
because
you
are
afraid
to
return
on
account
of
any
troublesome
developments
in
the
business
you
may
as
well
come
back
at
once
the
englishmen
have
not
discovered
their
blunder
and
i
do
not
think
they
ever
will
i
have
a
good
story
to
tell
you
which
is
worth
your
while
to
come
miles
to
hear
meet
me
at
dinner
on
the
usual
time
and
place
and
tell
you
the
story
no
place
like
home
within
three
hours
the
two
speculators
were
on
the
way
to
new
york
when
the
second
bottle
of
champagne
had
been
opened
at
dinner
the
host
lit
a
cigar
saying
he
supposed
they
were
dying
to
hear
his
story
the
lips
of
the
two
twitched
a
little
and
a
hardly
perceptible
pallor
indicated
a
passing
nervousness
the
scotchman
got
to
the
mine
oswald
began
manager
took
him
to
no
as
you
or
as
we
arranged
he
remained
under
ground
hours
the
manager
was
cautioned
not
to
lose
sight
of
him
for
a
moment
but
he
gave
in
after
hours
and
went
home
to
bed
as
the
scot
looked
like
spending
a
week
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
when
the
manager
returned
twelve
hours
later
he
found
gaskell
just
coming
to
the
surface
in
reply
to
his
inquiry
he
said
he
had
completed
his
investigation
and
would
take
some
rest
whether
this
was
merely
a
blind
to
put
the
manager
off
his
guard
or
whether
he
changed
his
mind
i
know
but
after
he
had
seen
the
other
descend
the
mine
and
had
had
some
breakfast
he
took
the
map
which
you
gave
him
out
of
his
valise
and
proceeded
very
carefully
to
compare
it
first
with
the
boundaries
of
the
no
mine
which
some
loafing
miner
pointed
out
to
him
at
his
request
and
then
with
the
map
of
the
same
mine
hanging
in
the
office
and
which
the
manager
had
stupidly
omitted
to
remove
nearly
as
can
be
computed
it
took
that
fellow
just
about
five
minutes
to
detect
the
trick
of
course
this
is
mere
for
the
man
himself
was
as
silent
as
a
clam
the
profundity
of
his
silence
when
he
unravelled
our
tangled
plots
aroused
my
admiration
he
learned
the
game
he
placidly
descended
mine
no
the
one
of
which
he
really
held
the
option
he
remained
in
that
mine
just
sixteen
hours
and
all
that
time
the
manager
concluded
he
was
in
bed
and
asleep
sure
i
know
why
except
on
the
assumption
that
a
man
must
sleep
sometime
the
assistance
of
an
old
mexican
miner
who
practically
lives
down
in
that
mine
in
one
of
the
shafts
he
thoroughly
explored
the
mine
more
especially
at
that
part
which
is
in
a
straight
line
with
the
rich
vein
of
no
had
to
all
appearances
some
queer
theory
about
that
vein
for
he
and
the
old
mexican
worked
for
more
than
twelve
hours
cutting
in
its
direction
the
result
of
these
efforts
was
it
was
ascertained
after
the
purchase
that
while
the
mexican
slept
gaskell
struck
a
continuation
of
the
vein
belonging
to
no
having
satisfied
himself
that
he
had
struck
the
true
vein
and
after
taking
out
several
specimens
of
the
ore
he
carefully
covered
up
his
awoke
the
old
man
and
returned
to
the
surface
will
understand
the
discovery
gaskell
had
made
when
i
tell
you
that
from
the
vein
in
no
to
where
it
was
identified
in
no
is
just
yards
of
which
run
through
the
land
of
no
so
that
of
the
great
vein
belong
to
the
mine
that
gaskell
bought
gentlemen
gaskell
sold
that
mine
to
his
syndicate
it
was
his
own
venture
for
half
cash
half
stock
and
his
syndicate
sold
it
to
the
public
for
the
new
company
has
already
taken
out
of
the
mine
in
four
working
with
the
prospect
of
taking
out
twenty
times
as
much
in
the
next
two
years
the
profit
of
taken
in
stock
is
now
worth
in
the
marble
and
his
associates
gazed
at
each
other
fixedly
for
a
minute
and
although
their
eyes
spoke
volumes
no
word
was
uttered
the
situation
was
altogether
too
deep
for
words
with
one
impulse
they
rose
in
grim
silence
from
the
table
find
the
air
in
this
room
suffocating
finally
ejaculated
gilbey
us
as
the
now
silent
trio
passed
into
the
vestibule
in
making
their
exit
to
fifth
avenue
oswald
shattered
his
preternatural
calm
by
ejaculating
jupiter
the
exclamation
was
not
surprising
for
there
coming
toward
them
was
gaskell
the
man
they
had
done
their
best
to
swindle
and
his
bride
the
beautiful
and
queenly
madge
for
a
moment
a
wavering
in
the
ranks
of
the
three
was
perceptible
and
just
the
suspicion
of
a
desire
to
stampede
but
the
expression
on
the
face
reassured
them
dear
he
said
addressing
his
wife
me
present
to
you
some
friends
of
mine
who
once
rendered
me
a
very
great
service
somewhat
inadvertently
it
is
a
faint
shiver
shook
the
three
nevertheless
a
genuine
service
they
helped
me
to
win
what
i
wanted
most
on
earth
and
his
eyes
rested
fondly
on
his
wife
gaskell
commented
to
her
husband
afterward
on
the
strange
shy
modesty
which
almost
prevented
the
three
gentlemen
from
meeting
her
gaze
and
his
smiling
reply
was
stand
the
battery
after
the
three
friends
had
escaped
into
the
street
from
the
to
them
terrible
situation
oswald
probably
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
wore
a
crestfallen
air
he
said
carries
too
many
guns
for
us
all
round
just
think
of
it
he
has
never
even
mentioned
to
her
the
to
put
it
mildly
somewhat
peculiar
part
we
took
in
the
mining
do
you
know
that
you
can
always
tell
by
the
expression
in
a
eyes
when
you
are
presented
to
her
how
her
husband
has
been
in
the
habit
of
speaking
about
you
to
her
i
would
rather
have
faced
a
revolver
than
those
great
gray
eyes
if
she
had
known
our
gaskell
has
taken
other
options
since
his
marriage
and
some
of
them
have
proved
very
valuable
but
he
never
expects
to
find
one
to
equal
that
marvellous
pair
by
which
he
won
both
fortune
and
bride
in
a
strange
story
infirmity
johnstone
what
a
name
mamma
there
is
a
great
want
of
tone
about
it
you
think
so
sure
i
hope
the
man
is
presentable
but
you
know
how
careless
and
unobservant
dick
the
speaker
maud
a
lovely
girl
of
some
twenty
summers
sat
pen
in
hand
and
with
her
pretty
brows
all
in
her
boudoir
scanning
the
list
of
names
of
intended
guests
of
ormsby
hall
during
the
ensuing
shooting
season
dear
replied
her
stately
and
abundant
mamma
in
a
tone
which
settled
the
matter
is
as
rich
as
crœsus
and
even
if
he
should
prove
eccentric
why
he
is
an
australian
and
you
know
everything
is
excused
in
a
especially
resumed
the
dame
after
a
brief
pause
and
with
more
than
her
usual
drawl
if
he
is
very
maud
was
too
young
for
an
argument
of
this
kind
to
have
any
weight
with
her
but
she
only
shrugged
her
shoulders
by
way
of
protest
and
presently
the
letter
of
invitation
for
the
twelfth
of
august
when
grouse
shooting
commenced
was
on
its
way
to
felix
johnstone
the
person
whose
name
set
the
dainty
teeth
on
edge
was
a
gentleman
of
some
forty
years
the
greater
part
of
whose
life
had
been
spent
at
the
antipodes
where
if
he
had
not
acquired
much
of
the
polish
demanded
by
polite
society
he
had
nevertheless
secured
a
goodly
supply
of
that
excellent
substitute
for
it
gold
when
felix
johnstone
reached
the
hall
in
response
to
the
invitation
he
found
that
the
bulk
of
the
other
visitors
had
already
arrived
and
to
a
great
extent
themselves
as
he
termed
it
that
is
to
say
that
the
males
and
females
had
for
the
most
part
settled
upon
their
friendships
for
the
period
of
their
stay
at
ormsby
hall
this
arrangement
left
the
late
arrival
somewhat
out
in
the
cold
it
is
true
that
his
friend
dick
did
his
best
to
make
him
feel
at
home
but
as
the
old
squire
colonel
was
somewhat
gouty
most
of
his
duties
as
host
devolved
upon
his
son
who
had
in
consequence
but
little
time
to
devote
to
any
particular
guest
said
johnstone
to
his
valet
the
morning
after
his
arrival
have
to
keep
me
posted
in
things
you
know
what
here
for
captain
fitzwaring
recommended
you
as
being
the
best
man
he
knew
and
dick
i
mean
the
captain
knows
a
good
man
if
anybody
sir
responded
jarvis
with
more
of
embarrassment
than
his
usually
immovable
face
was
wont
to
show
shall
you
wear
this
morning
sir
inquired
the
valet
as
if
anxious
to
turn
the
conversation
i
thought
a
frock
coat
and
that
pair
of
lavender
trousers
which
poole
sent
in
before
i
left
london
and
a
white
waistcoat
would
about
suit
this
kind
of
weather
and
the
style
of
society
hereabouts
these
and
of
course
patent
leather
it
could
hardly
have
happened
in
so
a
servant
and
yet
surely
it
was
the
ghost
of
a
smile
which
his
master
saw
flitting
across
face
what
is
it
jarvis
inquired
johnstone
sharply
these
do
sir
replied
the
valet
with
much
deference
gentlemen
wear
knickerbockers
and
lacing
boots
in
the
morning
when
they
are
going
shooting
i
thought
perhaps
this
velvet
jacket
and
these
corduroy
trousers
and
woollen
stockings
or
gaiters
these
great
coarse
things
why
i
was
better
dressed
than
that
in
the
still
noticing
a
certain
relentlessness
of
aspect
creeping
over
the
face
i
must
i
must
only
it
seems
to
me
that
a
great
fondness
here
for
showing
legs
sure
the
way
these
flunkies
aired
their
white
silk
stockings
and
great
calves
last
night
before
the
ladies
was
hardly
decent
by
the
way
jarvis
do
you
know
any
of
the
gentlemen
staying
here
if
you
do
just
fire
away
and
tell
me
all
about
them
while
dressing
myself
like
a
like
a
navvy
sir
granby
just
walking
across
the
lawn
he
is
a
celebrated
barrister
made
his
reputation
as
a
junior
counsel
in
the
tichborne
case
he
is
likely
to
get
a
judgeship
out
in
bombay
soon
they
say
the
gentleman
with
him
is
softleigh
editor
of
the
morning
whisper
a
very
fashionable
paper
that
swarthy
man
with
the
piercing
eyes
just
lighting
his
cigar
is
hugo
swinton
the
african
traveler
who
had
the
terrible
fight
with
the
great
gorilla
now
in
the
zoo
the
man
waiting
for
him
is
captain
bottomly
of
the
guards
who
reformed
the
british
square
when
the
soudanese
broke
it
at
somewhere
in
egypt
they
say
he
has
six
spear
wounds
in
his
i
say
lord
who
is
that
pompous
individual
dressed
in
black
the
one
with
the
clean
shaven
face
and
complexion
sir
is
the
bishop
of
oldchester
replied
jarvis
with
a
touch
of
remonstrance
in
his
tone
and
even
he
puts
his
chubby
old
calves
on
exhibition
is
he
going
shooting
too
sir
replied
jarvis
with
quite
an
air
as
if
there
were
limits
to
this
kind
of
thing
the
bishops
wear
black
tight
fitting
cloth
gaiters
it
is
their
episcopal
i
see
well
now
who
is
that
very
elegant
young
gentleman
with
the
cane
bowing
to
the
ladies
in
the
pony
carriage
is
a
elphinstone
howard
i
have
never
seen
him
before
but
they
tell
me
he
belongs
to
one
of
the
county
families
in
the
north
somewhere
he
is
not
very
well
acquainted
with
the
gentry
around
here
yet
as
he
has
been
brought
up
abroad
where
his
father
was
retrenching
he
saved
colonel
life
in
florence
by
stopping
a
horse
and
with
that
introduction
the
family
took
him
up
and
introduced
him
to
english
jarvis
all
of
these
men
seem
to
be
celebrated
for
something
excepting
myself
can
you
tell
me
how
such
a
person
as
i
am
comes
to
be
here
jarvis
did
not
like
to
tell
johnstone
that
his
great
wealth
was
his
recommendation
so
he
evaded
the
question
by
inquiring
which
of
his
guns
he
would
use
that
day
bother
the
guns
was
the
response
want
to
kill
anything
this
beautiful
morning
here
jarvis
quick
he
called
suddenly
from
the
window
is
that
lady
driving
the
ponies
sir
is
the
lady
evelyn
beeton
daughter
of
the
late
earl
of
she
very
poor
jarvis
inquired
johnstone
after
a
substantial
sigh
indicative
of
dampened
hopes
at
hearing
the
title
sir
she
is
reported
to
be
quite
wealthy
as
she
succeeded
to
the
old
property
excepting
the
estates
which
being
entailed
in
the
male
line
passed
to
his
sorry
to
hear
it
jarvis
deuced
sorry
for
that
is
the
only
woman
i
could
ever
have
loved
funny
thing
to
tell
you
it
but
then
you
are
in
a
way
my
confidential
adviser
in
this
strange
country
and
i
know
you
would
never
split
on
me
for
if
you
did
jarvis
i
would
break
your
blessed
neck
to
a
sir
replied
the
complaisant
jarvis
by
way
of
acknowledging
the
kind
intentions
sir
resumed
felix
johnstone
with
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
not
one
of
these
men
who
have
all
their
life
long
been
trailing
their
hearts
through
the
streets
and
highways
for
every
thoughtless
miss
to
trample
on
my
heart
is
a
virgin
field
to
be
harvested
only
by
one
woman
in
this
world
and
if
she
have
it
so
then
jarvis
the
grain
has
got
to
rot
on
the
ground
all
now
jarvis
there
is
something
about
the
voice
and
look
which
stirs
me
like
a
trumpet
i
sat
opposite
her
at
dinner
last
night
and
the
mistakes
i
made
in
consequence
are
something
awful
to
contemplate
you
see
jarvis
she
is
not
too
young
she
is
i
imagine
about
thirty
is
sir
respectfully
corrected
jarvis
closing
a
peerage
at
which
he
had
been
glancing
now
it
strikes
me
my
friend
retorted
his
master
with
a
flush
on
his
brow
you
are
infernally
precise
about
the
lady
evelyn
age
may
i
take
the
liberty
of
inquiring
sir
how
you
came
to
know
it
exactly
just
to
a
hair
as
it
were
there
was
fire
in
the
eye
but
the
valet
answered
with
stoical
calm
age
is
in
the
peerage
sir
i
thought
it
might
interest
you
to
the
answer
was
mollifying
but
the
little
outburst
called
for
a
lull
in
the
conversation
and
johnstone
now
fully
dressed
stood
in
silence
looking
out
at
the
window
while
the
valet
busied
himself
about
his
effects
with
unruffled
brow
has
such
a
and
refined
air
and
such
a
soft
and
musical
voice
and
her
eyes
what
wonderful
color
and
expression
and
then
the
figure
so
graceful
and
yet
so
rounded
she
ought
to
be
a
queen
and
there
only
a
common
australian
squatter
and
such
was
the
murmuring
monotone
which
rolled
musically
from
the
massive
throat
of
felix
johnstone
by
the
window
consumed
he
suddenly
shouted
that
jackanapes
howard
got
into
the
pony
chaise
beside
her
my
hat
jarvis
quick
but
soon
he
reined
his
pace
all
it
is
no
business
of
mine
he
resumed
what
could
an
uncultivated
clod
like
me
have
in
common
with
a
noble
refined
lady
like
that
now
if
she
were
only
poor
or
in
need
of
a
friend
and
warming
to
his
work
danger
of
her
life
there
would
be
some
show
for
me
but
as
it
is
my
case
is
simply
hopeless
with
which
moody
reflections
johnstone
slowly
wended
his
way
downstairs
to
a
late
breakfast
he
found
miss
maud
the
daughter
of
the
house
presiding
at
the
breakfast
table
with
that
radiant
look
and
well
groomed
air
peculiar
to
english
country
girls
and
by
and
by
when
they
were
left
alone
he
managed
to
turn
the
conversation
to
the
object
of
his
adoration
think
all
the
world
of
her
remarked
his
companion
is
one
of
true
she
gave
up
the
best
years
of
her
life
to
her
invalid
father
and
now
i
suppose
she
will
never
it
seems
to
me
quickly
replied
johnstone
young
fellow
howard
is
paying
her
marked
attention
and
he
is
quite
young
and
very
this
sentence
bore
so
dismal
a
tone
that
miss
maud
looked
up
and
after
regarding
the
speaker
with
a
demure
glance
she
arose
from
the
table
simultaneously
with
her
and
thereby
terminated
the
morning
meal
as
she
saw
johnstone
standing
on
the
steps
a
few
minutes
later
in
a
listless
attitude
uncommon
in
so
stalwart
and
a
figure
she
remarked
to
herself
so
you
are
caught
my
handsome
but
unsophisticated
that
evening
at
dinner
an
accident
occurred
which
for
a
time
assumed
the
dimensions
of
a
calamity
colonel
it
must
be
stated
was
lord
lieutenant
of
the
county
in
which
he
lived
and
although
he
bore
no
title
he
occupied
a
position
and
lived
in
a
style
unsurpassed
by
any
titled
magnate
within
a
hundred
miles
dinners
at
the
hall
under
his
assumed
the
importance
of
state
festivals
and
the
order
of
procedence
was
as
carefully
observed
as
at
any
court
ceremony
at
eight
when
the
stately
doors
were
thrown
wide
open
it
was
accordingly
a
brilliant
procession
which
colonel
fitzwaring
albeit
still
somewhat
shaky
from
the
gout
headed
with
the
worthy
lady
on
his
arm
penelope
broadbent
was
proud
of
her
revered
husband
and
she
was
subject
to
no
deductions
proud
also
of
herself
she
was
a
lady
of
magnificent
quantities
and
if
none
of
her
numerous
admirers
used
the
word
in
describing
her
it
was
probably
because
her
wealth
of
proportion
was
other
than
perpendicular
if
a
great
and
artistic
photographer
had
had
to
choose
as
to
the
best
means
of
getting
a
really
accurate
and
comprehensive
likeness
of
penelope
broadbent
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
decided
on
a
view
as
having
many
points
of
advantage
the
lady
although
of
somewhat
ardent
complexion
affected
the
most
delicate
conceivable
shades
of
dress
probably
by
the
way
of
contrast
the
latter
was
certainly
sufficiently
startling
on
this
particular
evening
the
dress
which
sheltered
and
adorned
without
qualifying
the
tropical
of
the
greater
half
was
a
delicate
primrose
satin
and
it
shimmered
and
billowed
in
the
softened
light
like
waves
of
embodied
chastity
while
above
it
rose
and
fell
a
tossing
wave
of
glittering
jewels
the
broadbent
historic
gems
the
envy
it
was
said
of
royalty
itself
the
lady
as
became
her
rank
sat
at
the
right
hand
of
the
host
while
her
benign
and
dignified
lord
sat
next
to
the
hostess
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
how
it
came
about
will
probably
never
be
known
with
absolute
accuracy
but
just
as
a
staid
and
dignified
footman
was
about
to
hand
a
plate
of
turtle
soup
to
broadbent
the
gentleman
on
her
right
our
friend
felix
johnstone
was
observed
to
be
searching
wildly
for
his
handkerchief
alas
unfamiliarity
with
the
geography
of
pockets
in
dress
clothes
and
a
hazy
recollection
that
a
table
napkin
should
never
be
placed
to
the
nose
and
the
result
was
that
sneeze
a
thing
known
and
dreaded
along
a
hundred
miles
of
australian
coast
burst
upon
the
like
the
crack
of
doom
so
weird
so
awful
so
unspeakable
and
a
sneeze
had
surely
never
been
heard
since
the
world
began
the
footman
on
left
utterly
demoralized
dropped
his
plate
of
soup
where
he
stood
by
the
chair
of
the
wife
and
the
contents
rich
dark
tenacious
fell
on
the
ripe
warm
shoulders
of
the
shrieking
victim
and
rolled
in
an
oily
river
down
the
palpitating
outraged
bosom
and
all
athwart
the
delicate
primrose
tinted
garment
the
scene
now
beggared
description
felix
johnstone
also
bespattered
by
the
munificence
for
which
he
was
devoutly
grateful
as
it
gave
him
an
excuse
for
leaving
the
table
walked
to
the
door
as
if
he
expected
to
be
hanged
outside
as
he
bowed
himself
out
with
a
calm
born
of
the
supremest
desperation
three
glances
were
daguerreotyped
on
his
brain
the
flaming
visage
of
the
bishop
burning
with
a
look
of
very
unapostolic
rage
the
amused
and
cynical
smile
of
elphinstone
howard
seen
you
before
where
flashed
the
thought
and
inquiry
through
the
unhappy
brain
and
last
a
look
of
distress
and
commiseration
directed
toward
him
by
lady
evelyn
that
last
glance
was
one
of
resuscitation
in
its
effects
and
was
painful
as
such
always
are
the
pity
of
it
the
unhappy
man
murmured
for
this
awful
occurrence
she
might
have
grown
to
care
for
me
but
no
woman
ever
forgave
a
man
for
making
himself
so
he
shouted
as
he
entered
his
rooms
me
railway
sir
i
see
you
have
had
an
accident
you
change
your
clothes
sir
before
you
return
to
the
you
are
an
idiot
do
i
look
like
a
man
who
is
about
to
return
to
a
i
want
you
to
find
me
the
earliest
train
that
starts
for
the
north
pole
and
if
you
catch
it
catch
something
else
that
i
can
promise
jarvis
was
a
discreet
servant
of
vast
experience
and
the
train
which
he
did
look
up
found
its
terminus
in
euston
square
london
is
no
train
sir
was
all
he
said
as
he
closed
his
bradshaw
an
hour
later
dick
the
son
and
heir
of
the
family
entered
his
room
and
after
carefully
closing
the
door
and
seeing
jarvis
out
of
the
way
he
sat
down
opposite
his
friend
and
gave
himself
up
to
great
and
unrestrained
laughter
laughing
until
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
and
until
he
rolled
off
his
chair
through
weakness
sight
of
that
old
girl
he
exclaimed
irreverently
between
his
paroxysms
last
me
till
i
die
she
was
clothed
with
soup
as
with
a
garment
and
had
more
on
than
i
ever
saw
her
wear
before
at
table
by
jove
johnstone
you
have
rendered
yourself
right
old
man
laugh
your
fill
but
all
the
same
the
thing
has
done
for
me
i
shall
leave
here
in
the
look
here
returned
dick
with
an
approach
to
gravity
in
his
manner
is
precisely
the
very
thing
you
must
not
do
my
brain
is
small
but
what
there
is
of
it
is
clear
and
i
know
just
what
is
going
to
happen
by
morning
every
one
concerned
in
the
accident
and
most
of
all
the
bishop
and
his
wife
will
be
anxious
to
have
the
whole
thing
forgotten
and
everything
placed
on
its
old
footing
that
is
their
only
chance
of
escaping
being
made
the
of
every
county
meeting
within
a
hundred
miles
fancy
getting
wind
that
you
had
run
away
because
you
had
been
the
means
of
having
the
wife
smothered
with
turtle
soup
while
in
a
very
condition
why
people
would
say
it
was
judgment
on
the
exuberant
old
dame
no
old
chap
stay
where
you
are
and
guarantee
you
absolution
both
from
bishop
and
the
other
sat
in
silence
for
a
while
and
presently
dick
continued
the
way
if
it
is
not
too
delicate
a
question
was
there
any
special
cause
for
that
unique
sneeze
and
is
that
about
your
usual
figure
the
other
winced
for
a
moment
and
then
slowly
answered
sneeze
is
my
infirmity
but
it
does
not
spring
from
a
cold
ever
since
my
earliest
recollection
the
smell
of
musk
has
caused
me
to
sneeze
in
just
that
way
and
i
noticed
the
scent
of
that
perfume
at
table
just
before
the
attack
came
on
i
was
told
in
australia
that
a
very
slight
operation
on
the
nostril
if
skillfully
performed
would
cure
the
tendency
to
sneeze
and
i
thought
i
would
try
some
specialist
in
london
but
it
is
so
long
since
i
had
one
of
the
spasms
that
i
imagined
i
was
outgrowing
reception
the
following
day
bore
out
his
prophecy
the
bishop
and
his
wife
were
cordial
in
the
extreme
and
by
common
consent
the
unwelcome
subject
was
tabooed
indeed
the
affair
was
overshadowed
by
an
occurrence
of
a
much
more
serious
character
jewels
to
which
reference
has
already
been
made
were
discovered
to
have
been
stolen
during
the
night
the
shock
which
followed
the
announcement
was
intensified
by
the
discovery
that
other
jewels
were
missing
the
stolen
gems
had
been
locked
in
a
despatch
box
which
was
kept
in
the
adjoining
the
bedroom
and
in
the
morning
the
box
was
found
open
and
rifled
of
its
contents
as
the
diamonds
taken
were
of
immense
value
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
send
to
scotland
yard
for
a
london
detective
and
a
telegram
had
been
received
promising
the
arrival
of
the
detective
the
following
morning
in
the
closer
companionship
which
crime
always
induces
among
the
innocent
within
its
orbit
felix
johnstone
found
opportunities
of
conversation
with
the
lady
evelyn
beeton
and
it
is
a
pleasure
to
note
that
the
lady
found
many
solid
attractions
in
the
colonist
he
was
different
from
the
men
of
her
acquaintance
more
natural
more
manly
less
frivolous
in
a
word
altogether
more
acceptable
as
a
companion
than
her
more
polished
friends
in
the
result
our
hero
sought
his
couch
that
night
with
very
different
feelings
from
those
with
which
he
had
encountered
it
the
previous
night
the
north
pole
sir
jarvis
had
inquired
and
his
reply
was
if
you
mention
that
vegetable
or
mineral
again
lose
your
place
you
leave
that
pole
alone
and
presently
he
slept
the
sleep
of
the
just
it
was
probably
when
the
door
of
felix
bedroom
opened
softly
and
a
male
figure
stole
in
on
tiptoe
the
light
burned
low
in
a
night
lamp
but
that
did
not
embarrass
the
intruder
who
carried
a
dark
lantern
of
his
own
the
face
was
turned
from
the
door
and
his
breathing
was
deep
and
regular
poising
himself
on
his
tiptoes
as
if
ready
either
to
advance
or
fly
the
intruder
paused
for
a
moment
and
regarded
the
sleeper
attentively
apparently
the
scrutiny
was
satisfactory
for
the
burglar
now
advanced
noiselessly
in
his
list
slippers
to
a
stout
portmanteau
and
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
lock
he
murmured
know
him
of
old
he
always
carries
heaps
of
money
with
the
better
to
facilitate
his
operations
he
laid
a
jewelry
case
which
he
was
carrying
in
his
hand
on
the
while
he
took
a
bunch
of
skeleton
keys
from
his
pocket
with
the
keys
a
cambric
handkerchief
was
drawn
out
and
instantly
the
room
was
filled
with
a
pungent
odor
of
musk
the
subdued
jingle
of
the
keys
or
some
other
influence
troubled
the
sleeper
who
moved
uneasily
warily
the
burglar
stooped
over
him
with
the
aromatic
handkerchief
which
he
had
just
picked
up
in
his
hand
instantly
the
closed
eyes
opened
wide
and
ere
the
burglar
could
even
move
his
hand
there
burst
on
the
silence
of
the
night
that
stupendous
and
unearthly
sneeze
it
had
seemed
terrible
beyond
measure
in
the
crowded
noisy
room
but
here
in
the
midnight
silence
its
intensity
and
immensity
baffled
all
description
instantly
johnstone
now
fully
awake
bounded
to
his
feet
and
being
nearer
to
the
door
than
the
burglar
he
shut
and
locked
it
and
turned
to
confront
the
intruder
who
in
his
affright
and
surprise
had
turned
the
light
of
his
dark
lantern
on
the
room
and
on
himself
exclaimed
the
astonished
australian
who
recognized
in
the
man
before
him
not
only
the
elegant
howard
elphinstone
whose
face
had
puzzled
him
long
but
also
red
winthrop
a
notorious
melbourne
burglar
whom
he
had
once
been
the
means
of
for
a
term
of
years
you
think
you
have
tempted
your
luck
once
too
often
red
winthrop
inquired
johnstone
grimly
as
he
faced
the
other
with
the
bed
between
them
the
eyes
gave
a
dangerous
gleam
but
he
said
nothing
he
only
shook
his
wrist
sharply
and
a
long
lay
in
his
palm
but
for
an
instant
however
the
next
moment
it
flew
with
unerring
aim
at
the
throat
perhaps
johnstone
should
have
been
more
on
his
guard
still
his
quick
eye
noted
the
danger
although
not
in
time
altogether
to
avert
it
the
willing
blade
hewed
a
deep
rut
along
the
side
of
the
jaw
missing
the
jugular
vein
by
a
breadth
and
passing
on
went
straight
through
a
pier
glass
and
stuck
quivering
in
the
wood
at
the
back
of
the
glass
as
the
latter
shivered
johnstone
unmindful
of
his
wound
called
out
bad
luck
for
you
winthrop
and
vaulting
across
the
bed
he
closed
with
the
whom
after
a
short
but
sharp
struggle
he
succeeded
in
tying
hands
and
feet
meanwhile
the
whole
household
aroused
by
the
unearthly
noise
was
pounding
at
the
door
when
the
latter
was
opened
a
combined
scream
burst
from
the
assembled
guests
johnstone
was
standing
over
the
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
which
stained
the
white
and
even
the
walls
of
the
room
little
more
will
suffice
the
casket
left
on
table
contained
the
lady
diamonds
stolen
that
night
in
the
rooms
were
found
jewels
intact
and
also
those
stolen
from
the
other
visitors
johnstone
was
in
danger
for
some
time
from
the
excessive
loss
of
blood
and
when
finally
he
managed
to
leave
his
room
he
did
so
not
only
to
find
himself
a
general
hero
to
all
the
folks
at
the
hall
but
a
very
especial
and
particular
kind
of
a
hero
to
a
certain
lady
evelyn
beeton
when
in
process
of
time
the
mutual
admiration
between
these
two
was
crystallized
in
a
happy
union
the
worthy
bishop
tied
the
knot
with
an
unction
as
ripe
and
gracious
as
ever
the
church
sanctioned
while
madame
beamed
on
the
alliance
with
a
radiant
effulgence
which
eclipsed
and
dwarfed
all
the
surrounding
objects
shortly
after
the
recovery
of
our
australian
friend
he
testified
against
red
winthrop
and
as
that
talented
gentleman
received
his
sentence
of
seven
transportation
johnstone
dryly
remarked
break
winthrop
i
told
you
it
meant
seven
bad
it
is
only
right
to
add
that
although
our
friend
the
australian
had
sneezed
himself
back
into
favor
after
sneezing
himself
out
of
it
he
rightly
felt
that
so
fateful
a
blast
was
a
dangerous
and
uncertain
possession
and
after
a
time
he
took
competent
advice
on
the
subject
with
the
result
that
he
now
no
longer
dreads
the
musk
odor
which
used
to
be
his
two
christmas
eves
the
swirling
eddying
wind
drove
with
a
silent
ghostly
fury
up
the
deserted
high
street
of
upper
medlock
one
evening
in
carrying
with
it
into
every
crevice
and
corner
in
its
wild
pirouette
great
waves
of
heavy
snowflakes
what
lovely
weather
for
christmas
time
exclaimed
cargill
as
she
stood
by
her
side
looking
out
of
the
deep
broad
comfortable
of
their
house
on
the
rioting
tempest
in
white
outside
you
know
she
continued
nestling
so
close
to
her
side
that
he
had
to
put
his
arm
round
her
dainty
little
waist
to
maintain
his
equilibrium
you
know
that
a
storm
like
this
makes
me
think
our
new
home
doubly
comfortable
and
beautiful
you
see
it
is
the
first
real
home
that
i
was
ever
able
to
call
my
very
own
or
yours
dear
which
is
quite
the
same
thing
is
it
not
and
she
looked
up
into
her
face
with
bright
happy
eyes
by
way
of
reply
her
husband
imprinted
a
warm
kiss
on
the
tempting
lips
so
near
to
his
own
and
his
arm
tightened
lovingly
round
the
slender
form
shame
sir
kissing
me
at
the
window
sure
strangely
over
the
way
at
the
banks
saw
you
it
is
too
public
even
in
a
but
the
husband
dropped
the
arm
which
imprisoned
her
waist
and
turned
from
the
window
with
a
sigh
which
only
a
strong
effort
kept
from
changing
into
a
groan
of
despair
exclaimed
the
anxious
voice
of
his
wife
as
she
heard
the
sigh
is
something
wrong
with
you
tell
me
what
it
is
dear
there
is
nothing
wrong
i
was
standing
in
an
awkward
position
that
was
all
and
with
this
fiction
the
husband
stroked
his
glossy
brown
hair
and
looked
tenderly
into
her
eyes
but
there
was
a
shade
of
wistfulness
in
his
own
which
the
keen
gaze
noted
with
apprehension
and
with
womanly
persistence
she
pressed
her
point
at
last
and
not
altogether
unwillingly
for
the
load
was
a
heavy
one
for
a
single
heart
to
bear
the
husband
unbosomed
his
trouble
as
half
an
hour
later
they
sat
round
the
bright
fire
with
the
bleak
storm
barred
and
curtained
out
remember
he
began
your
rejected
admirer
banker
strangely
returned
good
for
evil
as
we
thought
by
giving
me
an
opportunity
of
going
into
the
longfellow
mining
deal
with
him
by
which
he
said
we
both
would
make
an
enormous
cargill
nodded
her
head
by
way
of
reply
but
kept
silent
her
wit
already
saw
trouble
ahead
but
she
anticipated
it
by
no
word
her
husband
resumed
advised
me
not
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
banker
or
his
scheme
and
dear
you
were
so
positive
about
it
that
when
strangely
me
by
explaining
that
your
objection
arose
only
from
a
dislike
to
him
i
felt
averse
to
confessing
what
i
had
done
until
the
money
should
have
been
made
and
i
could
bring
it
in
my
hand
to
you
you
will
recollect
dear
almost
pleaded
the
husband
by
way
of
excuse
as
he
looked
into
the
loving
patient
eyes
before
him
were
not
very
well
off
and
with
a
moist
tenderness
in
his
eyes
wanted
so
badly
to
have
a
pretty
cage
for
the
bonny
bird
i
had
just
the
hand
on
his
own
pressed
it
gently
and
there
was
a
soft
mist
rising
in
the
corner
of
the
brown
eyes
but
the
mouth
was
set
and
firm
me
the
words
fell
from
her
lips
and
they
almost
startled
the
husband
they
sounded
so
unlike
her
usual
soft
notes
resumed
the
husband
almost
desperately
sum
i
was
to
put
in
was
which
was
just
more
than
i
could
command
at
the
time
i
told
strangely
that
and
he
said
he
would
let
me
have
the
other
on
my
note
of
hand
which
he
said
could
be
paid
out
of
the
profits
of
the
mine
which
was
then
doing
remarkably
well
i
hesitated
about
giving
the
note
but
strangely
showed
me
a
letter
from
the
owner
of
the
mine
a
man
named
george
williams
of
denver
which
stated
that
the
preceding
profit
had
been
nett
and
he
thought
that
figure
would
be
maintained
and
considerably
increased
well
if
that
was
true
and
strangely
vouched
for
honesty
i
could
easily
meet
the
note
which
he
asked
me
to
give
out
of
the
profits
more
especially
as
the
banker
said
he
would
agree
to
let
all
the
profits
be
put
aside
for
that
purpose
and
would
not
himself
draw
anything
until
the
note
i
was
asked
to
give
was
paid
same
letter
of
williams
which
i
speak
of
showed
me
that
since
strangely
had
paid
down
to
bind
the
purchase
he
williams
had
received
an
offer
of
for
the
mine
which
was
more
than
we
were
going
to
pay
for
it
to
cut
a
long
and
miserable
story
short
i
gave
the
banker
my
note
six
months
ago
and
the
purchase
of
the
mine
was
completed
i
contributing
and
strangely
paying
since
that
time
we
have
had
the
hardest
kind
of
luck
with
the
mine
first
of
all
the
manager
left
then
the
mine
was
flooded
then
some
of
the
wooden
supports
gave
way
and
one
of
the
shafts
was
closed
and
the
end
of
it
all
is
that
we
have
not
received
a
single
cent
from
the
mine
since
we
took
it
over
and
my
note
for
is
due
and
all
the
money
i
have
or
can
control
is
was
there
ever
such
hard
luck
for
a
time
the
two
sat
in
silence
hand
in
hand
he
just
a
little
bit
averse
to
forcing
a
premature
expression
she
with
her
soft
velvety
eyes
staring
unseeingly
into
the
blazing
coals
miles
deep
in
thought
presently
she
spoke
and
her
voice
was
sweet
and
even
but
there
was
an
icy
air
about
it
as
if
the
breath
which
uttered
it
partook
of
the
chill
of
the
dismal
night
outside
strangely
he
enable
you
to
meet
that
note
or
let
it
stand
over
or
renew
it
there
was
a
suspicion
of
contempt
in
the
last
words
but
not
contempt
for
the
person
she
was
addressing
dear
strangely
has
been
telling
me
all
the
month
that
he
is
very
short
himself
and
that
his
directors
will
insist
on
the
note
being
paid
when
due
he
says
that
they
have
made
some
losses
lately
and
are
in
quite
a
bad
mood
over
dear
but
if
you
meet
the
note
what
will
they
do
then
will
protest
my
note
get
a
judgment
against
me
and
sell
my
property
this
house
our
home
almost
screamed
his
wife
as
she
sprang
to
her
feet
her
indignant
eyes
all
ablaze
and
giving
back
flame
for
flame
with
the
leaping
fire
darling
murmured
the
weary
man
down
even
to
the
but
they
do
it
replied
the
wife
her
bright
head
high
in
the
air
and
her
eyes
full
of
a
lovely
defiance
she
resumed
with
a
pitiful
attempt
at
a
cheery
smile
can
not
sell
can
they
sweetheart
replied
ben
with
a
duplicate
of
the
same
wintery
heartbreaking
mirth
in
his
tone
never
mind
my
darling
love
will
find
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
my
poor
poor
dear
to
think
that
you
have
been
bearing
this
burden
all
alone
for
these
long
miserable
months
while
i
was
so
blindly
so
foolishly
happy
and
oh
me
to
think
of
a
note
falling
due
on
christmas
eve
that
must
have
been
doing
that
to
spoil
our
christmas
now
it
dear
i
tried
to
put
it
off
till
january
but
he
said
he
could
not
make
the
note
for
more
than
six
months
although
he
could
renew
it
now
of
course
he
says
he
can
not
renew
so
ben
dear
do
you
not
remember
it
was
last
christmas
eve
strangely
proposed
and
i
declined
his
suit
does
not
this
seem
like
what
you
call
getting
even
with
us
darling
just
a
little
like
that
eh
he
is
a
vindictive
jealous
man
and
he
has
tried
to
ruin
you
that
is
all
love
that
mine
was
a
complete
fraud
just
his
way
of
wrecking
depend
on
it
i
am
right
did
you
send
anyone
to
examine
the
mine
do
you
know
positively
that
he
put
into
it
no
my
own
honest
unsuspicious
husband
i
see
you
did
not
well
be
assured
it
is
as
i
say
and
although
he
has
spoilt
our
christmas
eve
he
will
not
spoil
our
lives
or
our
love
a
woman
always
gets
a
keen
insight
into
the
character
of
the
man
who
loves
her
that
is
provided
she
does
not
love
him
when
she
returns
his
love
she
is
blind
and
can
see
none
of
his
faults
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
strangely
and
i
always
disliked
him
even
when
he
was
expressing
the
greatest
devotion
to
myself
he
is
a
bad
unprincipled
man
that
is
probably
not
just
what
the
commercial
agencies
say
about
him
but
i
know
i
am
nearer
the
truth
than
they
at
this
moment
a
ring
was
heard
at
the
outer
bell
and
cargill
rose
hastily
to
her
feet
exclaiming
that
must
be
my
brother
wilfred
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
i
had
a
dispatch
from
him
this
afternoon
saying
that
he
had
arrived
in
new
york
from
denver
and
would
be
here
by
this
evening
to
spend
his
christmas
with
us
i
have
not
seen
wilfred
for
more
than
five
years
and
am
so
glad
he
is
come
he
is
awfully
cheerful
and
will
keep
us
from
moping
and
he
is
so
lucky
to
everybody
but
himself
poor
boy
he
is
quite
poor
and
yet
he
has
been
the
means
of
making
many
people
rich
he
always
seems
to
bring
me
good
luck
and
have
you
not
seen
people
dear
who
were
on
the
contrary
what
is
called
who
were
always
trying
to
do
people
good
and
always
harming
them
quite
badly
no
oh
i
have
time
and
again
and
you
remember
in
bulwer
the
haco
who
is
always
trying
to
do
the
king
good
with
the
most
disastrous
results
and
is
finally
the
means
of
his
death
oh
i
am
so
glad
will
has
come
and
he
is
such
a
good
hypnotizer
too
and
so
the
dear
little
wife
rattled
on
inconsequently
as
if
eager
to
drive
out
all
miserable
thoughts
from
her
mind
but
with
all
her
semblance
of
cheerfulness
there
was
a
certain
hardness
of
outline
about
the
rounded
cheek
and
chin
which
was
not
noticeable
before
and
seemed
out
of
place
in
one
so
young
presently
her
brother
wilfred
was
ushered
into
the
room
and
introduced
to
her
husband
when
the
first
hearty
welcomes
were
over
and
the
evening
meal
had
been
discussed
wilfred
entertained
his
host
and
hostess
with
a
graphic
account
of
his
experiences
in
the
far
west
these
exhausted
his
sister
inquired
of
him
how
he
had
prospered
in
his
affairs
the
same
as
usual
was
his
response
a
bachelor
and
likely
so
to
remain
for
i
am
never
more
than
ahead
of
the
world
i
take
my
pleasure
as
it
comes
and
hoard
up
so
that
i
may
have
it
when
i
am
older
and
less
able
to
enjoy
the
was
a
man
of
the
most
acute
perceptions
and
he
soon
became
aware
of
a
heaviness
or
constraint
in
the
social
atmosphere
which
pained
him
more
almost
than
words
could
tell
heavens
he
murmured
to
himself
hope
my
sister
nell
has
not
made
an
unhappy
match
yet
i
can
not
imagine
ben
to
be
an
unkind
man
there
is
more
here
than
meets
the
eye
i
must
get
it
out
of
him
it
do
to
receive
any
confidences
from
her
if
i
am
to
make
any
use
of
he
looked
so
abstracted
in
his
musings
that
his
sister
brightening
up
forcibly
said
will
you
are
positively
dull
are
you
busy
hypnotizing
someone
now
in
the
distance
replied
the
brother
with
a
smile
fact
is
i
am
a
kind
of
wild
unregenerate
creature
whose
habits
get
away
with
him
at
times
having
no
wife
to
regulate
them
and
i
am
craving
for
a
cigar
with
all
the
force
of
a
weak
and
vicious
nature
if
you
have
a
den
where
i
can
tame
this
wild
beast
within
me
for
i
smoke
weeds
of
the
vilest
strength
i
will
come
back
in
an
hour
clothed
and
in
my
right
this
was
but
a
ruse
to
enable
him
to
be
alone
with
his
so
that
he
might
if
possible
induce
or
force
a
confession
from
him
as
to
the
cause
of
the
domestic
cloud
me
an
hour
with
auld
nick
growled
wilfred
to
himself
i
would
wring
the
inside
combination
of
the
doors
of
hades
out
of
when
the
two
men
emerged
an
hour
later
from
the
cozy
wilfred
knew
all
the
facts
of
the
domestic
tribulation
and
beyond
an
appearance
of
occasional
bore
the
confession
cheerily
about
dick
strangely
who
was
formerly
teller
in
the
bank
over
the
way
and
one
of
your
numerous
and
most
persistent
admirers
nell
he
inquired
hurriedly
remarked
his
i
not
tell
you
that
he
was
president
of
the
bank
over
the
way
who
held
my
you
certainly
did
not
now
nell
your
good
husband
has
told
me
all
about
his
trouble
and
i
want
your
opinion
about
it
you
used
to
be
pretty
perhaps
however
i
ought
to
have
said
pretty
so
he
occupies
the
flat
over
the
bank
does
he
was
the
inquiry
which
followed
his
opinion
expressed
in
womanly
fashion
but
with
a
sense
and
directness
which
caused
the
listener
to
weigh
well
every
word
that
fell
from
her
lips
as
he
made
the
inquiry
wilfred
rose
from
his
seat
parted
the
heavy
window
curtains
and
undoing
the
wooden
shutters
gazed
across
the
street
the
storm
had
abated
and
for
the
time
being
at
least
the
snow
had
ceased
to
fall
the
bright
from
the
street
fell
full
on
the
massive
front
of
the
bank
and
showed
a
white
face
and
cruel
merciless
gaze
turned
on
the
house
the
house
the
cargills
were
occupying
that
was
strangely
himself
was
it
not
remarked
will
and
the
other
nodding
his
reply
he
added
much
of
friendship
in
that
glance
mine
what
do
you
say
half
an
hour
later
the
new
arrival
begged
permission
to
retire
on
the
plea
of
fatigue
he
had
previously
urged
his
sister
to
give
him
a
bedroom
in
the
front
of
the
house
if
possible
want
to
study
the
banker
he
explained
i
can
not
think
properly
of
anyone
over
my
shoulder
or
through
a
number
of
empty
in
kissing
his
sister
he
whispered
in
her
ear
think
things
will
come
all
right
in
time
for
christmas
for
a
moment
she
brightened
up
and
then
with
a
little
doleful
sigh
she
replied
you
do
not
know
how
vindictive
that
banker
is
he
is
working
for
revenge
not
know
i
know
returned
her
brother
with
a
touch
of
impatience
you
just
believe
what
i
say
and
go
to
bed
in
peace
leave
things
to
me
i
have
straightened
out
worse
tangles
than
when
his
sister
had
left
the
room
he
drew
a
chair
in
front
of
the
clear
wood
fire
that
burned
in
the
low
grate
and
drawing
to
his
side
a
small
table
he
leaned
his
elbow
on
it
with
his
outspread
fingers
supporting
his
temples
for
fully
an
hour
he
remained
in
that
position
as
immovable
as
if
cast
in
bronze
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
rose
from
his
chair
pale
and
almost
ghostly
in
appearance
but
with
eyes
that
shone
supernaturally
large
and
bright
against
the
white
skin
of
his
face
there
was
an
air
of
set
tension
about
the
man
which
a
child
would
have
recognized
and
a
crocodile
of
the
ganges
have
given
the
right
of
the
road
to
the
fire
had
faded
away
to
smouldering
unnoticeable
embers
and
the
lamp
which
had
been
turned
down
since
his
sister
left
the
room
was
now
blown
out
moving
with
a
stride
of
extraordinary
expression
for
the
life
and
vigor
the
step
conveyed
wilfred
stepped
to
the
window
pulled
back
the
curtains
drew
up
the
blind
and
swiftly
but
noiselessly
raised
the
window
the
bank
across
the
way
lay
buried
in
repose
it
was
now
and
to
all
appearances
the
inmates
of
the
dwelling
apartments
over
it
were
all
in
bed
and
presumably
asleep
the
storm
had
abated
and
only
the
dark
unstarred
sky
above
and
the
snow
beneath
recalled
the
storm
which
had
so
recently
rioted
through
the
street
air
as
his
burning
eyes
rested
on
the
bank
building
or
rather
pierced
it
for
that
was
the
impression
their
fierce
intensity
conveyed
was
one
of
the
most
imperious
command
it
was
no
lifeless
brick
and
mortar
which
those
compelling
orbs
transfixed
and
which
the
moving
but
voiceless
lips
ordered
to
perform
their
behests
his
was
a
face
for
the
deadly
breach
or
the
forlorn
hope
and
it
grew
paler
and
paler
beyond
even
the
pallor
of
death
while
in
spite
of
the
gusts
of
icy
air
which
swept
in
through
the
open
window
the
dew
gathered
beaded
and
broke
on
his
forehead
and
mounted
the
stiffened
hair
that
rose
from
his
scalp
like
a
frozen
crest
it
was
evidently
no
ordinary
creature
with
which
this
ghostly
and
fantastic
struggle
was
being
waged
after
the
first
stern
bout
and
victory
there
was
a
cessation
of
action
for
a
few
minutes
but
soon
a
new
struggle
commenced
in
which
the
stern
visage
became
that
of
unbending
command
and
insistence
there
was
threat
too
in
the
eye
threat
of
dangerous
and
instant
action
at
this
point
the
watcher
seemed
to
look
for
some
noticeable
event
in
the
house
opposite
and
surely
enough
as
if
in
instant
obedience
to
his
wish
the
flicker
of
a
lamp
could
be
seen
descending
the
stairs
of
the
bank
building
presently
the
light
drifted
into
the
bank
itself
and
inside
the
railing
of
the
office
then
slowly
and
as
if
in
a
dream
the
bearer
could
be
seen
to
open
the
great
iron
safe
and
take
from
thence
a
portfolio
from
which
he
carefully
selected
a
document
and
then
returned
it
to
the
safe
at
this
juncture
a
night
policeman
saw
the
light
in
the
bank
and
hurried
across
the
street
preparatory
to
sounding
an
alarm
recognizing
the
president
however
by
the
light
of
his
lamp
he
desisted
and
stood
for
a
few
minutes
watching
his
movements
as
he
saw
him
enter
his
office
and
commence
to
write
a
letter
at
his
desk
he
resumed
his
round
merely
muttering
to
himself
late
for
banking
business
but
i
presume
he
forgot
returning
on
his
beat
half
an
hour
later
he
saw
the
banker
emerge
from
his
house
walk
across
the
way
and
drop
a
long
envelope
into
the
of
the
house
opposite
and
then
slowly
and
wearily
his
house
ten
minutes
later
and
the
light
died
out
from
the
dwelling
simultaneously
a
man
spent
and
exhausted
beyond
the
possibilities
of
ordinary
or
even
extraordinary
fatigue
closed
his
window
sank
into
an
and
lay
there
with
white
upturned
face
from
which
the
perspiration
dropped
in
big
round
beads
few
would
have
recognized
in
the
pallid
face
carved
by
deeply
hewn
lines
the
gay
debonair
countenance
of
wilfred
wharton
the
wit
and
of
the
plains
and
city
alike
the
following
morning
wilfred
was
up
betimes
notwithstanding
his
exhausting
labors
of
the
night
before
as
he
descended
to
the
he
met
his
sister
to
whose
inquiry
as
to
whether
he
had
been
able
to
devise
any
means
of
escape
from
their
desperate
situation
he
nodded
encouragingly
he
continued
must
get
me
the
key
of
your
at
once
before
your
husband
comes
down
it
is
necessary
for
the
success
of
my
plans
that
i
control
your
correspondence
for
a
few
within
the
he
found
a
long
envelope
bearing
the
printed
name
of
the
bank
this
he
promptly
opened
and
after
carefully
perusing
its
contents
nodded
in
a
satisfied
way
and
placed
it
in
an
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
then
returning
the
other
letters
unnoticed
to
the
box
he
carried
the
key
upstairs
to
his
sister
at
breakfast
nothing
was
said
of
the
subject
of
the
note
due
that
day
but
as
soon
as
the
servant
had
left
the
room
wilfred
plunged
into
the
subject
ben
he
began
have
got
to
follow
me
blindly
in
this
matter
or
i
can
not
help
you
if
you
agree
to
do
that
i
believe
i
can
get
you
out
of
this
mess
all
right
the
first
request
i
have
to
make
is
that
you
leave
town
for
the
day
without
having
any
communication
whatever
with
the
bank
you
may
return
in
good
time
for
dinner
and
i
will
promise
to
report
in
full
to
you
then
now
as
for
you
nell
if
they
send
across
for
cargill
from
the
bank
just
say
your
husband
is
out
of
town
for
the
day
and
will
not
be
back
till
the
evening
and
tell
them
you
know
nothing
about
his
business
i
am
going
out
of
town
myself
and
will
not
be
back
till
five
as
the
morning
wore
on
there
might
have
been
seen
a
look
of
vast
perplexity
and
uneasiness
on
the
face
of
banker
strangely
across
the
way
that
is
to
say
while
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
room
at
ten
on
going
through
his
private
portfolio
he
was
unable
to
find
the
note
of
hand
of
his
friend
benjamin
cargill
due
that
day
he
had
spent
an
hour
looking
for
it
and
still
finding
no
trace
of
it
he
sat
down
to
consider
the
situation
the
day
before
he
recollected
destroying
some
old
private
papers
taken
from
the
same
portfolio
and
although
he
had
been
exceedingly
careful
he
now
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
have
destroyed
the
note
among
those
papers
the
thought
of
being
baffled
of
his
revenge
against
cargill
for
her
former
slight
for
as
the
lady
rightly
surmised
it
and
not
friendship
which
inspired
the
banker
consumed
his
very
soul
with
rage
was
he
to
be
thus
thwarted
after
tracking
his
victim
down
not
while
his
brain
performed
its
accustomed
office
taking
pen
in
hand
he
wrote
the
following
letter
to
his
cargill
sir
beg
to
remind
you
that
your
note
for
in
my
favor
is
due
here
as
i
explained
to
you
if
the
amount
is
not
paid
by
three
the
note
will
go
to
protest
i
shall
be
very
sorry
indeed
to
have
to
resort
to
such
measures
but
for
the
reasons
already
given
you
i
have
no
the
reply
which
was
brought
back
was
cargill
is
out
of
town
for
the
day
the
letter
will
be
handed
to
him
on
his
this
indicated
either
a
neglect
or
indifference
of
the
intentions
which
made
the
latter
furious
wonder
where
on
earth
that
note
is
he
remarked
under
his
breath
feverishly
again
and
again
and
as
the
day
passed
he
grew
half
crazy
with
rage
at
he
rang
his
bell
for
his
and
after
opening
it
at
the
letter
he
carefully
studied
the
specimen
signature
given
there
by
cargill
when
he
opened
his
account
then
from
an
inner
drawer
he
took
a
promissory
note
blank
and
slowly
filled
it
in
using
for
the
purpose
a
bottle
of
stale
black
ink
is
not
forgery
he
murmured
as
if
excusing
himself
to
his
conscience
is
only
ten
minutes
later
he
rang
his
bell
and
sent
the
note
into
the
general
office
with
instructions
that
if
it
were
not
taken
up
by
three
the
teller
should
take
it
across
to
cargill
and
see
her
about
it
then
if
still
unpaid
he
directed
that
the
note
should
be
protested
the
note
being
unpaid
the
teller
called
on
cargill
who
politely
informed
him
that
she
knew
nothing
about
her
affairs
she
not
seem
anxious
and
perturbed
when
she
saw
the
note
sir
she
looked
at
the
handwriting
quietly
and
inquired
who
signed
her
name
to
snarled
the
banker
did
you
say
inquired
who
signed
her
name
to
the
note
and
i
replied
of
course
he
signed
it
himself
and
she
said
i
think
i
ought
to
know
signature
and
i
never
saw
it
as
shaky
as
that
before
he
must
have
been
put
out
when
he
signed
that
when
the
teller
retired
the
banker
sank
into
his
chair
in
a
heap
as
one
who
had
received
a
death
wound
heaven
he
ejaculated
am
i
doing
is
that
woman
going
to
drive
me
to
perdition
but
no
her
remarks
are
only
the
silly
talk
of
an
ignorant
woman
no
one
knows
about
the
note
being
saying
this
he
drove
his
hand
down
savagely
on
the
gong
on
his
table
and
when
the
clerk
appeared
in
response
to
his
summons
he
bade
him
in
imperious
tones
to
have
note
at
four
a
sleigh
drove
up
to
house
from
which
wilfred
alighted
after
requesting
the
driver
to
wait
for
further
instructions
learning
from
cargill
of
the
presentation
of
the
note
wilfred
the
sleigh
giving
the
driver
fresh
directions
in
a
tone
of
command
very
unusual
to
him
after
a
drive
of
a
mile
the
sleigh
stopped
at
the
house
of
a
justice
of
the
peace
for
the
second
time
that
day
on
issuing
from
the
house
of
the
justice
wilfred
gave
directions
to
be
driven
to
the
police
station
after
announcing
his
wishes
there
he
returned
to
his
house
and
finding
her
husband
had
returned
he
carried
him
off
to
the
office
of
the
notary
public
at
the
latter
place
they
inquired
whether
a
note
for
had
been
left
there
for
protest
that
day
on
learning
that
the
note
was
in
the
hands
and
would
remain
there
until
the
morning
the
justice
of
the
peace
was
again
visited
and
an
hour
later
the
notary
was
served
with
an
injunction
not
to
part
with
the
note
of
hand
once
more
the
sweet
bells
jangled
before
the
police
station
and
when
it
sped
on
its
way
again
its
ample
robe
enfolded
the
sturdy
albeit
somewhat
bandied
legs
of
the
night
policeman
whose
acquaintance
we
have
already
made
but
who
was
not
now
in
uniform
when
strangely
returned
to
his
residence
from
his
own
sleigh
ride
at
he
was
surprised
to
learn
that
three
gentlemen
awaited
him
in
the
parlor
are
they
he
inquired
of
the
servant
and
when
he
learned
that
cargill
was
one
of
the
number
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
gleefully
and
murmured
to
himself
last
at
last
i
have
got
you
in
the
toils
my
lady
with
the
dainty
devilish
face
that
refused
me
so
scornfully
a
year
the
look
with
which
he
entered
the
room
where
his
visitors
awaited
him
had
a
fine
and
scornful
air
of
contempt
about
it
suggestive
of
unsatiated
conquest
and
slaves
male
and
female
especially
female
dragging
at
his
victorious
wheel
are
come
to
take
up
that
note
i
presume
he
began
addressing
cargill
and
ignoring
his
companion
you
are
entirely
too
late
honorable
men
do
not
come
sneaking
into
a
bank
two
hours
after
it
has
been
closed
and
after
their
note
has
gone
to
protest
the
whole
town
will
know
that
your
note
has
been
protested
no
not
for
that
is
christmas
day
but
you
will
be
the
talk
of
the
town
the
following
day
and
no
doubt
reflection
will
sweeten
your
christmas
dinner
he
snarled
through
his
teeth
your
wife
sweetened
mine
a
year
ago
through
your
accursed
if
he
had
not
been
carried
away
by
his
feelings
he
would
have
noticed
the
peculiar
expression
on
the
faces
of
his
visitors
but
he
did
not
and
he
raved
on
until
in
a
stentorian
voice
wilfred
bade
him
be
silent
what
was
it
in
the
look
and
voice
of
that
man
that
made
the
banker
pause
and
wince
as
he
met
his
gaze
are
you
sir
that
dare
he
began
but
his
voice
faltered
and
his
whole
frame
seemed
to
shrink
as
he
met
the
full
lambent
eye
bent
upon
him
and
felt
it
thrilling
him
through
and
through
know
you
surely
he
said
slowly
and
almost
feebly
have
seen
you
before
somewhere
and
then
the
gaze
seemed
to
freeze
him
into
silence
to
me
banker
strangely
and
do
not
dare
to
open
your
mouth
till
i
have
have
been
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
ruin
my
friend
cargill
you
induced
him
to
give
you
to
invest
in
a
mine
named
the
longfellow
near
denver
and
give
you
his
note
for
and
you
told
him
you
were
paying
more
and
that
you
said
made
up
the
entire
purchase
money
to
insure
his
joining
you
you
showed
him
a
letter
from
the
manager
of
the
mine
named
george
williams
showing
that
very
large
profits
were
being
made
you
knew
anxiety
to
make
some
money
so
that
his
wife
who
had
had
so
many
rich
offers
might
not
pine
for
the
wealth
which
might
have
been
hers
o
revenge
was
sweet
to
you
and
you
played
your
cards
well
too
well
my
friend
for
your
own
comfort
now
you
thought
to
wreck
their
happiness
this
fair
christmas
eve
did
you
well
there
is
going
to
be
some
wrecking
done
my
friend
but
it
is
here
in
this
house
home
where
it
is
going
to
occur
and
not
over
the
way
in
the
home
of
the
woman
you
once
said
you
loved
whole
plot
is
laid
bare
i
hold
in
my
hand
in
your
own
handwriting
a
full
and
detailed
confession
of
your
villainy
which
you
wrote
out
last
night
and
sent
to
my
friend
together
with
the
note
for
which
you
acknowledged
you
had
got
from
him
by
fraud
there
it
is
and
see
you
have
endorsed
it
in
your
own
handwriting
and
added
your
private
stamp
to
it
in
the
same
letter
you
gave
my
friend
the
name
of
your
accomplice
george
williams
and
his
address
and
when
i
showed
him
your
letter
he
confessed
everything
too
and
told
me
a
good
deal
more
of
your
dealings
than
was
needful
for
my
is
all
a
lie
that
letter
is
a
forgery
i
never
wrote
it
and
that
note
was
stolen
from
the
bank
last
night
shrieked
the
banker
goaded
to
desperation
will
send
for
the
need
not
send
far
there
is
one
outside
the
door
returned
wilfred
then
opening
the
door
he
summoned
the
officer
to
enter
officer
in
private
clothes
is
the
policeman
who
was
on
duty
last
night
and
saw
you
enter
the
bank
office
unlock
the
safe
take
out
a
document
and
after
closing
the
safe
write
a
letter
which
you
enclosed
in
a
long
envelope
and
placed
with
your
own
hand
in
am
i
not
right
officer
correct
the
banker
sat
paralyzed
his
brain
benumbed
with
the
extraordinary
statement
made
to
him
was
it
all
a
dream
or
was
he
going
mad
and
then
like
a
flash
of
lightning
he
recollected
inquiring
that
morning
if
the
servant
knew
what
had
made
his
slippers
so
wet
it
was
the
snow
the
accursed
snow
as
he
crossed
the
street
to
ah
now
he
knew
they
were
speaking
the
truth
besides
that
was
undoubtedly
his
handwriting
and
his
seal
and
that
was
beyond
all
question
the
genuine
note
resumed
the
inexorable
wilfred
mindful
only
of
his
pain
of
what
you
had
done
in
your
sleeping
hours
and
being
unable
to
find
the
note
which
you
had
returned
to
its
rightful
owner
you
imagined
you
had
mislaid
it
and
lest
your
darling
revenge
for
which
you
had
imperilled
your
soul
should
escape
you
you
forged
a
fresh
note
which
being
of
course
unpaid
you
have
sent
to
the
for
protest
strangely
you
have
played
for
a
high
stake
the
wrecking
of
a
happy
home
and
you
have
lost
that
is
all
this
bright
snowy
christmas
eve
in
my
hand
here
i
hold
a
warrant
for
your
arrest
on
a
charge
of
conspiracy
with
williams
to
defraud
cargill
and
also
on
a
charge
of
forgery
i
have
obtained
an
injunction
preventing
the
notary
from
parting
with
the
forged
note
which
he
holds
and
i
have
williams
safe
in
prison
ready
to
bear
evidence
against
as
one
by
one
the
banker
heard
of
the
steps
taken
to
close
every
door
against
his
escape
his
head
drooped
lower
and
lower
me
he
murmured
brokenly
at
last
a
poor
desperate
man
save
me
and
make
as
he
glanced
on
the
two
faces
beside
him
the
policeman
had
retired
to
the
passage
he
saw
on
the
one
that
of
cargill
a
mingling
of
relief
and
amazement
for
the
revelations
were
not
one
whit
the
less
surprising
to
him
than
to
the
banker
and
on
the
other
only
relentless
determination
as
he
recognized
the
latter
he
sank
on
his
knees
and
begged
for
mercy
offering
to
pay
back
double
what
he
had
defrauded
his
former
friend
cargill
of
the
two
stepped
apart
for
a
moment
to
confer
urged
the
voice
man
was
until
recently
a
friend
he
became
an
enemy
because
nell
refused
him
for
me
her
rejection
of
his
desperate
love
for
her
has
made
a
scoundrel
of
him
i
imagine
it
would
have
made
a
villain
of
me
too
i
surely
can
afford
to
be
generous
when
i
win
all
around
i
can
not
send
a
man
i
once
called
by
the
name
of
friend
to
jail
on
christmas
eve
wait
here
and
i
will
go
across
and
talk
the
matter
over
with
my
wife
she
ought
to
be
consulted
on
this
her
here
was
the
laconic
reply
and
so
it
happened
that
the
mercy
which
dick
strangely
subsequently
received
that
night
was
taken
humbly
and
penitently
from
the
hand
of
the
woman
he
once
professed
to
love
but
whose
husband
and
home
he
ultimately
tried
to
ruin
the
banker
returned
the
money
that
night
of
which
he
had
defrauded
his
friend
and
he
also
returned
the
mortgages
he
offered
indeed
to
pay
back
double
but
his
offer
was
refused
with
scorn
and
loathing
dinner
at
was
an
hour
late
that
night
but
it
was
eaten
with
great
joy
and
happiness
of
heart
happiest
christmas
eve
of
my
life
exclaimed
cargill
with
eyes
whose
radiance
was
momentarily
dimmed
by
their
moisture
and
so
said
they
all
exclaimed
the
happy
wife
and
sister
as
she
rose
from
table
to
leave
the
two
gentlemen
to
their
cigar
will
never
never
understand
how
you
accomplished
what
you
did
i
believe
you
must
have
hypnotized
strangely
did
you
sir
tell
me
was
the
reply
with
a
curious
smile
curling
the
outer
wave
of
his
moustache
the
port
wine
is
with
you
me
wilfred
how
you
managed
it
pressed
his
replied
the
other
after
a
pause
is
not
fair
to
make
me
disclose
the
secrets
of
my
success
but
i
had
a
good
deal
of
influence
over
that
fellow
strangely
at
school
on
one
occasion
i
caught
him
at
a
very
disgraceful
trick
and
gave
him
a
very
memorable
thrashing
after
that
he
seemed
to
drift
into
my
power
somehow
partly
by
reason
of
his
disgrace
which
i
kept
to
myself
and
partly
because
a
good
thrashing
is
an
excellent
beginning
in
hypnotism
among
boys
as
the
result
i
could
make
him
do
anything
i
liked
with
such
a
i
had
no
difficulty
in
bringing
him
under
my
influence
last
night
more
especially
as
i
have
become
a
pretty
successful
hypnotist
by
long
practice
and
you
do
you
think
have
made
him
do
what
he
did
if
you
had
not
known
him
previously
i
think
i
would
probably
have
had
to
go
to
work
some
other
way
with
him
but
i
imagine
he
would
have
had
to
disgorge
all
the
same
hypnotism
as
an
art
is
full

the

when
from
time
wellnigh
immemorial
the
london
limited
express
has
started
for
scotland
the
individual
a
tall
man
of
perhaps
years
and
known
to
the
world
if
not
as
yet
to
fame
as
richard
dalrymple
as
the
traveller
hurriedly
took
his
seat
in
the
carriage
which
he
had
given
the
guard
a
couple
of
to
reserve
for
his
exclusive
use

looked

were
the
multitudinous

was
drowned
in
the
hearty
laughter
and
loud
badinage
which
somehow
or
other
appear
to
be
inseparable
from
this
station
possibly
as
a
sort
of
counterpoise
to
the
somewhat
different
style
of
from
the
northern
and
sadder
end
of
the
line
where
the
ties
of
friendship
or
kinship
are
apt
to
be
closer
and
farewells
longer
and
more
affecting
as
richard
dalrymple
looked
out
upon
the
scene
he
thanked
his
lucky
stars
that
there
was
no
one
there
to
bid
and
lest
even
a
passing
acquaintance
should
recognize
him
he
hurriedly
drew
the
window
curtains
and
retired
into
the
seclusion
of
his
carriage
god
he
murmured
to
himself
as
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
glad
off
it
was
safer
to
run
away
she
carries
altogether
too
many
guns
for
as
if
to
divert
his
mind
from
painful
thoughts
he
glanced
out
into
the
night
and
watched
for
a
while
after
an
fashion
the
wayside
stations
as
they
fled
past
in
endless
procession
then
an
inbound
express
dashed
by
apparently
smashing
all
the
crockery
of
the
world
as
it
went
and
the
shock
so
far
dislocated
his
ideas
as
to
induce
him
to
leave
the
window
suppose
i
may
as
well
make
myself
comfortable
he
presently
murmured
to
himself

four
hundred
miles
away
and
there
is
no
change
of
saying
this
he
exchanged
his
tall
hat
for
the
regulation
used
in
those
days
as
he
uncovered
his
head
his
profile
crowned
with
a
profusion
of
light
brown
curls

as

and

as
to

and

all

vowed
richard
dalrymple
at
first
sight
a
man
too
they
were
prone
to
add
when
they
saw
his
width
of
shoulder
and
length
of
limb
and
noted
the
frank
fearless
look
of
the
dark
blue
eyes
and
yet
as
he
opened
his
to
while
away
with
weed
the
tedium
of
the
long
hours
there
was
an
air
of
anxiety
perceptible
on
his
brow
and
a
worn
look
expressive
of
much
turmoil
and
uncertainty
of
mind
visible
around
his
eyes
which
to
all
appearance
the
joy
he
had
expressed
at
his
escape
had
not
to
any
appreciable
extent
relieved
as
the
dainty
of
russia
leather
lay
in
his
grasp
a
tender
look
came
into
his
eyes
and
opening
the
clasp
two
lovely
bunches
of
blue
scotch
lay
before
him
worked
in
silk
in
marked
relief
on
the
soft
lining
of
the
case
as
he
sat
gazing
at
the
small
blue
flowers
a
soft
mist
crept
into
his
eyes
and
rose
and
rose
until
it
blotted
out
both
flowers
and
and
blurred
the
light
blazing
overhead
then
from
the
innermost
receptacle
of
his
he
took
a
piece
of
soft
tissue
paper
and
extracted
from
it
with
much
tenderness
the
half
of
a
piece
which
after
putting
tenderly
to
his
lips
he
laid
alongside
the
blue
is
just
three
years
ago
he
murmured
to
himself
jeannie
gave
me
these
when
i
first
left
for
london
to
try
my
hand
at
medicine
there
i
remember
the
very
words
of
the
old
song
which
she
repeated
as
she
gave
me
the
half
of
the
broken
coin
take
this
lucky
thrupenny
bit
help
you
bear
in
mind
a
faithful
loving
trusting
heart
you
left
in
tears
and
although
i
have
never
seen
my
darling
since
i
have
been
true
to
her
in
word
and
thought
and
deed
indeed
i
have
he
repeated
almost
fiercely
as
though
someone
had
challenged
his
statement
and
then
as
if
a
twinge
of
remorse
tortured
him
he
cried
out
forgive
me
pet
if
i
have
ever
wavered
even
for
a
moment
you
know
i
have
never
loved
anyone
but
the
heavy
tears
dropped
from
his
eyes
and
fell
on
the
blue
and
then
as
if
ashamed
to
show
his
womanishness
even
to
the
walls
opposite
he
looked
out
into
the
night
through
which
the
express
now
plunged
on
its
furious
way
rocking
under
its
gait
richard
dalrymple
was
what
is
termed
a
good
square
man
and
under
the
strongest
conceivable
temptation
to
prove
himself
a
renegade
he
was
doing
his
utmost
and
not
by
any
means
with
only
to
prove
himself
true
to
his
little
scottish
sweetheart
the
cause
not
of
his
apostasy
for
he
was
still
true
in
word
and
deed
and
yes
in
thought
too
to
his
but
of
his
anxiety
was
all
unknown
to
him
seated
in
the
adjoining
carriage
with
a
smile
of
mingled
triumph
and
apprehension
lighting
up
her
splendid
dark
eyes
when
richard
dalrymple
had
regained
his
composure
and
had
lit
his
cigar
the
lady
in
the
next
compartment
detecting
the
odor
smiled
again
yourself
at
home
she
murmured
with
a
softer
light
in
her
brilliant
eyes
a
sweet
she
added
tenderly
throwing
a
mute
kiss
with
both
hands
in

a
medical
practice
in
the
of
london
it
seemed
only
natural
that
the
beattisons
who
generally
spent
from
five
to
six
months
in
the
metropolis
each
year
should
patronize
him
more
especially
as
they
knew
him
to
be
well
trained
in
his
profession
and
well
thought
of
among
his
brother
practitioners
dalrymple
was
an
attractive
man
a
good
talker
and
possessed
of
a
magnetism
which
drew
other
men
to
him
he
was
popular
and
was
accordingly
in
demand
and
at
no
house
was
he
more
welcome
than
at
the
home
of
general
beattison
but
complications
soon
arose
beattison
had
died
while
her
daughter
gwendoline
an
only
child
was
still
in
the
nursery
and
the
education
had
largely
devolved
upon
governesses
at
home
and
abroad
whom
her
naturally
dominant
will
soon
reduced
to
subjection
the
result
was
that
by
the
time
she
was
sixteen
years
of
age
miss
beattison
was
a
law
unto
herself
and
it
might
be
added
with
some
show
of
truth
to
her
father
also
she
was
now
years
of
age
and
all
the
talk
of
in
her
matchless
beauty
the
despair
alike
of
painters
and
poets
from
her
mother
she
had
inherited
her
black
castilian
hair
and
glorious
dark
eyes
together
with
that
magnetism
of
glance
and
capacity
for
arousing
or
manifesting
passion
which
seems
the
heritage
of
seductive
daughters
from
her
side
had
sprung
the
height
and
stateliness
which
marked
her
carriage
and
the
unresting
audacity
of
the
blood
was
readily
visible
when
miss
gwendoline
entered
the
lists
courted
by
all
and
the
belle
of
the
london
season
gwendoline
was
true
to
an
early
but
undisclosed
infatuation
for
richard
dalrymple
and
with
scant
courtesy
she
refused
the
best
offers
of
the
season
the
score
bent
upon
securing
the
only
being
she
had
made
up
her
mind
she
could
love
richard
although
by
no
means
insensible
to
miss
charms
was
true
to
his
scotch
and
feeling
the
fair
passion
for
him
becoming
more
and
more
marked
and
unable
to
see
that
he
was
holding
his
own
satisfactorily
he
deemed
discretion
the
better
part
of
valor
and
as
we
have
seen
fled
miss
beattison
who
had
fathomed
his
plans
determined
to
follow
him
believing
that
only
some
mistaken
notion
of
chivalry
on
his
side
kept
them
apart
and
convinced
in
her
own
mind
that
they
were
made
for
each
other
and
wholly
unwilling
that
both
their
lives
should
be
ruined
by
a
false
delicacy
on
her
part
it
will
be
seen
that
her
views
were
very
far
indeed
from
being
orthodox
on
the
question
of
rights
so
far
as
they
relate
to
courtship
but
as
against
this
it
may
be
said
that
no
breath
of
suspicion
had
ever
been
raised
against
her
fair
fame
and
that
her
determination
in
following
dalrymple
was
consistent
with
a
hereditary
obstinacy
in
legitimate
pursuits
once
she
was
satisfied
as
to
what
was
the
right
thing
for
her
to
do
as
richard
dalrymple
finished
his
third
cigar
the
train
was
nearing
rugby
station
its
first
stopping
place
preacher
was
entirely
right
he
muttered
as
he
threw
away
the
end
of
his
cigar
a
bushel
full
of
wheat
and
there
will
be
no
room
for
i
have
not
been
thinking
enough
of
jeannie
or
this
thing
would
never
have
worried
me
dear
little
darling
he
suddenly
burst
out
with
a
new
accession
of
fervor
as
he
took
a
photograph
from
his
pocket
and
kissed
it
again
and
again
will
have
a
thousand
copies
of
that
photograph
made
and
i
will
put
them
everywhere
in
my
house
and
study
and
in
my
pockets
so
that
people
will
say
a
model
lover
he
is
and
that
will
stimulate
me
to
be
still
better
than
i
he
kept
on
talking
for
some
time
until
he
became
conscious
of
an
undue
earnestness
in
his
avowals
heavens
he
suddenly
exclaimed
hope
i
am
not
protesting
too
much
oh
no
no
how
can
i
talk
like
that
when
i
am
within
eight
hours
of
the
sweetest
lips
in
christendom
all
mine
too
exclusively
unkissed
unreaped
for
three
years
and
just
just
here
hyperbole
failed
him
just
too
sweet
for
lovely
blue
eyes
that
rounded
neck
and
that
yellow
hair
and
those
dear
arms
o
dear
i
feel
them
now
even
after
three
long
years
hate
dark
eyes
and
black
hair
and
all
your
southern
beauty
i
wonder
i
ever
gave
it
a
thought
it
is
so
commonplace
beside
the
charm
of
the
ravishing
in
his
excitement
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
was
pacing
backwards
and
forwards
in
his
carriage
thrusting
his
arms
out
forcibly
in
front
of
him
as
if
in
an
effort
to
throw
off
excitement
in
turning
his
hand
struck
the
frame
of
the
window
forcibly
and
the
photograph
fell
from
his
grasp
underneath
the
seat
as
he
stooped
to
recover
it
he
saw
a
handkerchief
alongside
it
this
he
at
first
mistook
for
his
own
until
the
softness
of
its
texture
undeceived
him
rising
to
his
feet
he
held
the
handkerchief
somewhat
carelessly
to
the
light
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
nothing
better
to
do
to
see
if
he
could
discover
any
initials
upon
it
as
he
did
so
he
became
conscious
of
a
subtle
perfume
and
it
moved
him
horribly
as
some
men
die
without
being
moved
his
knees
gave
way
through
the
weakness
and
he
sat
down
there
was
he
felt
but
one
person
in
all
england
who
used
that
dainty
oriental
perfume
she
had
told
him
so
and
that
one
was
herself
lest
there
should
be
any
doubt
as
to
the
identity
of
the
handkerchief
there
too
was
the
monogram
in
gold
and
black
on
the
corner
the
initials
subtly
intertwined
in
silence
richard
dalrymple
sat
with
whitening
face
looking
at
the
delicate
piece
of
cambric
in
his
hands
god
he
suddenly
burst
out
is
the
matter
with
me
it
is
all
i
can
do
to
keep
myself
from
kissing
it
his
hand
shook
as
it
held
the
piece
of
vagrant
cambric
and
when
the
train
entered
rugby
station
a
man
in
the
depths
of
knelt
on
the
floor
of
compartment
with
his
head
buried
in
the
cushions
of
the
seat
chapter
iii
while
the
train
was
standing
in
the
station
at
rugby
and
the
majority
of
the
male
passengers
were
taking
their
last
at
the
bar
of
the
refreshment
room
before
composing
themselves
finally
to
sleep
a
voice
of
somewhat
uncertain
fibre
called
to
the
guard
as
he
passed
the
window
of
the
carriage
occupied
by
richard
dalrymple
come
here
a
minute
can
you
tell
me
how
that
handkerchief
got
into
this
carriage
and
the
speaker
handed
the
dainty
piece
of
cambric
which
he
had
found
to
the
astonished
guard
before
the
latter
had
time
to
frame
a
reply
a
shrill
female
voice
from
the
next
compartment
called
out
here
at
once
please
guard
quick
the
call
was
so
urgent
and
the
necessity
of
the
caller
apparently
so
desperate
that
with
a
hasty
me
one
moment
sir
to
richard
dalrymple
the
guard
stepped
to
the
door
of
the
adjoining
compartment
inside
please
guard
crushed
my
finger
in
the
window
and
get
it
as
soon
as
the
guard
had
entered
the
carriage
the
lady
who
had
called
him
miss
companion
promptly
placed
herself
in
front
of
the
door
to
prevent
anyone
from
seeing
inside
and
then
waved
the
guard
toward
her
mistress
conductor
please
tell
me
said
the
other
with
great
eagerness
the
gentleman
in
the
next
compartment
found
i
overheard
part
of
your
conversation
but
not
miss
he
found
this
handkerchief
and
it
seems
to
have
startled
him
very
considerably
dear
dear
it
is
one
of
mine
which
i
must
have
dropped
in
that
place
you
will
remember
that
you
showed
us
into
that
compartment
first
of
all
but
i
exchanged
it
for
this
one
because
it
gave
me
a
better
view
of
the
entrance
gate
and
enabled
me
to
see
who
was
going
off
by
train
guard
that
gentleman
next
door
is
a
friend
of
mine
but
i
would
not
for
all
the
world
he
knew
i
was
near
him
he
would
certainly
want
to
travel
in
the
same
carriage
and
that
would
be
quite
a
nuisance
him
the
handkerchief
must
have
been
left
there
by
one
of
a
party
of
northern
visitors
to
london
and
must
have
escaped
the
notice
steady
now
and
on
no
account
let
him
suspect
that
i
am
in
this
carriage
and
a
small
golden
coin
changed
hands
when
the
guard
returned
to
dalrymple
the
latter
questioned
him
as
to
what
was
wrong
next
door
jammed
her
hand
in
the
window
me
and
did
you
raise
the
window
and
relieve
her
hand
poor
no
sir
come
to
reflect
hang
me
if
i
think
i
did
this
with
evident
shamefacedness
are
a
funny
fellow
guard
after
being
called
to
open
a
window
and
relieve
a
suffering
damsel
you
come
away
not
only
without
taking
off
the
pressure
but
you
forget
all
about
it
get
out
of
my
way
and
attend
to
the
suffering
on
sir
stop
i
say
stop
called
out
the
guard
resisting
the
exit
hand
is
all
right
now
and
besides
i
told
you
the
worst
the
lady
is
in
a
high
fever
and
and
it
looks
like
i
want
to
tell
you
at
first
he
went
on
mendaciously
you
have
forced
it
out
of
me
please
say
anything
about
it
or
get
into
heavens
ejaculated
the
traveller
an
awful
calamity
i
wish
you
would
stand
a
little
further
off
suppose
he
added
under
his
breath
should
carry
the
infection
to
then
he
added
aloud
as
the
other
was
leaving
have
not
explained
how
that
handkerchief
came
to
be
in
this
that
is
a
very
simple
matter
sir
replied
the
other
promptly
with
an
for
a
penny
in
for
a
air
party
of
ladies
came
up
to
london
in
this
carriage
on
my
last
trip
and
i
suppose
one
of
them
dropped
her
handkerchief
under
the
seat
by
accident
the
name
on
their
trunks
was
bertrand
and
i
heard
one
of
the
young
ladies
called
georgiana
and
the
initials
being
the
same
continued
the
guard
giving
full
swing
to
his
imagination
suppose
the
handkerchief
belongs
to
sounds
all
right
returned
dalrymple
giving
a
side
glance
at
the
piece
of
cambric
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
have
asked
for
it
had
he
only
known
what
excuse
to
make
for
his
request
now
as
the
lady
in
the
adjoining
carriage
anxious
that
our
traveller
should
have
a
reminder
of
her
had
with
much
and
unwonted
palpitation
of
heart
suggested
to
the
conductor
the
propriety
of
returning
the
handkerchief
to
the
finder
he
had
no
particular
difficulty
in
meeting
the
unspoken
request
suppose
you
may
as
well
place
that
handkerchief
where
you
found
it
the
guard
remarked
handing
it
to
dalrymple
as
he
closed
the
door
is
the
usual
i
suppose
so
replied
the
other
with
affected
indifference
receiving
the
precious
article
from
his
hands
as
the
train
sped
on
its
way
dalrymple
sat
for
a
while
with
corrugated
brow
then
he
suddenly
muttered
as
he
lit
a
last
cigar
before
turning
in
for
the
night
explanation
might
account
for
the
initials
but
how
about
the
perfume
the
coincidence
is
too
striking
i
understand
it
and
i
believe
that
scare
next
door
is
all
a
affair
i
wonder
who
the
people
are
who
curtain
themselves
so
closely
in
there
and
what
they
mean
by
fooling
the
guard
he
awoke
once
during
the
night
to
find
himself
with
a
photograph
of
his
in
one
hand
and
the
handkerchief
in
the
other
this
arrangement
stung
him
to
the
heart
and
he
made
as
though
he
wanted
to
throw
the
handkerchief
out
of
the
window
no
he
said
to
himself
in
time
might
need
it
as
a
reminder
that
i
must
brace
myself
and
drive
all
thoughts
of
miss
beattison
out
of
my
that
this
reasoning
was
faulty
was
more
than
proved
by
the
rapid
softening
of
the
severe
glance
which
he
directed
towards
the
fluffy
piece
of
cambric
which
as
if
half
afraid
of
some
necromantic
influence
he
held
gingerly
between
his
finger
and
thumb
he
said
believe
that
story
about
in
the
next
compartment
or
that
high
old
tale
you
told
me
about
the
lady
crushing
her
hand
now
who
these
people
next
door
and
what
little
game
are
they
dragging
you
into
know
anything
more
about
them
than
i
have
told
you
returned
the
conductor
somewhat
curtly
got
too
many
daft
people
bothering
me
all
the
time
without
hunting
up
fresh
saying
this
he
raised
his
silver
whistle
to
his
lips
and
blew
a
loud
blast
at
the
same
time
waving
his
right
arm
up
and
down
toward
the
engineer
like
a
crazy
semaphore
all
of
which
was
the
signal
to
go
ahead
dalrymple
retired
to
his
seat
with
a
rather
chagrined
smile
personal
that
remark
he
said
as
he
recomposed
himself
for
sleep
i
suppose
he
worried
quite
a
good
deal
by
queer
people
this
line
seems
to
be
haunted
chapter
iv
when
dalrymple
awoke
again
dawn
was
breaking
coldly
and
slowly
among
the
mountains
of
the
lake
district
when
he
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
of
his
carriage
the
fresh
chilly
air
of
the
hills
carried
his
memory
back
with
a
rush
to
his
old
scotch
days
and
to
the
time
of
his
courtship
my
little
pet
he
murmured
turning
to
the
photograph
in
his
hand
seems
but
yesterday
since
you
and
i
plighted
our
troth
to
each
other
on
just
such
a
hillside
as
this
one
here
i
remember
the
smell
of
the
heather
that
day
and
how
i
could
hardly
find
you
a
place
to
sit
down
on
in
the
soft
velvety
sward
because
you
said
you
never
liked
to
crush
the
bonny
and
they
were
all
around
us
and
the
lark
i
recollect
rose
from
our
feet
and
soared
aloft
and
we
said
it
was
singing
us
a
wedding
march
that
big
intrusive
too
that
would
fly
around
our
heads
we
could
not
bear
to
hurt
it
we
were
so
happy
ourselves
and
i
have
never
even
killed
a
wasp
since
for
the
memory
of
the
time
ah
and
i
remember
too
jeannie
the
touch
of
your
dear
little
hand
so
plump
and
firm
and
the
look
in
your
bonny
blue
eyes
when
i
told
you
i
loved
you
and
asked
you
to
marry
me
you
looked
so
beautiful
and
shy
was
the
happiest
man
on
earth
till
that
day
and
there
never
has
anything
come
between
us
until
as
he
ended
there
was
a
sharp
tone
of
anger
in
his
last
words
and
rising
quickly
and
with
much
energy
he
opened
the
window
and
threw
from
it
with
all
his
force
the
poor
little
piece
of
monogrammed
cambric
which
had
been
lying
on
the
seat
before
him
as
this
little
incident
culminated
the
train
was
slowing
down
to
enter
the
small
station
where
travellers
to
the
lakes
break
their
journey
and
a
barefooted
youngster
who
had
run
out
to
meet
the
train
caught
the
handkerchief
as
it
fluttered
and
eddied
from
the
advancing
train
a
lady
sitting
at
the
adjoining
window
which
was
open
heard
the
violent
banging
of
the
sash
ahead
and
saw
the
handkerchief
thrown
forcibly
out
to
that
boy
instantly
madame
to
give
you
that
the
speaker
was
miss
beattison
and
as
she
made
way
for
her
companion
at
the
window
the
natural
pallor
of
her
face
became
almost
ghastly
as
she
placed
her
hand
to
her
side
oh
she
moaned
last
he
has
broken
my
heart
now
indeed
i
know
how
much
he
hates
and
loathes
me
by
his
throwing
my
poor
little
handkerchief
out
of
the
window
as
if
it
was
infected
by
the
plague
oh
how
he
must
despise
me
here
gentle
nature
came
to
the
relief
of
the
sleepless
one
and
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
passionate
tears
the
boy
got
the
handkerchief
she
inquired
through
her
sobs
mademoiselle
here
he
comes
with
it
running
alongside
the
take
it
from
him
quickly
dear
the
sobbing
maiden
faltered
i
think
i
shall
die
of
shame
and
bring
that
handkerchief
here
it
belongs
to
me
shouted
a
commanding
voice
from
the
carriage
ahead
and
at
the
sound
of
it
the
tears
in
miss
eyes
stood
still
a
frozen
cataract
lady
wants
it
sir
she
says
it
is
hers
protested
the
boy
madame
slay
that
boy
said
miss
beattison
in
a
fierce
little
whisper
lady
is
mistaken
bring
that
handkerchief
here
at
it
is
a
handkerchief
sir
urged
the
boy
it
here
at
once
you
little
devil
or
break
your
coarse
words
these
and
oh
how
impolite
to
the
other
claimants
and
yet
sweeter
far
to
the
straining
ears
of
the
offended
one
than
the
softest
music
but
the
boy
was
in
the
face
of
ugly
words
or
threats
and
he
held
out
the
handkerchief
to
the
lady
at
the
window
no
give
it
to
the
gentleman
said
madame
and
after
a
hesitation
the
boy
threw
the
handkerchief
into
the
carriage
where
dalrymple
was
standing
dalrymple
endeavored
to
reward
the
boy
by
throwing
him
a
shilling
but
the
threat
was
not
forgotten
and
the
boy
who
came
of
a
fighting
stock
threw
the
coin
back
into
the
carriage
dalrymple
saw
with
surprise
a
coin
of
large
dimensions
fall
into
the
hands
from
the
other
window
and
he
lighted
a
matutinal
cigar
to
try
and
cipher
out
the
peculiar
kind
of
lunatics
there
were
imprisoned
in
that
adjoining
compartment
as
for
the
eventful
handkerchief
as
if
he
were
ashamed
of
having
had
it
brought
back
he
let
it
lie
where
it
fell
next
door
an
unusual
occurrence
had
already
taken
place
rising
to
her
feet
and
swaying
to
and
fro
in
the
excess
of
her
emotion
and
with
her
beautiful
eyes
swimming
in
happy
tears
gwendoline
beattison
threw
herself
on
the
hard
bosom
but
not
hard
heart
of
her
old
companion
and
friend
and
murmured
as
she
flung
her
arms
around
her
neck
it
was
all
a
mistake
he
did
not
intend
to
throw
away
my
handkerchief
did
you
notice
how
furious
he
was
the
darling
when
he
thought
some
one
was
going
to
take
it
eh
at
which
by
way
of
reply
the
truthful
companion
groaned
with
much
and
genuine
distress
shall
find
out
all
about
this
mystery
of
the
next
compartment
once
i
get
to
carlisle
station
muttered
richard
dalrymple
to
himself
stop
there
fifteen
minutes
for
breakfast
and
it
will
be
strange
if
i
find
out
what
particular
kind
of
asylum
i
have
next
door
saying
this
he
relit
his
cigar
and
gave
his
eyes
to
the
dreamy
study
of
the
northern
landscape
while
his
mind
projected
itself
ahead
to
the
meeting
so
soon
to
take
place
between
himself
and
his
sweetheart
from
whom
he
had
been
parted
for
three
long
years
but
best
laid
plans
of
mice
and
men
gang
aft
aglee
especially
when
it
is
a
wit
which
is
the
disturbing
influence
at
the
last
station
before
entering
carlisle
miss
beattison
called
the
guard
to
her
and
begged
that
he
would
find
an
empty
carriage
in
the
rear
of
the
train
their
carriage
was
now
in
front
for
herself
and
companion
into
which
they
could
change
the
moment
the
gentleman
in
the
adjoining
compartment
should
leave
it
for
his
breakfast
suppose
he
does
not
leave
it
gloomily
queried
the
guard
who
smoke
so
much
in
the
early
morning
can
easily
wait
for
their
breakfast
until
they
get
in
that
case
responded
the
lady
will
try
some
other
plan
but
this
will
do
until
we
know
it
be
carried
out
and
at
carlisle
we
will
keep
our
curtains
closed
until
you
give
us
warning
to
change
in
case
he
should
feel
inclined
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
about
the
way
guard
resumed
the
lady
after
a
momentary
pause
and
with
a
little
tremor
in
the
voice
you
happen
to
notice
what
he
did
with
the
handkerchief
madam
it
is
lying
on
the
seat
in
front
of
him
and
he
is
studying
a
is
all
guard
thank
you
returned
the
lady
in
a
fainter
tone
as
she
leaned
her
head
back
on
the
cushioned
partition
look
faint
mademoiselle
said
her
companion
hastening
to
her
side
with
an
anxious
look
in
her
eyes
mademoiselle
try
a
little
you
no
replied
her
mistress
think
it
is
only
that
i
am
a
little
faint
after
my
long
she
sat
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
while
the
companion
watched
the
pallid
face
and
the
white
lids
and
long
dark
lashes
which
hid
the
beautiful
eyes
there
was
a
saddened
droop
in
the
beautiful
mouth
with
its
gracefully
curved
lips
as
if
bow
had
been
bent
just
a
little
awry
and
where
oh
where
was
that
imperious
look
which
was
wont
to
be
enthroned
on
that
boldly
rounded
chin
the
change
was
love
the
work
the
silken
scarf
thrown
over
the
shapely
head
had
fallen
aside
and
now
showed
the
beautiful
hair
in
all
the
graceful
abandon
consequent
upon
a
comfortless
travel
the
dusky
tresses
with
the
wave
of
a
banderol
in
them
grew
low
and
luxurious
over
the
broad
white
forehead
and
curled
upwards
in
wealthy
profusion
over
the
graceful
head
the
beautiful
and
strongly
marked
eyebrows
the
densely
fringed
lids
and
all
the
component
parts
of
superlative
beauty
were
there
men
talk
of
alabaster
loveliness
of
faces
pale
and
perfect
as
flawless
marble
but
these
similes
fell
far
short
of
miss
complexion
which
was
the
despair
of
the
rest
of
the
sex
in
her
case
these
would
have
been
dead
illustrations
of
a
living
glorious
beauty
to
which
neither
nature
nor
art
could
furnish
an
analogy
or
an
expression
her
beautiful
eyes
now
closed
in
reflections
like
her
other
perfections
defied
descriptions
and
beggared
eulogy
even
byron
in
the
art
of
portraying
ravishing
beauty
recorded
his
failure
to
describe
the
beauty
of
lovely
eyes
and
his
words
might
well
be
appropriated
for
miss
beattison
dark
charm
vain
to
tell
but
gaze
on
that
of
the
gazelle
it
will
assist
thy
fancy
suddenly
the
dark
eyes
opened
widely
and
the
taper
fingers
clenched
in
a
paroxysm
of
emotion
why
should
i
waste
myself
upon
a
man
who
does
not
care
for
me
she
cried
out
bitterly
have
i
done
that
heaven
should
grant
me
power
to
love
only
one
man
when
it
makes
that
man
despise
me
and
prefer
an
ignorant
scotch
country
girl
whose
love
as
compared
with
mine
is
as
the
shallow
to
the
bottomless
mademoiselle
give
him
up
let
us
go
back
he
is
not
worthy
of
you
there
are
a
thousand
handsomer
cleverer
men
distinguished
men
too
who
would
kneel
at
your
feet
yes
mademoiselle
and
put
proud
coronets
there
too
and
splendid
men
too
ah
if
the
poor
companion
could
but
choose
there
are
some
ravishing
gentlemen
who
visit
you
and
think
you
that
i
would
run
after
a
country
doctor
and
break
my
heart
when
all
the
great
world
would
come
to
me
ah
madame
replied
the
other
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
know
of
course
i
know
and
the
thought
drives
me
nearly
crazy
with
rage
against
myself
that
i
am
doing
an
indelicate
and
unmaidenly
thing
in
following
up
dalrymple
oh
i
have
fought
against
this
love
on
my
knees
yes
on
my
bended
knees
but
i
can
not
help
myself
i
love
him
love
i
love
him
even
when
i
wore
short
dresses
he
was
all
unknown
to
him
the
idol
of
my
childhood
yes
i
used
to
dream
about
him
and
pray
god
to
give
me
him
for
a
dear
husband
when
i
grew
up
i
remember
him
as
he
used
to
come
up
the
church
aisle
on
sundays
and
as
he
passed
our
i
used
to
redden
until
i
fancied
all
the
people
in
the
church
knew
about
my
love
for
him
and
during
the
sermon
i
never
recollected
the
text
or
remembered
what
the
old
clergyman
said
i
was
just
thinking
of
richard
that
is
what
i
called
him
in
my
mind
and
longing
to
run
my
fingers
through
his
bonny
curly
brown
hair
and
oh
when
his
moustache
began
to
grow
as
soon
as
i
noticed
it
i
insisted
on
being
put
into
long
dresses
so
that
i
might
as
it
were
keep
in
step
with
him
and
when
i
went
abroad
it
was
still
the
same
all
the
years
i
was
away
nothing
ever
took
his
boyish
image
out
of
my
heart
i
did
not
flirt
and
carry
on
like
other
girls
i
just
thought
of
him
and
waited
oh
so
patiently
until
my
education
should
be
completed
and
i
could
return
home
practically
my
own
mistress
madame
do
you
think
that
love
like
that
is
going
to
stop
because
a
thing
seems
unmaidenly
when
all
the
happiness
of
my
life
is
concerned
in
the
result
do
you
know
that
dalrymple
is
now
on
his
way
to
see
his
and
that
this
is
the
most
crucial
period
of
my
whole
life
oh
if
i
were
a
man
and
our
positions
reversed
i
would
carry
him
off
madame
was
in
despair
she
held
up
her
wrinkled
hands
and
exclaimed
again
and
again
dieu
mon
dieu
and
then
her
womanly
heart
coming
to
her
aid
she
took
the
beautiful
head
between
her
hands
and
kissed
it
again
and
again
is
good
she
said
softly
but
hopefully
it
will
all
come
right
large
tears
the
advance
guard
of
thunder
shower
which
indicates
but
does
not
relieve
the
passion
gathered
slowly
and
fell
from
miss
eyes
and
the
white
teeth
tried
hard
to
restrain
the
quivering
lip
but
the
effort
was
in
vain
the
rising
sob
refused
to
be
quelled
and
unable
any
longer
to
restrain
her
emotion
miss
beattison
covered
her
face
and
sobbed
out
her
very
soul
on
her
old
sympathetic
shoulder
muttered
the
companion
aside
to
herself
i
were
a
man
and
had
a
knife
i
would
kill
you
and
she
shook
her
clenched
fist
at
the
invisible
traveller
next
door
when
carlisle
station
was
reached
dalrymple
stepped
quickly
from
his
carriage
thinking
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
inmates
of
the
adjoining
compartment
the
curtains
however
were
closed
and
no
sign
of
life
was
visible
i
imagine
soliloquized
the
doctor
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
have
some
breakfast
saying
which
he
sauntered
in
the
direction
of
the
restaurant
when
he
returned
the
window
of
the
carriage
next
door
was
in
the
same
condition
asleep
he
murmured
as
he
lit
his
cigar
and
the
train
moved
outward
dalrymple
was
in
error
however
for
the
change
of
carriage
had
been
effected
while
he
was
at
breakfast
and
his
whilom
companions
were
now
a
dozen
carriages
to
the
rear
at
the
next
station
the
first
on
scotch
soil
noticing
the
adjoining
door
open
dalrymple
inquired
of
the
guard
if
the
ladies
were
still
inside
the
carriage
sir
they
left
at
carlisle
replied
the
guard
an
answer
literally
correct
and
yet
giving
and
intended
to
give
the
impression
that
the
ladies
had
left
the
train
at
the
station
named
well
i
wonder
who
they
were
something
unique
i
should
say
sir
quite
so
said
the
guard
as
he
left
the
door
adding
to
himself
seem
to
have
more
than
the
average
of
unique
people
this
chapter
when
richard
dalrymple
reached
barkirk
he
was
considerably
surprised
to
see
general
carriage
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
train
visitor
to
the
old
general
he
surmised
adding
under
his
breath
with
a
long
drawn
sigh
of
uncertain
meaning
really
does
look
as
if
i
was
never
to
be
allowed
to
forget
that
the
visitor
whoever
it
was
was
slow
to
alight
and
hack
drove
off
without
his
having
cleared
up
the
point
the
new
welcome
to
his
native
home
after
so
long
an
absence
was
the
heartiest
conceivable
and
so
thoroughly
was
he
taken
possession
of
that
it
looked
as
if
only
by
some
desperate
subterfuge
would
he
be
able
to
tear
himself
away
to
call
upon
the
object
of
his
affections
and
here
it
should
be
told
that
the
engagement
between
richard
dalrymple
and
miss
jeannie
farquharson
has
been
maintained
as
a
profound
secret
by
request
of
the
latter
in
order
not
to
antagonize
a
wealthy
and
cantankerous
aunt
her
sole
remaining
relative
this
state
of
affairs
had
limited
the
correspondence
between
the
two
as
their
letters
had
to
pass
through
the
hands
of
a
third
person
who
knowing
how
cruel
the
tender
mercies
of
a
gossiping
scotch
town
are
did
not
care
to
receive
too
many
lest
she
should
arouse
curiosity
and
set
too
many
tongues
wagging
at
her
own
expense
at
last
under
pretence
of
a
visit
to
his
old
friend
miss
farquharson
the
elder
richard
dalrymple
stood
in
the
drawing
room
of
laburnum
lodge
awaiting
with
a
beating
heart
the
arrival
of
his
the
servant
had
said
miss
farquharson
was
out
but
would
return
in
a
few
minutes
and
would
he
see
miss
jeannie
would
he
the
gods
were
at
last
propitious
when
the
servant
went
upstairs
to
announce
his
arrival
he
expected
to
hear
maybe
a
little
glad
cry
and
the
instant
rush
of
descending
skirts
but
no
the
house
was
still
and
after
a
minute
or
two
the
servant
returned
to
say
miss
jeannie
would
be
down
directly
for
a
moment
the
room
seemed
to
grow
chilly
but
his
face
brightened
and
the
temperature
rose
again
when
he
reminded
himself
that
no
doubt
she
had
heard
of
his
arrival
and
it
was
necessary
for
her
still
to
dissemble
her
love
before
tattling
servants
presently
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
soft
on
the
stairs
and
the
of
a
dress
gliding
downward
from
step
to
step
his
heart
beat
faster
the
color
slowly
left
his
cheek
and
a
happy
expectant
light
shone
in
his
eyes
yes
there
at
last
the
queen
of
all
his
hopes
and
joys
stood
in
the
doorway
not
indeed
the
scotch
lassie
of
his
recollection
and
his
dreams
but
a
vision
of
fair
northern
loveliness
whose
very
perfection
chained
to
his
side
the
arms
he
had
raised
to
embrace
her
and
nailed
his
feet
to
the
floor
so
that
the
passionate
embrace
of
welcome
which
he
had
so
often
rehearsed
in
his
own
mind
all
miscarried
farquharson
jeannie
my
darling
he
exclaimed
with
a
faltering
voice
regaining
control
of
himself
and
stretching
out
not
his
arms
but
his
hand
scarcely
know
you
you
have
grown
so
beautiful
what
what
have
you
done
with
my
shy
little
scotch
lassie
then
he
laid
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
looked
deep
into
her
eyes
yes
they
at
least
were
the
same
they
had
not
changed
while
he
dreamed
of
them
these
three
long
years
but
they
were
not
wont
to
droop
before
his
gaze
then
as
now
then
his
arms
stole
softly
around
the
lissom
waist
and
gently
and
almost
reverentially
he
stooped
his
lips
to
hers
please
dick
suddenly
exclaimed
the
young
lady
with
a
struggle
and
a
rapidly
rising
color
in
the
clear
brown
cheek
jeannie
dear
what
is
the
matter
queried
her
lover
in
a
distressed
tone
you
love
me
any
longer
darling
no
it
is
not
that
dick
dear
with
faltering
voice
we
have
been
parted
so
long
and
hardly
got
accustomed
to
you
yet
you
seem
so
formidable
to
me
now
remember
you
were
hardly
more
than
a
boy
when
you
left
and
now
you
have
grown
so
big
and
strong
and
it
seem
at
all
the
same
thing
to
kiss
you
darling
if
that
is
all
the
strangeness
will
soon
pass
but
dear
me
this
seems
a
cool
meeting
for
us
sit
down
dick
and
talk
things
over
replied
jeannie
taking
his
hand
and
leading
him
to
the
sofa
but
miss
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
and
they
had
only
time
to
hurriedly
appoint
a
meeting
for
the
following
day
at
the
lonely
granton
falls
when
the
elder
lady
entered
the
room
richard
mind
was
ill
at
ease
during
the
rest
of
the
day
and
he
was
glad
when
the
evening
came
around
and
he
could
have
a
confidential
chat
with
the
special
friend
and
mentor
of
his
old
school
days
alec
douglas
he
determined
to
unbosom
himself
to
his
former
and
receive
from
him
the
sweet
solace
of
his
sympathy
as
in
the
days
of
yore
when
he
knew
alec
to
be
as
true
as
steel
and
the
best
in
the
world
richard
explained
at
length
to
his
friend
his
relations
with
miss
jeannie
farquharson
but
he
was
too
much
of
a
bayard
to
allude
to
miss
infatuation
and
its
effect
upon
himself
and
his
actions
alec
douglas
sat
silent
while
his
friend
unbosomed
himself
he
interrupted
by
no
comment
but
that
he
listened
attentively
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
his
cigar
went
out
unnoticed
and
presently
fell
from
his
lips
altogether
without
awaking
his
consciousness
to
the
fact
as
his
silence
remained
unbroken
even
after
the
close
of
the
confidence
dalrymple
inquired
what
he
thought
of
the
situation
he
fancied
that
the
expression
on
his
face
lacked
the
sympathy
he
was
wont
to
express
and
yet
that
failed
to
qualify
his
astonishment
when
the
other
rose
to
his
feet
and
after
the
merest
pretence
of
looking
at
his
watch
announced
that
he
must
leave
to
keep
an
appointment
with
a
client
your
inquiry
dick
as
to
what
i
think
of
the
situation
i
say
anything
but
i
consider
that
i
am
the
last
person
you
should
ask
such
a
question
saying
which
he
strode
out
into
the
night
blest
if
i
think
everyone
has
gone
back
on
me
since
i
left
my
sweetheart
is
like
an
icicle
and
my
old
friend
is
as
chilly
as
a
norway
blizzard
i
feel
like
rip
van
winkle
who
outlived
or
outslept
all
his
friendships
did
he
mean
i
wonder
about
his
being
the
last
person
in
the
world
i
ought
to
ask
is
he
so
proud
of
his
legal
reputation
that
he
thinks
it
beneath
him
to
give
an
opinion
about
a
love
troubles
i
suppose
that
is
it
but
if
it
is
this
wretched
little
town
hardens
the
heart
worse
than
much
abused

chapter
vi
richard
dalrymple
spent
a
restless
night
and
counted
the
minutes
almost
until
it
was
time
to
meet
his
at
granton
falls
he
had
some
difficulty
in
evading
his
friends
but
finally
managed
to
be
at
the
place
of
rendezvous
some
twenty
minutes
before
the
time
fixed
the
place
appointed
was
the
corner
of
a
stone
bridge
which
spanned
the
eildon
river
at
granton
falls
the
said
falls
being
simply
a
succession
of
small
rapids
as
richard
looked
over
the
bridge
he
noticed
the
footpath
about
fifty
feet
lower
than
the
bridge
and
said
with
some
anxiety
hope
jeannie
did
not
mean
the
footpath
at
the
falls
for
if
she
goes
there
while
i
am
here
i
get
to
her
without
breaking
my
neck
over
those
at
that
instant
the
sharp
ring
of
a
hoofs
on
the
hard
granite
road
aroused
his
attention
and
turning
round
slowly
to
his
utter
bewilderment
he
saw
miss
beattison
unattended
by
her
groom
reining
in
her
horse
by
his
side
do
you
do
doctor
dalrymple
will
you
please
help
me
to
dismount
i
have
something
to
say
to
then
she
tied
her
horse
to
the
nearest
sapling
and
came
to
his
side
her
face
white
and
almost
stern
in
its
set
expression
you
wondering
how
i
came
to
be
here
well
i
came
by
the
same
train
as
you
did
to
find
out
for
myself
whether
the
secret
of
your
indifference
to
me
was
to
be
found
here
in
this
little
country
town
and
if
it
was
the
case
dear
as
i
had
heard
that
you
loved
another
why
then
i
determined
i
should
end
my
most
miserable
life
for
to
me
death
is
a
thousand
times
better
than
life
without
you
please
do
not
think
ill
of
me
for
as
heaven
is
my
witness
this
unrequited
love
is
more
than
i
can
bear
this
lonely
walk
what
does
it
mean
are
you
waiting
now
to
keep
some
appointment
as
gwendoline
beattison
stood
before
richard
dalrymple
in
all
the
pride
of
her
splendid
beauty
pleading
the
cause
of
her
own
desperate
heart
his
brain
reeled
before
this
fresh
temptation
did
the
struggle
of
all
these
long
months
and
the
resolution
displayed
in
his
flight
count
for
nothing
had
he
come
all
these
long
four
hundred
miles
only
to
capitulate
here
perish
the
thought
and
yet
his
breath
came
fast
and
faster
as
he
gazed
upon
her
and
his
eyes
faltered
and
fell
before
the
terrible
battery
of
hers
he
held
up
his
hands
palm
outward
as
a
drowning
man
who
finds
the
current
too
strong
for
him
and
murmured
me
for
sake
go
away
and
leave
that
is
what
he
meant
to
say
and
perhaps
it
is
what
he
did
say
but
every
sense
he
had
was
surrendering
to
the
irresistible
usurper
and
he
could
not
be
sure
that
even
his
speech
was
not
betraying
him
he
tried
to
think
of
jeannie
but
his
very
soul
shook
as
if
there
too
in
the
very
holy
of
holies
of
his
heart
a
traitor
was
offering
capitulation
on
the
own
terms
every
glance
was
a
temptation
to
the
stricken
man
as
gwendoline
beattison
stood
before
him
her
closely
fitting
habit
revealed
every
throb
of
the
bosom
and
told
all
too
plainly
the
tempest
which
was
convulsing
it
his
own
heart
bounded
madly
in
response
every
fibre
of
his
powerful
frame
thrilled
in
sympathy
with
the
passion
which
shook
the
voluptuous
figure
before
him
and
his
eyes
no
longer
sought
the
ground
but
alas
gré
mal
soon
outdid
hers
in
their
fiery
candor
words
failed
them
both
it
was
the
silence
of
the
duel
when
the
smallest
flash
of
the
blade
may
mean
a
life
as
deadly
was
their
silence
and
as
vital
but
their
eyes
ah
their
eyes
spoke
with
a
measureless
volume
and
thrill
which
deadened
their
ears
to
every
earthly
sound
why
you
love
me
dear
am
i
so
unattractive
that
you
must
run
away
from
me
as
gwendoline
beattison
said
this
a
wonderfully
soft
and
pathetic
look
came
into
her
beautiful
eyes
and
as
if
unable
longer
to
control
herself
she
placed
her
two
trembling
hands
on
richard
shoulders
is
it
dear
you
tell
me
and
the
voice
which
had
been
shaken
by
passion
became
strangely
gentle
and
tender
as
the
straying
hands
growing
bolder
stole
around
his
neck
and
her
beating
heart
in
dire
proximity
fired
his
own
anew
oh
jeannie
farquharson
why
do
you
not
hurry
to
the
relief
of
your
faltering
lover
true
to
you
so
long
in
the
face
of
a
desperate
temptation
but
now
alas
in
the
toils
too
late
the
perfume
which
surrounded
the
fair
temptress
like
an
atmosphere
was
in
his
nostrils
the
intoxication
of
her
gaze
mounted
to
his
brain
her
touch
thrilled
him
to
his
his
very
soul
tottered
on
its
throne
and
in
another
instant
their
lips
met
in
a
long
clinging
kiss
a
kiss
never
to
be
undone
never
to
be
forgotten
the
kiss
of
a
lifetime
after
which
man
and
woman
ought
to
die
eternally
since
in
its
rapture
they
have
beggared
paradise
the
long
ecstatic
kiss
ended
at
last
the
tumultuously
beating
feminine
heart
grew
still
the
living
throbbing
being
in
richard
arms
became
a
dead
weight
and
gwendoline
beattison
sank
back
insensible
a
victim
to
her
own
uncontrollable
emotion
dick
dick
where
are
you
i
saw
you
a
minute
such
was
the
cry
all
too
late
which
welcome
beyond
words
a
few
minutes
ago
now
sounded
like
the
knell
of
doom
in
richard
ears
placing
miss
inanimate
form
gently
against
a
mossy
knoll
our
perturbed
hero
presented
himself
over
the
wall
of
foliage
and
called
to
his
wait
there
i
will
be
with
you
in
a
stay
where
you
are
came
back
the
silvery
response
come
down
i
will
cross
the
river
on
the
stepping
stones
and
come
to
but
this
is
awful
muttered
richard
under
his
breath
will
be
here
in
three
minutes
and
will
find
miss
beattison
and
how
on
earth
can
i
explain
things
then
he
turned
his
attention
to
miss
beattison
who
was
slowly
regaining
consciousness
you
feeling
better
he
began
with
a
wonderful
softness
and
shamefacedness
in
eye
and
tone
when
suddenly
a
piercing
scream
made
him
leap
to
his
feet
and
run
to
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
god
jeannie
has
fallen
in
and
been
swept
over
the
then
he
sped
like
a
deer
across
the
bridge
down
the
sloping
bank
at
the
further
side
and
past
the
rushing
rapids
to
the
whirling
pool
where
poor
jeannie
still
partially
buoyed
up
by
her
clothes
was
whirling
around
in
the
grasp
of
the
fatal
current
chapter
vii
a
wild
thrill
of
remorse
shot
through
richard
heart
even
as
he
sprang
headlong
into
the
whirlpool
and
then
he
felt
as
if
he
was
fighting
for
his
life
in
the
embrace
of
a
hundred
this
way
and
that
the
currents
buffeted
him
fed
in
their
strength
by
the
momentum
of
the
rapids
above
until
all
the
breath
was
battered
out
of
his
body
suddenly
a
wayward
current
threw
him
against
a
projecting
rock
which
he
caught
thereby
probably
saving
his
life
a
coward
would
have
ceased
his
efforts
at
this
point
but
not
so
richard
dalrymple
once
more
the
form
of
his
sweetheart
met
his
eye
this
time
in
the
pool
beyond
gathering
himself
up
with
such
strength
as
he
had
left
he
climbed
over
the
intervening
rocks
and
again
plunged
to
the
rescue
this
time
his
effort
was
successful
with
choking
words
of
encouragement
to
cheer
his
sweetheart
who
was
fast
losing
consciousness
by
an
herculean
effort
he
swam
with
her
to
the
lower
shore
and
pushed
her
gently
before
him
on
to
the
low
bank
all
at
once
the
friendly
swirl
of
the
current
changed
and
he
was
borne
out
into
the
centre
of
the
whirlpool
again
he
caught
the
point
of
a
rock
this
time
with
his
feet
and
by
swimming
with
all
his
force
he
maintained
for
a
short
space
a
precarious
foothold
he
knew
that
in
a
very
few
minutes
his
strength
being
gone
he
must
cease
his
efforts
and
then
his
brain
seemed
to
become
cleared
as
his
strength
failed
things
are
happening
for
the
best
he
thought
as
his
arms
became
like
lead
his
feet
wavered
in
their
hold
and
a
circling
wave
caught
him
in
its
arms
and
whirled
him
off
into
the
lower
rapids
when
through
the
rush
of
water
in
his
ears
he
heard
a
loud
cry
and
his
failing
sight
caught
the
figure
of
a
woman
on
horseback
dashing
in
to
the
foaming
current
even
in
his
death
throes
his
heart
thrilled
as
he
recognized
the
form
of
miss
beattison
saladin
steady
he
heard
the
ringing
tones
he
felt
a
strong
touch
on
his
shoulder
and
then
he
was
dragged
from
the
foaming
water
out
of
the
jaws
of
death
and
on
to
the
shelving
edge
of
pebbles
which
here
replaced
the
jagged
rock
although
considerably
bruised
by
being
hurled
against
the
rock
by
the
powerful
current
none
of
richard
bones
were
broken
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
able
to
rise
to
his
feet
he
had
already
been
assured
by
miss
beattison
that
miss
farquharson
was
reviving
as
he
rose
miss
beattison
was
standing
by
the
side
of
saladin
who
was
still
panting
from
his
tremendous
fight
with
the
current
head
was
between
the
two
and
it
seemed
at
first
as
if
neither
cared
to
round
the
dangerous
point
and
meet
each
other
after
the
episode
of
the
bridge
this
time
however
the
man
was
the
bolder
and
presently
richard
dalrymple
stood
face
to
face
with
gwendoline
beattison
for
an
instant
her
eyes
met
his
with
a
startled
look
of
conscious
shyness
then
the
downward
sweep
of
the
dark
lashes
veiled
their
expression
and
only
the
faint
color
in
the
cheeks
told
of
the
agitation
beattison
you
have
saved
my
life
i
thank
you
for
it
here
he
raised
her
hand
and
gently
kissed
it
indeed
i
think
it
would
have
been
better
for
us
all
if
you
had
let
me
drown
try
to
forget
all
that
has
passed
between
us
and
permit
me
to
assist
you
to
your
saddle
i
must
go
to
miss
farquharson
is
in
good
hands
she
is
with
the
gentleman
she
is
about
to
marry
was
the
response
in
a
somewhat
uneven
tone
of
voice
can
you
mean
miss
beattison
miss
farquharson
is
engaged
to
you
exclaimed
the
other
reining
in
her
horse
abruptly
the
shock
of
your
narrow
escape
must
have
then
affected
your
brain
but
look
for
by
this
time
the
two
had
rounded
the
corner
which
hid
miss
farquharson
from
view
and
a
glance
revealed
his
friend
alec
douglas
sitting
on
a
boulder
with
his
arm
round
the
waist
of
miss
farquharson
whose
head
lay
confidingly
on
his
shoulder
for
a
moment
richard
dalrymple
stiffened
as
if
turned
into
marble
and
then
arresting
the
motion
of
his
companion
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
stepped
swiftly
over
the
noiseless
stretch
of
sand
towards
the
pair
whose
backs
were
towards
him
chapter
viii
darling
he
heard
the
voice
of
his
friend
alec
douglas
saying
should
i
have
done
if
you
had
been
drowned
my
bonnie
who
rescued
you
the
grim
listener
had
heard
the
name
of
that
little
flower
before
and
his
lip
curled
scornfully
and
bitterly
as
he
heard
it
now
applied
by
the
mouth
of
another
to
the
woman
whom
he
had
always
worshipped
as
his
own
just
for
a
moment
he
experienced
a
passing
twinge
as
a
reminder
of
the
scene
on
the
bridge
where
he
had
scarcely
proven
himself
the
knight
without
reproach
but
that
was
only
a
momentary
yielding
to
a
terrible
temptation
a
man
surrenders
very
little
in
such
an
encounter
compared
with
a
woman
thus
he
reasoned
to
himself
while
his
heart
told
him
that
such
an
argument
in
his
case
was
false
false
as
the
bottomless
pit
and
that
never
again
in
life
could
he
rebuild
against
that
besieger
on
the
bridge
the
broken
walls
and
citadel
of
his
heart
but
no
man
lessens
his
rage
at
the
defection
of
another
especially
if
that
other
is
a
woman
upon
whom
he
has
claims
simply
because
he
happens
to
be
conscious
of
a
like
personal
frailty
and
so
although
he
staggered
under
the
accusation
of
his
own
heart
richard
dalrymple
abated
not
one
whit
the
contempt
of
the
glance
he
turned
on
the
unconscious
jeannie
and
beyond
all
doubt
he
suffered
acutely
although
in
the
tumult
of
his
mind
he
was
conscious
of
wondering
why
he
did
not
suffer
more
the
treachery
of
his
sweetheart
shattered
an
idol
on
whose
worn
shrine
he
had
lavished
all
the
love
and
fealty
of
his
freshest
years
and
around
which
he
had
twined
the
fairest
garlands
which
blind
unquestioning
idolatry
can
weave
that
the
idol
he
had
worshipped
was
nobler
than
the
divinity
it
represented
goes
without
saying
where
lofty
ideal
is
unchecked
and
uncorrected
by
a
continual
comparison
with
the
original
thus
poor
jeannie
had
fallen
not
only
from
herself
but
she
had
fallen
deeper
far
from
the
high
ideal
her
lover
had
fixed
in
his
mind
badly
broken
idol
richard
dalrymple
said
in
looking
at
jeannie
and
notwithstanding
all
the
ravage
done
to
his
own
feelings
he
was
painfully
conscious
that
it
was
a
badly
damaged
idolater
too
who
looked
on
rescued
you
my
darling
repeated
alec
douglas
dear
dear
sobbed
his
companion
can
i
tell
you
the
man
who
saved
my
life
was
your
friend
richard
dalrymple
and
and
he
believes
i
am
engaged
to
be
married
to
him
oh
please
be
angry
with
me
it
was
only
a
girlish
love
which
i
have
outgrown
and
i
love
anyone
but
you
darling
i
had
not
written
to
him
for
months
and
i
thought
he
would
understand
that
i
wished
everything
to
end
between
to
the
onlooker
the
idol
seemed
more
than
broken
now
it
was
pulverized
to
very
fine
powder
indeed
a
heavy
shadow
falling
across
the
two
lovers
caused
them
to
turn
and
to
find
themselves
face
to
face
with
a
haggard
and
dishevelled
man
whose
pallid
face
and
dark
upbraiding
eye
caused
them
to
spring
hastily
to
their
feet
before
the
image
confronting
them
both
found
themselves
speechless
that
true
what
you
have
been
saying
jeannie
inquired
richard
in
a
hollow
voice
your
love
for
me
was
but
a
girlish
fancy
and
that
you
love
douglas
here
my
old
friend
alec
to
whom
i
confided
my
secret
last
night
no
answer
save
that
of
downcast
eye
and
burning
cheek
and
presently
a
glance
of
wonderful
regret
and
misery
under
the
long
level
lashes
by
both
betrothed
and
bosom
friend
have
nothing
to
say
douglas
indeed
i
have
dalrymple
replied
the
other
old
friend
bear
with
me
awhile
i
swear
to
you
i
did
not
know
of
your
engagement
until
last
night
and
as
far
as
jeannie
is
concerned
she
was
just
telling
me
that
as
she
had
not
written
you
for
so
long
she
thought
you
would
understand
that
she
wished
to
end
the
engagement
you
know
turning
softly
to
jeannie
and
laying
a
gentle
caressing
hand
on
her
head
there
is
one
thing
this
little
girl
dreads
more
than
another
it
is
anything
approaching
a
quarrel
and
she
put
off
telling
you
of
the
change
in
her
feelings
thinking
that
you
would
scold
and
make
a
dreadful
upset
about
it
of
course
the
whole
thing
is
a
terrible
mistake
all
through
but
dick
i
never
betrayed
a
friend
in
my
life
and
i
would
have
killed
myself
rather
than
have
made
love
to
your
sweetheart
if
i
had
known
at
this
the
gentle
jeannie
gave
a
scarcely
perceptible
toss
of
her
fair
head
as
if
to
say
just
shows
how
much
wiser
my
way
see
i
see
exclaimed
the
other
bitterly
have
only
my
own
blind
unsuspecting
devotion
to
thank
for
all
this
if
i
had
doubted
and
mistrusted
like
other
men
this
thing
would
never
have
happened
alec
i
bear
no
malice
you
did
not
know
jeannie
you
made
light
work
of
a
heart
that
deserved
better
from
dick
dick
please
began
jeannie
but
he
waved
her
away
leave
me
he
added
bitterly
if
i
must
do
without
your
love
at
least
spare
me
the
insult
of
your
pity
take
back
your
and
broken
coin
he
added
taking
the
and
coin
from
his
pocket
and
handing
them
to
her
still
wet
with
the
whirling
pool
from
which
he
had
saved
her
jeannie
would
have
replied
but
the
wise
alec
recognizing
that
much
must
be
allowed
to
the
disappointed
lover
motioned
her
not
to
speak
and
in
silence
they
left
as
richard
turned
on
his
heel
and
strode
away
across
the
sand
when
he
turned
he
expected
to
find
himself
if
not
face
to
face
with
at
least
within
reach
of
miss
beattison
and
the
fact
that
she
was
not
in
sight
sent
a
keen
and
to
him
mysterious
pang
to
his
heart
he
felt
he
needed
the
sympathy
of
someone
whose
tenderness
would
not
be
an
insult
and
now
the
only
being
whom
he
felt
could
have
poured
balm
on
his
wounds
had
disappeared
he
sat
down
by
the
edge
to
think
out
the
new
scheme
of
his
life
under
the
altered
conditions
of
the
morning
and
somehow
the
tumult
of
the
broken
waves
seemed
a
suitable
back
ground
to
his
thoughts
for
a
while
he
sat
in
silence
revolving
the
events
in
his
mind
and
after
a
time
he
drew
from
his
pocket
two
objects
which
we
the
readers
have
seen
before
one
was
the
photograph
of
miss
farquharson
and
the
other
the
handkerchief
found
in
the
train
the
former
blurred
and
defaced
by
the
action
of
the
water
in
his
rescue
of
miss
farquharson
caused
him
to
smile
a
sad
bitter
miserable
smile
to
which
a
tear
would
have
been
preferable
river
ends
it
all
he
said
as
he
tossed
the
photograph
into
the
torrent
almost
wish
it
had
ended
me
then
his
eye
fell
upon
the
cambric
handkerchief
found
in
the
train
and
a
warmth
seemed
to
steal
from
it
wet
and
crumpled
as
it
was
which
set
his
heart
beating
to
a
faster
measure
seems
to
me
he
said
softly
if
all
these
long
years
i
had
been
prizing
the
shell
and
neglecting
the
priceless
then
as
he
kissed
the
handkerchief
again
and
again
and
now
at
last
without
remorse
his
mind
travelled
back
to
the
scene
on
the
bridge
again
in
his
vision
there
arose
the
love
illumined
eyes
and
passionate
glance
of
the
woman
whom
he
was
fain
to
confess
now
he
had
loved
fondly
even
when
he
fled
from
her
the
passion
of
her
presence
seemed
again
to
thrill
him
as
he
sat
there
pressing
her
handkerchief
to
his
lips
and
in
the
fever
of
his
unrest
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
turned
towards
the
highway
only
to
find
himself
face
to
face
with
gwendoline
beattison
herself
for
a
moment
the
still
burning
in
his
eyes
seemed
to
surprise
and
dazzle
her
and
then
as
he
opened
wide
his
arms
and
murmured
the
one
word
she
fled
to
his
heart
with
a
glad
cry
there
eye
to
eye
heart
to
heart
and
soul
to
soul
dominion
was
restored

glancing
arrows
at
