an

children
they
are
a
nuisance
to
everyone
my
abomination
as
you
know
jack
why
on
earth
they
can
not
be
kept
out
of
sight
altogether
till
they
reach
a
sensible
age
is
what
puzzles
me
and
i
suppose
if
anything
could
make
the
matter
worse
it
is
that
this
is
a
girl
the
tone
of
disgust
with
which
the
last
word
was
uttered
brought
a
laugh
from
sir
edward
wentworth
companion
who
replied
as
he
took
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
gazed
critically
into
the
worried
perplexed
face
of
his
host
my
dear
fellow
she
is
not
of
an
age
yet
to
trouble
you
much
wait
till
she
gets
a
bit
older
when
her
education
is
finished
and
she
takes
possession
of
you
and
your
house
will
be
the
time
for
you
to
look
to
us
for
pity
look
here
sir
edward
said
a
bright
looking
youth
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
i
give
you
a
bit
of
advice
send
the
child
straight
off
to
school
is
she
coming
good
then
pack
her
off
and
keep
her
there
as
long
as
is
needful
then
i
will
go
down
and
inspect
her
and
if
she
grows
up
to
be
a
moderately
girl
i
will
do
you
a
good
turn
by
taking
her
off
your
hands
she
will
have
a
nice
little
fortune
you
informed
us
and
if
you
will
give
her
something
in
addition
out
of
gratitude
to
me
for
relieving
you
of
all
responsibility
concerning
her
upon
my
word
i
think
i
should
not
do
badly
but
sir
edward
was
not
in
a
mood
to
joke
he
looked
gloomily
around
upon
his
friends
as
they
gathered
around
the
fire
after
a
hard
day
shooting
and
remarked
i
know
what
is
before
me
i
have
seen
it
in
my
sister
family
and
have
heard
something
of
all
her
toils
and
troubles
how
thankful
i
was
when
she
and
hers
were
translated
to
australia
and
the
sea
came
between
us
it
is
first
the
nurses
who
run
off
with
one
butler
make
love
to
the
keepers
and
bring
all
kinds
of
followers
about
the
house
who
sometimes
make
off
with
one
plate
then
it
the
governesses
who
come
and
have
a
try
at
the
guests
or
most
likely
in
my
case
they
would
set
their
affections
on
me
and
get
the
reins
of
government
entirely
into
their
hands
if
it
is
school
then
there
is
a
mass
of
correspondence
about
the
child
health
and
training
and
in
addition
i
shall
have
all
the
ladies
in
the
neighborhood
coming
to
mother
the
child
and
tell
me
how
to
train
it
it
is
a
bad
for
me
i
can
tell
you
and
not
one
of
you
would
care
to
be
in
my
shoes
what
is
the
trouble
ned
asked
a
opening
the
door
and
glancing
at
the
amused
faces
of
those
surrounding
sir
edward
all
of
whom
seemed
to
be
keenly
enjoying
their
host
perplexity
he
has
received
a
legacy
that
is
all
was
the
response
he
has
had
an
orphan
niece
and
nurse
sent
to
him
from
some
remote
place
in
the
highlands
come
give
us
your
case
again
old
fellow
for
the
benefit
of
your
cousin
sir
edward
a
grave
man
with
an
moustache
and
dark
piercing
eyes
looked
up
with
a
desponding
shake
of
the
head
and
repeated
slowly
and
emphatically
a
widowed
sister
of
mine
died
last
year
and
left
her
little
girl
in
the
charge
of
an
old
school
friend
who
has
now
taken
a
husband
to
herself
and
discarded
the
child
calmly
sending
me
the
following
letter
sir
doubtless
you
will
remember
that
your
sister
great
desire
on
her
was
that
you
should
receive
her
little
one
and
bring
her
up
under
your
own
eye
being
her
natural
guardian
and
nearest
relative
hearing
however
from
you
that
you
did
not
at
that
time
feel
equal
to
the
responsibility
i
came
forward
and
volunteered
to
take
her
for
a
short
while
till
you
had
made
arrangements
to
receive
her
i
have
been
expecting
to
hear
from
you
for
some
time
and
as
i
have
promised
my
future
husband
to
fix
the
day
for
our
marriage
some
time
early
next
month
i
thought
i
could
not
do
better
than
send
the
child
with
her
nurse
to
you
without
delay
she
will
reach
you
the
day
after
you
receive
this
letter
perhaps
you
will
kindly
send
me
word
of
her
safe
arrival
yours
truly
anna
kent
now
lovell
what
do
you
think
of
that
and
sure
enough
this
afternoon
while
we
were
out
the
child
and
nurse
appeared
and
are
in
the
house
at
this
present
moment
do
you
think
it
a
hard
case
for
such
a
confirmed
bachelor
as
i
am
i
do
indeed
was
the
hearty
reply
but
i
think
you
will
find
a
way
out
of
it
ned
take
a
wife
unto
yourself
and
she
will
relieve
you
of
all
responsibility
there
was
a
general
laugh
at
this
but
in
the
midst
of
it
the
door
slowly
opened
and
the
subject
of
all
this
discussion
appeared
on
the
threshold
a
fragile
little
figure
with
long
hair
and
a
pair
of
dark
brown
eyes
that
looked
calmly
and
searchingly
in
front
of
her
clad
in
white
with
her
dimpled
hands
crossed
in
front
of
her
she
stood
there
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
spoke
where
is
my
uncle
edward
here
replied
sir
edward
as
he
looked
helplessly
round
first
at
his
friends
and
then
at
his
small
niece
the
child
stepped
up
to
him
with
perfect
composure
and
held
out
her
little
hand
which
her
uncle
took
undergoing
all
the
while
a
severe
scrutiny
from
the
pair
of
dark
eyes
fixed
upon
him
there
was
dead
silence
in
the
room
sir
edward
companions
were
delighting
in
the
scene
and
his
great
discomfiture
only
heightened
their
enjoyment
well
he
said
at
length
rather
feebly
i
think
you
know
the
look
of
me
now
do
you
where
is
your
nurse
ought
you
not
to
be
in
your
bed
this
is
not
the
place
for
little
girls
you
know
i
was
thinking
you
would
kiss
me
and
the
child
lips
began
to
quiver
while
a
pink
flush
rose
to
her
cheeks
and
she
glanced
wistfully
round
in
the
hope
of
seeing
some
sympathetic
face
near
her
but
sir
edward
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
this
laying
his
hand
on
the
curly
head
raised
to
his
he
patted
it
as
he
might
his
dog
and
said
there
there
now
you
have
introduced
yourself
to
me
you
can
run
away
what
is
your
name
millicent
is
it
milly
is
my
name
and
are
all
these
gentlemen
my
uncles
too
the
tone
of
doubtful
inquiry
was
too
much
for
the
little
company
and
milly
question
was
answered
by
a
shout
of
laughter
again
the
child
face
flushed
and
then
a
man
stepped
forward
come
wentworth
this
is
a
severe
ordeal
for
such
a
mite
i
have
grandchildren
of
my
own
so
am
not
so
scared
as
you
now
little
one
is
that
better
and
in
an
instant
the
child
was
lifted
by
him
and
placed
upon
his
knee
as
he
took
a
seat
by
the
fire
milly
heaved
a
short
sigh
i
like
this
she
said
looking
up
at
him
confidingly
does
uncle
edward
really
want
me
to
go
to
bed
nurse
said
it
was
time
yet
nurse
wanted
her
supper
so
she
sent
me
in
here
while
she
had
it
the
reign
of
the
nurse
has
begun
said
sir
edward
well
it
may
be
a
very
fine
joke
to
all
you
fellows
but
if
i
do
make
my
authority
felt
at
once
it
will
be
all
up
with
me
lovell
be
so
good
as
to
ring
that
bell
sir
edward
voice
was
irate
when
his
old
butler
appeared
ford
take
this
child
to
her
nurse
and
tell
her
that
she
is
never
to
appear
in
my
presence
again
unless
sent
for
now
millicent
go
at
once
the
child
slid
down
from
her
seat
but
though
evidently
puzzled
at
the
quick
sharp
words
she
seemed
to
have
no
fear
for
going
up
to
her
uncle
she
slipped
her
little
hand
into
his
are
you
angry
uncle
what
does
mean
will
you
say
god
bless
you
to
me
with
the
baby
fingers
clinging
to
his
what
could
sir
edward
say
child
now
go
say
bless
you
persisted
the
little
one
and
it
was
not
till
her
uncle
muttered
the
desired
words
that
she
relinquished
her
hold
and
followed
the
butler
sedately
out
of
the
room
chapter
ii
david
and
goliath
sir
edward
wentworth
was
as
he
expressed
it
a
confirmed
bachelor
and
though
during
the
autumn
months
he
was
quite
willing
to
fill
his
house
with
his
london
friends
he
was
better
pleased
to
live
the
greater
part
of
the
year
in
seclusion
occupying
himself
with
looking
after
his
estate
and
writing
articles
for
several
of
the
leading
reviews
of
the
day
the
advent
of
his
small
niece
was
indeed
a
great
trial
to
him
but
with
his
characteristic
thoroughness
he
determined
that
he
would
make
the
necessary
arrangements
for
her
comfort
accordingly
he
had
a
long
interview
with
her
nurse
the
following
morning
it
proved
to
be
satisfactory
the
nurse
was
a
staid
elderly
woman
who
assured
him
she
was
accustomed
to
the
sole
charge
of
the
child
and
would
keep
her
entirely
under
her
own
control
i
expect
you
would
like
her
to
be
sent
down
to
you
in
the
evening
at
dessert
perhaps
sir
she
inquired
sir
edward
pulled
the
ends
of
his
moustache
dubiously
is
it
necessary
i
thought
children
ought
to
be
in
bed
at
that
time
of
course
it
shall
be
as
you
like
sir
you
do
not
dine
so
late
as
some
do
i
thought
you
would
expect
to
see
her
once
in
the
day
after
a
little
hesitation
sir
edward
gave
his
permission
and
when
he
found
that
milly
neither
screamed
nor
snatched
for
the
fruit
on
the
table
and
did
not
herself
engross
the
whole
conversation
he
became
quite
reconciled
to
the
little
white
figure
stealing
in
and
occupying
the
chair
that
was
always
placed
at
his
side
for
her
beyond
this
he
saw
very
little
of
her
while
his
guests
were
with
him
but
afterwards
when
they
had
all
left
him
and
he
relapsed
into
his
ordinary
life
he
was
constantly
coming
across
her
sometimes
he
would
find
her
in
the
stables
her
arms
round
the
stable
cat
and
the
grooms
holding
a
voluble
conversation
with
her
or
among
the
cows
at
the
bottom
of
the
paddock
or
feeding
the
pigs
and
fowls
in
the
poultry
yard
generally
she
was
attended
by
fritz
a
beautiful
collie
who
had
with
the
fickleness
of
his
nature
transferred
his
affection
from
his
master
to
her
and
though
uncertain
in
temper
towards
most
was
never
anything
but
amiable
when
with
the
little
girl
her
uncle
form
approaching
was
quite
a
sufficient
hint
to
her
to
make
herself
scarce
she
would
generally
anticipate
the
usual
formula
now
run
away
child
to
nurse
by
singing
out
cheerfully
i
am
just
off
uncle
and
by
the
time
he
had
reached
the
spot
where
she
was
standing
the
little
figure
would
be
running
off
in
the
distance
fritz
close
at
her
heels
one
afternoon
sir
edward
was
returning
from
a
stroll
up
the
avenue
when
he
saw
the
child
at
play
among
the
trees
and
for
a
moment
he
paused
and
watched
her
she
appeared
to
be
very
busy
with
a
doll
wrapped
in
a
fur
rug
which
she
carefully
deposited
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
then
for
some
minutes
she
and
fritz
seemed
to
be
having
a
kind
of
a
game
of
hide
and
seek
with
one
another
until
she
pushed
him
into
a
bush
and
commanded
him
to
stay
there
suddenly
dog
and
child
darted
at
each
other
and
then
to
sir
edward
amazement
he
saw
his
little
niece
seize
fritz
by
the
throat
and
bring
him
to
the
ground
when
both
were
rolling
over
one
another
and
fritz
short
sharp
barks
became
rather
indignant
in
tone
as
he
vainly
tried
to
escape
from
the
little
hands
so
tightly
round
him
sir
edward
thought
it
high
time
to
interfere
millicent
he
called
out
sharply
come
to
me
at
once
what
are
you
doing
in
an
instant
milly
was
upon
her
feet
and
lifting
a
hot
flushed
little
face
to
his
she
placed
herself
in
her
favorite
attitude
when
in
his
presence
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
back
and
feet
closely
planted
together
do
you
know
fritz
might
bite
if
you
are
so
rough
with
him
were
you
trying
to
choke
him
demanded
her
uncle
yes
she
responded
breathless
from
her
late
exertions
i
was
trying
to
kill
him
he
a
bear
and
that
my
lamb
and
i
am
david
all
a
child
games
were
beyond
sir
edward
comprehension
he
looked
down
upon
her
with
a
knitted
brow
she
continued
you
see
he
has
to
do
for
both
a
bear
and
a
lion
for
they
both
came
and
they
both
tried
to
get
the
lamb
nurse
was
the
lion
one
day
but
she
is
too
big
i
ca
knock
her
down
though
i
try
hard
i
will
not
have
fritz
knocked
down
in
that
fashion
he
might
hurt
you
said
sir
edward
sternly
milly
looked
sorrowful
then
brightening
up
she
asked
but
i
may
kill
goliath
may
i
do
you
know
that
is
one
of
my
games
see
i
david
and
you
see
that
big
old
tree
standing
by
itself
goliath
he
is
looking
at
me
now
do
you
see
where
his
eyes
come
just
up
there
in
those
first
branches
when
it
windy
he
shakes
his
head
at
me
fearful
he
a
wicked
wicked
old
thing
and
he
thinks
no
one
can
knock
him
down
do
you
remember
about
him
uncle
sir
edward
was
becoming
slightly
interested
he
leaned
against
a
tree
and
took
out
a
cigar
no
i
do
think
i
do
he
said
do
you
remember
he
stood
up
so
proud
and
called
out
a
man
to
come
and
fight
me
he
saying
that
to
me
now
i
david
you
know
and
i
going
just
wait
a
moment
till
i
ready
she
darted
away
to
where
her
doll
was
and
soon
returned
with
a
tiny
calico
bag
which
she
opened
very
carefully
and
disclosed
to
her
puzzled
gaze
five
round
stones
you
see
she
went
on
it
a
pity
i
have
a
sling
but
tom
in
the
stable
says
he
will
make
me
a
cattypot
that
a
lovely
sling
he
says
which
would
kill
anything
but
it
all
right
i
pretend
i
have
a
sling
you
know
now
you
wait
here
i
going
to
meet
him
i
not
a
bit
afraid
though
he
looks
so
big
because
david
was
you
know
god
helped
him
now
goliath
i
ready
sir
edward
looked
on
in
some
amusement
as
milly
stepped
out
with
regular
even
steps
until
she
was
about
twenty
feet
from
the
tree
then
suddenly
stopped
i
hear
what
you
say
goliath
you
say
you
give
my
body
to
be
pecked
at
and
eaten
by
the
birds
but
you
wo
do
that
for
i
am
coming
and
i
am
going
to
kill
you
and
then
with
all
her
strength
the
child
flung
her
stones
one
by
one
at
the
tree
pausing
for
some
moments
when
she
had
done
so
he
quite
dead
uncle
she
said
calmly
as
she
retraced
her
steps
and
stood
before
sir
edward
again
looking
up
at
him
with
those
earnest
eyes
of
hers
quite
dead
and
if
i
had
a
sword
i
would
play
at
cutting
off
his
head
i
suppose
you
would
lend
me
your
sword
hanging
up
in
the
hall
would
you
most
certainly
not
was
the
quick
reply
then
taking
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
sir
edward
asked
and
does
all
your
play
consist
in
killing
people
i
only
try
to
kill
the
bear
and
lion
and
goliath
because
they
so
wicked
and
so
strong
milly
continued
this
is
such
a
lovely
place
to
play
in
trees
are
so
nice
to
have
games
with
shall
i
tell
you
some
more
do
you
see
that
little
tree
over
there
that
where
i
sit
when
i
the
probable
son
and
when
i
sat
there
a
long
time
and
been
very
miserable
and
eaten
some
of
the
beech
nuts
that
do
for
husks
then
suddenly
i
think
i
will
go
home
to
my
father
it
rather
a
long
walk
but
i
get
happier
and
happier
as
i
go
and
i
get
to
walk
very
quick
at
last
and
then
i
run
when
i
see
my
father
do
you
see
that
nice
big
old
tree
right
up
there
with
the
red
leaves
uncle
that
him
and
i
run
up
and
say
i
have
sinned
i
am
not
fit
to
come
back
but
i
am
so
sorry
that
i
left
you
and
then
i
just
hug
him
and
kiss
him
and
do
you
know
i
feel
he
hugs
and
kisses
me
back
he
does
in
the
story
you
know
and
then
i
have
a
nice
little
feast
all
ready
i
get
some
biscuits
from
nurse
and
a
little
jam
and
some
sugar
and
water
and
i
sit
down
and
feel
so
happy
to
think
i
not
the
probable
son
any
more
and
have
got
to
eat
husks
or
be
with
the
pigs
do
you
think
that
a
beautiful
game
uncle
do
you
get
all
your
games
from
the
bible
inquired
sir
edward
i
somehow
think
it
is
not
quite
correct
and
he
looked
very
dubiously
at
his
little
niece
as
he
spoke
well
said
milly
the
earnest
look
coming
into
her
eyes
again
i
love
the
bible
so
much
you
see
nurse
tells
me
the
stories
ever
so
often
and
i
know
lots
and
lots
of
them
but
i
like
the
probable
son
the
best
do
you
like
it
sir
edward
replaced
his
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
strolled
on
without
a
reply
his
little
niece
words
awakened
very
uncomfortable
feelings
within
his
heart
years
before
he
had
known
and
loved
his
bible
well
he
had
been
active
in
christian
work
and
had
borne
many
a
scoff
and
jeer
from
his
companions
when
at
oxford
for
being
pious
as
they
termed
it
but
there
came
a
time
when
coldness
crept
into
his
christianity
and
worldly
ambition
and
desires
filled
his
soul
gradually
he
wandered
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
right
path
and
when
he
came
into
his
property
he
took
possession
of
it
with
no
other
aim
and
object
in
life
than
to
enjoy
himself
in
his
own
way
and
to
totally
ignore
both
the
past
and
future
beyond
going
to
church
once
on
sunday
he
made
no
profession
of
religion
but
that
custom
he
conformed
to
most
regularly
and
the
vicar
of
the
parish
had
nothing
to
complain
of
in
the
way
in
which
his
appeals
for
charity
were
met
by
the
squire
it
is
needless
to
say
that
sir
edward
was
not
a
happy
man
there
were
times
when
he
could
not
bear
his
own
thoughts
and
the
solitude
of
his
position
and
at
such
times
there
was
a
hasty
departure
for
town
and
some
weeks
of
club
life
ensued
after
which
he
would
return
to
his
home
and
engross
himself
in
both
his
literary
and
country
occupations
with
fresh
vigor
chapter
iii
the
first
punishment
slowly
but
surely
little
milly
was
advancing
in
her
uncle
favor
her
extreme
docility
and
great
fearlessness
added
to
her
quaintness
of
speech
and
action
attracted
him
greatly
he
became
interested
in
watching
her
little
figure
as
it
flitted
to
and
fro
and
the
sunny
laugh
and
bright
childish
voice
about
the
house
were
no
longer
an
annoyance
to
him
one
day
he
was
moved
to
anger
by
an
accident
that
happened
to
a
small
statue
in
the
hall
and
milly
was
the
delinquent
her
ball
had
rolled
behind
it
and
both
she
and
the
dog
were
having
a
romp
to
get
it
when
in
the
scuffle
the
statue
came
to
the
ground
and
lay
there
in
a
thousand
pieces
hearing
the
crash
sir
edward
came
out
of
his
study
and
completely
losing
his
temper
he
turned
furiously
upon
the
child
giving
vent
to
language
that
was
hardly
fit
for
her
ears
to
hear
she
stood
before
him
with
round
frightened
eyes
and
quivering
lips
her
little
figure
upright
and
still
until
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
then
she
turned
and
fled
from
him
through
the
garden
door
out
upon
the
smooth
grassy
lawn
where
she
flung
herself
down
face
foremost
close
to
her
favorite
beech
tree
there
giving
way
to
a
burst
of
passionate
tears
i
did
mean
it
oh
i
did
mean
to
break
it
she
sobbed
aloud
uncle
edward
is
a
fearful
angry
man
he
does
love
me
a
bit
i
wish
i
had
a
father
i
want
a
father
like
the
probable
son
he
would
be
so
angry
and
when
later
on
nurse
came
with
an
anxious
face
to
fetch
her
little
charge
in
from
the
cold
wet
grass
she
had
not
the
heart
to
scold
her
for
the
face
was
raised
so
pitifully
to
hers
with
the
words
oh
nurse
dear
carry
me
in
your
arms
no
one
loves
me
here
i
been
telling
god
all
about
it
he
the
only
one
that
is
angry
that
evening
at
the
accustomed
time
milly
stole
quietly
into
the
wondering
in
her
little
heart
whether
her
uncle
was
still
angry
with
her
as
she
climbed
into
her
chair
now
placed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
large
table
she
eyed
him
doubtfully
through
her
long
eyelashes
then
gathering
courage
from
the
immovable
expression
of
his
face
she
said
in
her
most
cheerful
tone
it
a
very
fine
night
uncle
is
it
responded
sir
edward
who
was
accustomed
by
this
time
to
some
such
remark
when
his
little
niece
wanted
to
attract
his
notice
then
feeling
really
ashamed
of
his
outburst
a
few
hours
before
he
said
by
way
of
excusing
himself
look
here
millicent
you
made
me
exceedingly
angry
by
your
piece
of
mischief
this
afternoon
that
statue
can
never
be
replaced
and
you
have
destroyed
one
of
my
most
valuable
possessions
let
it
be
a
warning
for
the
future
if
ever
you
break
anything
again
i
shall
punish
you
most
severely
do
you
understand
yes
uncle
she
answered
looking
up
earnestly
will
punish
me
severely
i
will
remember
i
have
been
wondering
why
i
broke
it
when
i
did
mean
to
do
it
nurse
says
it
was
a
most
accident
i
asked
her
what
an
accident
was
she
says
it
a
thing
that
happens
when
you
do
expect
it
a
surprise
she
called
it
i
sure
it
was
a
dreadful
surprise
to
me
and
to
fritz
too
but
i
never
play
ball
in
the
hall
again
a
week
later
and
sir
edward
was
in
his
study
absorbed
in
his
books
and
papers
when
there
was
a
knock
at
his
door
and
to
his
astonishment
his
little
niece
walked
in
this
was
so
against
all
rules
and
regulations
that
his
voice
was
very
stern
as
he
said
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
intrusion
millicent
you
know
you
are
never
allowed
to
disturb
me
when
here
milly
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
she
walked
up
to
her
uncle
her
small
lips
tightly
closed
and
then
standing
in
front
of
him
with
clasped
hands
she
said
i
come
to
tell
you
some
dreadful
news
sir
edward
pushed
aside
his
papers
adjusted
his
glasses
and
saw
from
the
pallor
of
the
child
face
and
the
scared
expression
in
her
eyes
that
it
was
no
light
matter
that
had
made
her
venture
into
his
presence
uncalled
for
it
a
dreadful
surprise
again
milly
continued
but
i
told
nurse
i
must
tell
you
at
once
i
i
felt
so
bad
here
and
her
little
hand
was
laid
pathetically
on
her
chest
well
what
is
it
out
with
it
child
you
are
wasting
my
time
said
her
uncle
impatiently
i
have
i
have
broken
something
else
there
was
silence
then
sir
edward
asked
drily
and
what
is
it
now
it
a
a
that
the
gardener
boy
left
outside
the
i
i
well
i
put
it
on
fritz
head
for
a
hat
you
know
he
did
look
so
funny
but
he
tossed
up
his
head
and
ran
away
and
it
fell
and
it
is
smashed
to
bits
i
have
got
the
bits
outside
the
door
on
the
mat
shall
i
bring
them
in
a
was
of
such
small
value
in
sir
edward
eyes
that
he
almost
smiled
at
the
child
distress
well
well
you
must
learn
not
to
touch
the
in
future
now
run
away
and
do
not
disturb
me
again
but
milly
stood
her
ground
i
think
you
have
forgot
uncle
edward
you
told
me
that
if
i
broke
anything
again
you
would
punish
me
severely
those
were
the
words
you
said
do
you
remember
sir
edward
pulled
the
ends
of
his
moustache
and
fidgeted
uneasily
in
his
chair
he
always
prided
himself
upon
being
a
man
of
his
word
but
much
regretted
at
the
present
moment
that
he
had
been
so
rash
in
his
speech
oh
ah
i
remember
he
said
at
length
meeting
his
little
anxious
gaze
with
some
embarrassment
then
pulling
himself
together
he
added
sternly
of
course
you
must
be
punished
it
was
exceedingly
careless
and
mischievous
what
does
your
nurse
do
when
she
punishes
you
she
never
does
punish
me
not
now
said
milly
plaintively
when
i
was
a
very
little
girl
i
used
to
stand
in
the
corner
i
do
think
nurse
has
punished
me
for
years
sir
edward
was
in
a
dilemma
children
punishments
were
quite
unknown
to
him
milly
seemed
to
guess
at
his
difficulty
how
were
you
punished
when
you
were
a
little
boy
uncle
i
used
to
be
well
thrashed
many
is
the
whipping
that
i
have
had
from
my
father
what
is
a
whipping
like
you
gave
fritz
when
he
went
into
the
game
wood
yes
there
was
a
pause
the
child
clasped
her
little
hands
tighter
and
set
her
lips
firmer
as
she
saw
before
her
eyes
a
strong
arm
dealing
very
heavy
strokes
with
a
then
she
said
in
an
tone
and
do
you
think
that
is
how
you
had
better
punish
me
sir
edward
smiled
grimly
as
he
looked
at
the
baby
figure
standing
so
erect
before
him
no
he
said
i
do
not
think
you
are
a
fit
subject
for
that
kind
of
treatment
milly
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
and
do
you
know
how
to
punish
she
said
after
some
minutes
of
awkward
silence
there
was
commiseration
in
her
tone
the
situation
was
becoming
ludicrous
to
sir
edward
though
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
annoyance
at
feeling
his
inability
to
carry
out
his
threat
nurse
told
me
continued
his
little
niece
gravely
that
she
knew
a
little
boy
who
was
shut
up
in
a
dark
cupboard
for
a
punishment
but
he
was
found
nearly
dead
and
really
died
the
next
day
from
fright
there
is
a
dark
cupboard
on
the
kitchen
stairs
i
do
think
i
should
be
very
frightened
because
god
will
be
in
there
with
me
do
you
think
that
would
do
this
was
not
acceptable
the
child
went
on
with
knitted
brows
i
expect
the
bible
will
tell
you
how
to
punish
i
remember
a
man
who
picked
up
sticks
on
sunday
he
was
stoned
dead
and
elisha
servant
was
made
a
leper
and
some
children
were
killed
by
a
bear
and
a
prophet
by
a
lion
and
annas
and
sophia
were
struck
dead
all
of
them
were
punished
severely
were
they
if
you
forgave
me
a
little
bit
and
left
out
the
severely
it
would
make
it
easier
i
expect
perhaps
i
might
do
that
said
poor
sir
edward
who
by
this
time
longed
to
dispense
with
the
punishment
altogether
as
it
was
only
a
i
will
leave
out
the
severely
milly
face
brightened
i
think
she
said
coming
up
to
him
and
laying
one
hand
on
his
knee
i
think
if
i
were
to
go
to
bed
instead
of
coming
down
to
dessert
with
you
this
evening
that
would
punish
me
do
you
think
so
very
well
that
will
do
now
run
away
and
let
this
be
your
last
breakage
i
can
not
be
worried
with
your
punishments
i
will
try
to
be
very
good
nurse
always
said
milly
while
being
tucked
up
in
bed
that
night
because
uncle
edward
is
very
puzzled
when
he
has
to
punish
me
he
does
know
what
to
do
he
looked
quite
unhappy
and
said
it
worried
him
and
sir
edward
as
he
finished
his
dinner
in
silence
and
solitude
muttered
to
himself
that
child
is
certainly
a
great
nuisance
at
times
but
upon
my
word
i
quite
miss
her
this
evening
children
after
all
are
original
if
they
are
nothing
else
and
she
is
one
of
the
most
original
that
i
have
ever
met
it
was
sunday
morning
and
sir
edward
was
just
starting
for
church
as
he
stood
over
the
blazing
fire
in
the
hall
buttoning
a
glove
a
little
voice
came
to
him
from
the
staircase
uncle
edward
may
i
come
down
and
speak
to
you
permission
being
given
milly
danced
down
the
stairs
and
then
slipping
her
little
hand
into
her
uncle
she
lifted
a
coaxing
face
to
his
will
you
take
me
to
church
with
you
nurse
thinks
i
almost
big
enough
now
and
i
have
been
to
church
in
the
afternoon
sometimes
sir
edward
hesitated
if
you
come
you
will
fidget
i
expect
i
can
not
stand
that
i
will
sit
as
still
as
a
mouse
i
wo
fidget
if
you
behave
badly
i
shall
never
take
you
again
yes
you
may
come
be
quick
and
get
ready
a
few
moments
after
sir
edward
and
his
little
niece
were
walking
down
the
avenue
she
clasping
a
large
bible
under
her
arm
and
trying
in
vain
to
match
her
steps
with
his
the
squire
pew
was
one
of
the
high
ones
and
head
did
not
reach
the
top
of
it
very
quiet
and
silent
she
was
during
the
service
and
very
particular
to
follow
her
uncle
example
in
every
respect
though
she
nearly
upset
his
gravity
at
the
outset
by
taking
off
her
hat
in
imitation
of
him
and
covering
her
face
with
it
but
when
the
sermon
commenced
her
large
dark
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
clergyman
as
he
gave
out
the
text
so
well
known
to
her
will
arise
and
go
to
my
father
and
will
say
unto
him
father
i
have
sinned
against
heaven
and
before
thee
and
am
no
more
worthy
to
be
called
thy
and
though
the
sermon
was
half
an
hour
in
length
her
gaze
never
left
the
pulpit
uncle
edward
she
said
when
their
steps
at
length
turned
homewards
do
you
know
i
heard
all
the
sermon
and
understood
it
pretty
well
except
the
long
words
was
it
nice
to
hear
about
the
probable
son
you
mean
can
not
you
pronounce
your
words
properly
sir
edward
tone
was
irritable
he
had
not
been
feeling
very
comfortable
under
the
good
vicar
words
i
ca
say
that
i
always
forget
it
nurse
says
one
long
word
is
as
good
as
another
sometimes
uncle
what
did
the
clergyman
mean
by
people
running
away
from
god
no
one
does
do
they
a
great
many
do
was
the
dry
response
but
how
can
they
because
god
is
everywhere
no
one
ca
get
away
from
god
and
why
do
they
want
to
because
god
loves
them
so
why
did
the
prodigal
want
to
get
away
milly
considered
i
he
wanted
to
have
some
a
aventures
do
you
call
them
i
play
at
that
you
know
all
sorts
of
things
happen
to
me
before
i
sit
down
at
the
beech
tree
but

it
so
different
with
god

should
be
fearful

from
him

could

i
uncle
who
would
take
care
of
me
and
love
me
when

who
would
listen
to
my
prayers

uncle

i
think
i
should
die
of
fright
if
i
got

from
god

tell
me

could
milly
had
stopped
short
and
grasped
hold
of
sir
edward
coat
in
her
growing
excitement
he
glanced
at
her
flushed
cheeks
and
sparkling
eyes
you
foolish
child
there
is
no
fear
of
your
getting
away
from
god
do
be
so
excitable
we
will
change
the
subject
i
want
to
see
maxwell
so
we
will
go
through
the
wood
maxwell
was
sir
edward
head
and
a
little
later
found
them
at
his
pretty
cottage
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
it
was
milly
first
visit
and
maxwell
a
body
greeted
her
with
such
a
sunshiny
smile
that
the
child
drew
near
to
her
instinctively
what
a
lovely
room
she
exclaimed
looking
round
the
homely
little
kitchen
with
a
child
admiring
eyes
and
what
a
beautiful
cat
may
i
stroke
her
assent
being
given
milly
was
soon
seated
in
a
large
cushioned
chair
a
fat
tabby
cat
on
her
lap
and
while
sir
edward
was
occupied
with
his
keeper
she
was
making
fast
friends
with
the
wife
uncle
edward
she
said
when
they
had
taken
their
leave
and
were
walking
homewards
maxwell
has
asked
me
to
go
to
tea
with
her
may
i
all
by
myself
ask
your
nurse
i
have
no
objection
i
should
love
to
live
in
her
house
continued
the
child
eagerly
it
is
all
among
the
trees
and
i
love
trees
and
this
wood
is
so
lovely
why
i
might
get
lost
in
it
might
i
i
have
never
been
here
before
in
my
children
always
get
lost
in
a
wood
uncle
edward
do
you
think
the
trees
talk
to
one
another
i
always
think
they
do
look
at
them
now
they
are
just
shaking
their
heads
together
and
whispering
are
they
whispering
very
gently
because
it
is
sunday
sometimes
they
get
angry
with
one
another
and
scream
but
i
like
to
hear
them
hum
and
sing
best
nurse
says
it
the
wind
that
makes
them
do
it
do
you
like
to
hear
them
when
i
lie
in
bed
i
listen
to
them
around
the
house
and
i
always
want
to
sing
with
them
nurse
does
like
it
she
says
it
the
wind
moaning
i
think
it
the
trees
singing
to
god
and
i
love
them
when
they
do
it
which
do
you
think
it
is
and
so
milly
chatted
on
and
sir
edward
listened
and
put
in
a
word
or
two
occasionally
and
on
the
whole
did
not
find
his
small
niece
bad
company
he
told
her
when
they
entered
the
house
that
she
could
go
to
church
every
sunday
morning
in
future
with
him
and
that
sent
milly
to
the
nursery
with
a
radiant
face
there
to
confide
to
nurse
that
she
had
had
a
lovely
time
and
was
going
to
tea
as
often
as
she
might
with
maxwell
in
the
wood
chapter
iv
maxwell
sorrow
milly
spent
a
very
happy
afternoon
at
the
keeper
cottage
the
next
day
and
came
down
to
dessert
in
the
evening
so
full
of
her
visit
that
she
could
talk
of
nothing
else
they
were
so
kind
to
me
uncle
maxwell
made
a
hot
currant
cake
on
purpose
for
me
and
the
cat
had
a
red
ribbon
for
company
and
we
sat
by
the
fire
and
talked
when
maxwell
was
out
and
she
told
me
such
lovely
stories
and
i
saw
a
beautiful
picture
of
the
probable
son
in
the
best
parlor
and
maxwell
took
it
down
and
let
me
have
a
good
look
at
it
i
am
going
to
save
up
my
money
and
buy
one
just
like
it
for
my
nursery
and
do
you
know
uncle
she
stopped
short
but
not
for
want
of
breath
putting
her
curly
head
on
one
side
she
surveyed
her
uncle
for
a
minute
meditatively
then
asked
a
little
doubtfully
can
you
keep
a
secret
uncle
edward
because
i
would
like
to
tell
you
only
you
see
maxwell
does
talk
about
it
and
i
told
her
i
would
at
least
not
to
the
servants
you
know
i
think
you
can
trust
me
sir
edward
said
gravely
this
is
it
then
and
i
think
it
so
wonderful
they
have
got
a
real
live
probable
son
sir
edward
raised
his
eyebrows
his
little
niece
continued
yes
they
really
have
it
was
when
i
was
talking
about
the
picture
maxwell
took
the
corner
of
her
apron
and
wiped
her
eyes
and
said
she
had
a
dear
son
who
had
run
away
from
home
and
she
had
seen
him
for
nine
years
just
fancy
where
was
i
nine
years
ago
not
born
but
i
must
have
been
somewhere
and
milly
active
little
brain
now
started
another
train
of
thought
until
she
got
fairly
bewildered
i
expect
i
was
fast
asleep
in
god
arms
she
said
at
length
with
knitted
brows
only
of
course
i
do
remember
and
having
settled
that
point
to
her
satisfaction
she
continued
her
story
maxwell
son
is
called
tommy
he
ran
away
when
he
was
seventeen
because
he
did
like
the
blacksmith
shop
maxwell
and
i
cried
about
him
he
had
such
curly
hair
and
stood
six
feet
in
his
stockings
and
he
was
a
baby
when
he
was
little
and
had
croup
and
and
confusions
and
did
come
to
for
four
hours
but
he
would
run
away
though
he
laid
the
fire
and
put
sticks
on
it
and
drew
the
water
for
maxwell
before
he
went
and
maxwell
says
he
may
be
a
soldier
or
a
sailor
now
for
all
she
knows
and
he
may
be
drownded
dead
or
run
over
or
have
both
his
legs
shot
to
pieces
or
he
may
be
in
india
with
the
blacks
but
i
told
her
he
was
very
likely
taking
care
of
some
pigs
somewhere
and
she
got
happy
a
little
bit
then
and
we
dried
our
tears
and
she
gave
me
some
peppermint
to
suck
is
it
a
wonderful
story
uncle
very
wonderful
was
the
response
well
we
were
in
the
middle
of
talking
when
maxwell
came
in
so
we
hushed
because
maxwell
said
makes
my
man
so
sad
but
do
you
know
when
maxwell
was
bringing
me
home
through
the
wood
he
asked
me
what
we
had
been
talking
about
and
he
said
he
knew
it
was
about
the
boy
because
he
could
see
it
in
maxwell
eye
and
then
i
asked
him
if
he
would
run
and
kiss
tommy
when
he
came
back
and
if
he
would
make
a
feast
and
he
said
he
would
do
anything
to
get
him
home
again
milly
paused
then
said
wistfully
i
wish
i
had
a
father
uncle
edward
you
see
nurse
does
for
a
mother
but
fathers
are
so
fond
of
their
children
are
they
it
does
not
always
follow
that
they
are
sir
edward
replied
the
probable
son
father
loved
him
and
maxwell
loves
tommy
and
then
there
was
david
you
know
who
really
had
a
wicked
son
with
long
hair
i
forget
his
name
and
he
cried
dreadful
when
he
was
dead
i
sometimes
tell
god
about
it
when
i
in
bed
and
then
he
he
just
seems
to
put
his
arms
round
me
and
send
me
off
to
sleep
at
least
i
think
he
does
nurse
says
god
likes
me
to
call
him
my
father
but
of
course
that
is
quite
the
same
as
having
a
father
i
can
see
maxwell
is
a
very
nice
father
i
think
i
told
him
i
would
pray
for
tommy
every
night
when
i
go
to
bed
and
then
i
told
him
that
god
had
lots
of
probable
sons
too
the
clergyman
said
so
on
sunday
did
he
people
who
have
run
away
from
him
i
been
asking
god
to
make
them
come
back
i
hope
he
will
let
me
know
when
they
do
do
you
know
any
one
who
has
run
away
from
god
uncle
you
are
chattering
too
much
child
said
sir
edward
irritably
sit
still
and
be
quiet
milly
instantly
obeyed
and
after
some
moments
of
silence
her
uncle
said
i
do
mind
your
going
to
maxwell
cottage
but
you
must
never
take
fritz
with
you
he
is
not
allowed
in
that
wood
at
all
do
you
quite
understand
yes
but
i
very
sorry
for
fritz
does
like
being
left
behind
the
tears
were
in
his
eyes
when
nurse
told
him
he
was
to
go
with
me
you
see
no
one
talks
to
him
like
i
do
he
likes
me
to
tell
him
stories
and
i
told
him
when
i
came
back
about
my
visit
so
he
wants
to
go
but
i
wo
take
him
with
me
if
you
say
no
when
she
was
leaving
him
that
night
for
bed
she
paused
a
moment
as
she
wished
him
uncle
edward
when
you
say
your
prayers
will
you
ask
god
to
make
tommy
come
back
home
his
mother
does
want
him
so
badly
i
will
leave
you
to
do
that
was
the
curt
reply
well
if
you
do
want
to
pray
for
tommy
pray
for
god
probable
sons
wo
you
do
uncle
edward
maxwell
said
the
only
thing
that
comforted
her
is
asking
god
to
bring
tommy
back
sir
edward
made
no
reply
only
dismissed
her
more
peremptorily
than
usual
and
when
she
had
left
the
room
he
leaned
his
arms
on
the
chimney
piece
and
resting
his
head
on
them
gazed
silently
into
the
fire
with
a
knitted
brow
his
thoughts
did
not
soothe
him
for
he
presently
raised
his
head
with
a
short
laugh
saying
to
himself
where
is
my
i
will
go
and
have
a
smoke
to
get
rid
of
this
fit
of
the
blues
i
shall
have
to
curb
that
child
tongue
a
little
she
is
getting
too
troublesome
and
while
he
was
pacing
moodily
up
and
down
the
terrace
outside
a
little
figure
with
bent
head
and
closed
eyes
was
saying
softly
and
reverently
as
she
knelt
at
her
nurse
knee
and
o
god
bring
tommy
back
and
do
let
him
be
a
probable
son
any
more
bring
him
home
very
soon
please
and
will
you
bring
back
all
your
probable
sons
who
are
running
away
from
you
for
jesus
christ
sake
amen
sir
edward
did
not
escape
several
visits
from
ladies
in
the
neighborhood
offering
to
befriend
his
little
niece
but
all
these
overtures
were
courteously
and
firmly
rejected
he
told
them
the
child
was
happy
with
her
nurse
he
did
not
wish
her
to
mix
with
other
children
at
present
and
a
year
or
two
hence
would
be
quite
time
enough
to
think
about
her
education
so
milly
was
left
alone
more
than
one
mother
remarking
with
a
shake
of
the
head
it
a
sad
life
for
a
child
but
sir
edward
is
peculiar
and
when
he
gets
a
notion
into
his
head
he
keeps
to
it
the
child
was
not
unhappy
and
when
the
days
grew
shorter
and
her
rambles
out
of
doors
were
curtailed
she
would
lie
on
the
by
the
hall
fire
with
fritz
for
the
hour
together
pouring
out
to
him
all
her
childish
confidences
sometimes
her
uncle
would
find
her
perched
on
the
broad
up
the
staircase
with
her
little
face
pressed
against
the
windowpanes
and
late
on
one
very
cold
afternoon
in
november
he
remonstrated
with
her
it
is
too
cold
for
you
here
millicent
he
said
sternly
you
ought
to
be
in
the
nursery
i
do
feel
cold
she
replied
i
do
like
being
in
the
nursery
all
day
and
when
it
gets
dark
nurse
will
have
the
lamp
lit
and
the
curtains
drawn
and
then
there
are
only
the
walls
and
ceiling
and
the
pictures
to
look
at
i
tired
of
them
i
see
them
every
day
and
what
do
you
see
here
asked
sir
edward
you
come
and
sit
down
and
i
will
tell
you
there
room
uncle
make
fritz
move
a
little
now
you
look
out
with
me
i
can
see
such
a
lot
from
this
window
i
like
looking
out
right
into
the
world
do
you
are
we
not
in
the
world
i
thought
we
were
i
we
are
but
i
mean
god
world
the
insides
of
houses
his
world
are
they
do
you
see
my
trees
i
can
see
goliath
from
this
window
he
looks
very
fierce
he
has
lost
all
his
leaves
and
i
can
almost
hear
him
muttering
to
himself
and
then
uncle
do
you
see
those
nice
thin
trees
cuddling
each
other
i
call
those
david
and
they
just
kissing
each
other
like
they
did
in
the
wood
you
know
do
you
remember
and
there
my
over
there
where
i
sit
when
i
the
probable
son
it
too
dark
for
you
to
see
all
the
others
i
have
names
for
them
all
nearly
but
i
like
to
come
and
watch
them
and
then
i
see
the
stars
just
beginning
to
come
out
do
you
know
what
i
think
about
the
stars
they
angels
eyes
and
they
look
down
and
blink
at
me
so
kindly
and
then
i
look
up
and
blink
back
we
go
on
blinking
at
each
other
sometimes
till
i
get
quite
sleepy
i
watch
the
birds
going
to
bed
too
there
is
so
much
i
can
see
from
this
window
well
run
along
to
the
nursery
now
you
have
been
here
long
enough
milly
jumped
down
from
her
seat
obediently
then
catching
hold
of
her
uncle
hand
as
he
was
moving
away
she
said
just
one
thing
more
i
want
to
show
you
uncle
i
can
see
the
for
such
a
long
way
over
there
and
when
it
is
not
quite
so
dark
i
sit
and
watch
for
tommy
that
maxwell
probable
son
you
know
i
should
be
so
glad
if
i
were
to
see
him
coming
along
one
day
with
his
head
hanging
down
and
all
ragged
and
torn
he
is
sure
to
come
some
day
god
will
bring
him
and
if
i
see
him
coming
first
i
shall
run
off
quick
to
maxwell
and
tell
him
and
then
he
will
run
out
to
meet
him
wo
it
be
lovely
and
with
shining
eyes
milly
shook
back
her
brown
curls
and
looked
up
into
her
uncle
face
for
sympathy
he
patted
her
head
the
nearest
approach
to
a
caress
that
he
ever
gave
her
and
left
her
without
saying
a
word
another
day
later
still
he
came
upon
her
at
the
staircase
window
he
was
dining
out
that
night
and
was
just
leaving
the
house
but
stopped
as
he
noticed
his
little
niece
earnestly
waving
her
handkerchief
up
at
the
window
what
are
you
doing
now
he
inquired
as
he
passed
down
the
stairs
milly
turned
round
her
little
face
flushed
and
eyes
looking
very
sweet
and
serious
i
was
just
waving
to
god
uncle
edward
i
thought
i
saw
him
looking
down
at
me
from
the
sky
sir
edward
passed
on
muttering
inaudibly
i
believe
that
child
lives
in
the
presence
of
god
from
morning
to
night
chapter
a
prodigal
uncle
edward
nurse
and
i
are
going
shopping

you
like
us
to
buy
you
anything
we
are
going
in
the
with
harris
milly
was
dancing
up
and
down
on
the
rug
inside
the
front
door
as
she
spoke
it
was
a
bright
frosty
morning
and
sir
edward
was
leaving
the
with
the
newspaper
and
a
large
packet
of
letters
in
his
hand
he
stopped
and
glanced
at
the
little
figure
as
she
stood
there
eager
anticipation
written
on
her
face
and
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
time
when
he
as
a
boy
looked
upon
a
day
visit
to
the
neighboring
town
nine
miles
away
as
one
of
his
greatest
pleasures
yes
he
said
slowly
fumbling
in
his
waistcoat
pocket

get
me
some
pens
and
blotting
paper
at
the
stationer

will
write
down
the

the
money
keep
the
change
and
buy
anything
you
like
with
it
milly
cheeks
flushed
with
delight
as
she
took
the
money
what
a
lot
it
will
buy
she
said
thank
you
very
much
indeed
i
was
wanting
to
buy
something
my
own
self
and
i
only
a
little
cook
gave
me
but
now
i
shall
be
quite
rich
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
nurse
and
her
little
charge
drove
back
and
sir
edward
met
them
coming
up
the
avenue
milly
face
was
clouded
and
there
were
traces
of
tears
on
her
cheeks
and
this
was
such
an
unusual
sight
that
sir
edward
inquired
of
the
nurse
what
was
the
matter
she
has
not
been
good
sir
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
is
often
that
i
have
to
pull
her
up
but
she
has
given
me
such
a
fright
and
trouble
this
afternoon
as
i
am
not
likely
to
forget
in
a
hurry
what
has
she
been
doing
but
never
mind
i
will
not
detain
you
now
i
can
hear
about
it
when
we
get
in
nurse
was
evidently
very
disturbed
in
mind
for
she
poured
into
sir
edward
ear
directly
they
were
inside
the
hall
a
confused
story
i
was
in
the
grocer
sir
and
i
knew
i
should
be
there
some
time
for
cook
she
gave
me
so
many
commissions
i
had
to
write
a
long
list
of
them
i
said
to
miss
milly
can
stand
outside
but
do
go
a
step
farther
she
knows
she
is
never
allowed
to
speak
to
such
people
known
as
i
told
her
children
being
carried
bodily
off
and
set
down
at
a
street
corner
with
hardly
a
rag
on
their
backs
and
to
think
of
her
marching
off
with
him
and
never
a
thought
of
my
anxiety
and
the
way
i
went
rushing
up
and
down
the
streets
and
the
policemen
they
are
perfectly
useless
to
help
a
person
but
can
only
stare
at
you
and
grin
i
sure
i
never
expected
to
light
eyes
on
her
again
and
i
lost
my
purse
and
my
best
umbrella
i
left
them
both
somewhere
but
it
was
nigh
on
two
hours
i
spent
and
my
shopping
not
near
done
and
he
the
greatest
looking
rascal
that
one
might
see
coming
out
of
jail
i
sure
i
should
have
been
so
angry
but
to
see
her
smiling
face
as
if
she
had
done
any
wrong
at
all
nor
disobeyed
me
flatly
and
most
likely
put
herself
in
the
way
of
catching
the
most
infectious
disease
from
the
very
look
of
him
and
run
the
risk
of
being
robbed
and
perhaps
murdered
and
not
an
idea
in
her
head
that
she
was
a
very
naughty
child
but
quite
expected
me
to
see
the
reasonableness
of
it
all
nurse
stopped
for
breath
whilst
milly
hanging
head
heaving
chest
and
quick
sobs
showed
that
by
this
time
nurse
words
had
quite
convinced
her
of
her
sir
edward
was
surprised
at
the
interest
he
felt
in
his
little
trouble
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
understand
your
story
nurse
he
said
quietly
but
i
daresay
miss
millicent
will
tell
me
herself
come
into
the
study
child
with
me
he
took
her
hand
in
his
and
led
her
away
while
nurse
looked
after
him
in
astonishment
and
ford
the
old
butler
standing
by
said
with
great
solemnity
you
may
well
stare
nurse
mark
my
words
that
child
will
be
able
to
twist
him
round
with
her
little
finger
one
of
these
days
i
see
it
it
will
be
a
terrible
to
the
master
but
there
i
will
say
that
the
women
always
conquer
and
they
begin
it
when
in
short
frocks
i
do
see
the
remarkableness
in
a
gentleman
taking
notice
of
his
own
sister
child
returned
nurse
testily
the
wonder
is
that
he
should
hold
her
at
arm
length
as
he
does
and
treat
her
as
if
she
were
a
dog
or
a
piece
of
furniture
without
any
feelings
and
she
his
own
flesh
and
blood
too
there
no
down
to
have
a
spark
of
humanity
in
his
breast
occasionally
and
nurse
sailed
upstairs
the
loss
of
her
purse
and
umbrella
having
considerably
ruffled
her
usually
even
temper
sir
edward
seated
himself
by
the
study
fire
and
milly
stood
before
him
one
little
hand
resting
upon
his
knee
and
the
other
holding
her
tiny
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
vainly
trying
to
restrain
her
sobs
now
suppose
you
stop
crying
and
tell
me
what
has
happened
her
uncle
said
feeling
moved
at
seeing
his
usually
little
niece
in
such
grief
milly
applied
her
handkerchief
vigorously
to
her
eyes
and
looking
up
with
quivering
lips
she
said
i
did
mean
to
be
naughty
uncle
nurse
has
been
angry
with
me
like
she
is
now
for
and
i
unhappy
the
pitiful
tone
and
look
touched
sir
edward
heart
and
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
he
did
what
he
had
never
as
yet
attempted
lifted
her
upon
his
knee
and
told
her
to
proceed
with
her
story
and
milly
after
a
final
struggle
with
her
tears
got
the
better
of
them
and
was
able
to
give
him
a
pretty
clear
account
of
what
had
happened
i
had
bought
your
pens
and
uncle
and
was
going
to
a
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
money
when
nurse
had
finished
at
the
grocer
i
was
standing
outside
when
i
saw
a
man
coming
along
he
limped
and
his
hat
was
broken
in
and
he
was
so
ragged
that
i
thought
he
must
be
a
probable
son
and
then
i
thought
he
might
be
tommy
going
home
and
when
i
thought
that
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
i
forgot
all
about
nurse
and
i
forgot
she
told
me
to
stay
there
and
i
ran
after
him
as
hard
as
i
could
i
caught
him
up
and
he
looked
very
astonished
when
i
asked
him
was
his
name
tommy
he
said
and
he
laughed
at
me
and
then
i
asked
him
was
he
a
probable
son
because
he
looked
like
one
he
said
he
did
know
what
kind
of
person
that
was
and
then
i
had
to
explain
it
to
him
he
told
me
he
had
never
had
a
home
to
run
away
from
so
that
would
do
but
he
really
looked
just
like
the
man
i
seen
in
maxwell
picture
and
i
told
him
so
and
then
i
found
out
what
he
was
and
i
was
so
sorry
and
yet
i
was
so
glad
milly
paused
and
her
large
expressive
eyes
shone
as
she
turned
them
up
to
her
uncle
face
and
her
voice
dropped
almost
to
a
whisper
as
she
said
i
found
out
he
was
one
of
god
probable
sons
when
i
asked
him
if
he
had
run
away
from
god
he
said
yes
he
supposed
he
had
done
that
so
of
course
he
was
ragged
and
unhappy
that
is
not
always
the
case
put
in
sir
edward
half
touched
half
amused
sometimes
it
is
very
rich
people
who
run
away
from
god
and
they
get
richer
when
they
are
away
from
him
milly
looked
puzzled
but
they
ca
be
happy
uncle
oh
they
never
can
be
perhaps
not
well
i
talked
to
this
poor
man
till
we
had
walked
quite
away
from
the
shops
and
then
he
turned
down
a
lane
and
i
went
with
him
and
we
were
both
rather
tired
so
we
sat
down
together
on
some
doorsteps
inside
an
archway
and
he
told
me
all
about
himself
his
name
is
jack
and
his
father
and
mother
are
dead
like
mine
and
he
got
drunk
one
night
and
fell
down
and
broke
his
arm
and
then
he
went
to
a
hospital
and
when
he
got
well
and
went
back
to
his
work
again
his
master
could
take
him
because
some
one
else
was
in
his
place
and
he
could
get
any
work
i
asked
him
were
there
no
pigs
to
keep
but
he
said
there
were
any
in
london
and
he
was
there
and
for
six
months
he
told
me
he
had
been
the
tramp
that
what
he
called
it
i
asked
him
what
that
meant
and
he
said
just
walking
on
every
day
to
no
place
particular
and
he
said
something
about
going
to
the
bad
which
i
could
quite
understand
then
i
asked
him
why
he
did
go
back
to
god
and
he
said
he
had
been
a
good
boy
once
when
he
went
to
and
he
had
a
very
good
uncle
who
kept
a
baker
shop
in
london
and
who
wanted
him
to
go
and
live
with
him
but
he
would
because
he
was
too
good
for
him
and
i
asked
him
why
he
would
go
to
him
now
and
he
said
he
tramp
back
again
to
london
it
was
too
far
and
he
had
no
money
so
then
i
opened
my
purse
and
we
counted
over
my
money
together
and
he
said
it
was
just
enough
to
take
him
back
if
i
would
lend
it
to
him
so
of
course
i
did
and
he
asked
me
my
name
and
where
i
lived
and
i
told
him
the
scoundrel
muttered
sir
edward
milly
paused
why
are
you
looking
so
angry
uncle
i
was
so
glad
to
give
him
the
money
and
then
we
talked
a
good
deal
and
i
begged
him
not
to
be
one
of
god
probable
sons
any
more
fancy
he
would
believe
god
loved
him
and
he
would
believe
that
god
wanted
him
back
i
told
him
i
should
be
quite
frightened
to
get
away
from
god
and
he
well
he
almost
did
seem
to
care
he
said
no
one
cared
what
came
of
him
whether
he
was
hung
dead
or
not
and
i
told
him
no
one
cared
for
me
much
except
nurse
but
god
did
i
feel
he
loves
me
and
i
know
he
loves
jack
just
the
same
does
he
uncle
and
when
did
nurse
find
you
inquired
sir
edward
evading
this
question
milly
little
face
which
had
been
gradually
brightening
with
the
interest
of
her
story
now
clouded
over
again
and
she
hung
her
head
she
was
fearful
angry
with
me
she
was
quite
hot
and
red
and
she
snatched
me
away
and
said
that
jack
was
a
thief
and
and
a
vagbag
or
something
like
that
she
scolded
me
all
the
way
home
and
i
do
think
she
will
ever
love
me
again
she
said
it
was
just
a
chance
she
found
me
and
if
she
had
come
along
that
lane
i
should
have
been
lost
forever
and
she
was
angry
most
of
all
because
i
shook
hands
with
jack
and
wished
him
i
do
think
nurse
would
run
and
meet
a
probable
son
if
she
had
one
she
thinks
all
ragged
people
are
wicked
but
i
dreadful
sorry
i
was
disobedient
do
you
think
i
have
been
very
naughty
uncle
edward
sir
edward
twisted
the
ends
of
his
moustache
slowly
i
think
you
were
naughty
to
run
after
a
strange
man
like
that
and
i
quite
understand
nurse
displeasure
you
made
her
exceedingly
anxious
and
is
god
very
angry
with
me
god
is
not
pleased
with
disobedient
children
may
i
kneel
down
and
ask
him
to
forgive
me
now
sir
edward
hesitated
i
think
you
had
better
go
to
the
nursery
and
do
it
there
i
do
want
to
see
nurse
till
i
have
done
it
may
i
will
you
ask
god
to
forgive
me
too
your
prayer
will
be
quite
sufficient
milly
slipped
off
his
knee
and
then
kneeling
down
with
folded
hands
and
closed
eyes
she
said
softly
please
god
will
you
forgive
me
i
so
sorry
i
disobeyed
nurse
and
ran
away
and
please
take
care
of
jack
and
bring
him
back
to
you
for
jesus
christ
sake
amen
now
run
along
to
nurse
and
do
cry
any
more
said
sir
edward
as
he
rose
from
his
seat
milly
looked
back
wistfully
as
she
reached
the
door
do
you
think
nurse
is
still
angry
tell
nurse
from
me
that
she
is
not
to
scold
you
any
more
the
loss
of
your
money
ought
to
be
a
lesson
to
you
but
i
did
lose
it
uncle
i
lent
it
to
jack
he
would
let
me
give
it
to
him
he
said
he
would
send
it
back
to
me
in
a
letter
sir
edward
laughed
unbelievingly
and
milly
trotted
upstairs
to
be
received
with
open
arms
by
nurse
at
the
nursery
door
there
never
mind
my
dear
i
have
been
very
angry
with
you
but
you
never
do
such
a
thing
again
come
and
have
your
tea
i
had
a
cup
already
and
feel
wonderful
better
now
do
cry
any
more
bless
your
little
heart
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
in
tears
with
that
nurse
took
her
up
in
her
arms
and
poor
tired
little
milly
whispered
as
she
clung
to
her
i
was
afraid
you
would
never
love
me
again
i
told
god
i
sorry
do
you
quite
forgive
me
quite
my
lamb
was
the
reply
and
as
to
loving
you
i
should
give
over
doing
that
if
you
were
twice
as
troublesome
chapter
vi
a
promise
kept
about
a
fortnight
later
sir
edward
who
always
opened
the
himself
found
there
a
letter
addressed
to
his
little
niece
and
sent
a
message
to
the
nursery
to
tell
her
to
come
down
to
him
she
arrived
very
surprised
at
the
summons
as
sir
edward
always
wished
to
be
left
undisturbed
at
his
breakfast
but
when
she
saw
the
letters
on
the
table
she
cried
out
joyously
good
morning
uncle
edward
i
know
there
a
letter
from
jack
for
me
is
there
i
been
waiting
for
it
every
day
i
think
there
may
be
judging
from
the
writing
on
the
envelope
come
here
and
open
it
milly
took
the
letter
and
her
little
fingers
fairly
trembled
with
excitement
as
she
opened
it
saying
softly
to
herself
as
she
did
so
i
knew
he
would
keep
his
promise
i
knew
he
was
a
thief
a
money
order
dropped
out
well
said
sir
edward
you
were
right
little
woman
and
we
were
wrong
would
you
like
me
to
read
it
for
you
yes
please
uncle
the
letter
read
as
follows
i
am
as
good
as
my
word
little
miss
in
sending
you
back
what
you
lent
me
with
many
grateful
thanks
for
the
loan
as
i
reached
london
safe
and
have
never
touched
a
drop
of
drink
since
i
seen
you
and
am
in
work
at
my
uncle
which
is
good
of
him
to
take
me
and
am
getting
good
wages
and
goes
to
church
again
and
my
uncle
has
a
chum
which
is
a
street
preacher
and
comes
along
of
plenty
of
fellows
like
i
was
and
i
told
him
of
your
young
fellow
tommy
maxwell
and
he
will
keep
a
for
him
tell
the
woman
that
fetched
you
sharp
away
that
i
hold
up
my
head
with
her
yet
and
every
night
i
asks
god
to
bless
you
for
i
hopes
i
am
getting
on
the
right
track
again
and
thank
you
kindly
for
your
talk
which
is
sticking
to
me
yours
obediently
jack
gray
sir
edward
laid
the
letter
down
in
silence
when
he
had
finished
reading
it
milly
face
was
radiant
i
never
had
a
letter
in
my
life
before
uncle
but
i
do
quite
understand
all
of
it
will
you
explain
it
to
me
and
this
her
uncle
did
sending
her
upstairs
at
length
to
show
it
to
nurse
but
sitting
wrapped
in
thought
himself
and
leaving
both
his
letters
and
breakfast
untouched
for
some
considerable
time
that
same
day
he
went
out
driving
in
the
afternoon
with
a
young
horse
and
returning
home
met
a
traction
engine
at
which
the
horse
instantly
took
fright
and
bolted
for
some
time
sir
edward
kept
steadily
to
his
seat
and
though
powerless
to
check
the
animal
course
was
able
to
guide
it
but
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
the
trap
was
at
last
upset
and
he
was
thrown
violently
to
the
ground
he
had
no
groom
with
him
and
the
accident
took
place
on
a
lonely
road
so
that
it
was
not
till
an
hour
later
that
help
came
in
the
shape
of
a
farmer
returning
from
market
in
his
cart
he
found
sir
edward
unconscious
and
the
horse
still
feebly
struggling
to
extricate
himself
from
under
the
trap
which
was
badly
broken
it
was
about
seven
in
the
evening
when
sir
edward
was
brought
home
and
he
had
three
ribs
broken
besides
some
very
severe
injuries
to
his
head
the
doctor
wished
to
telegraph
for
a
nurse
from
london
but
sir
edward
had
a
horror
of
them
and
having
recovered
consciousness
shook
his
head
vehemently
when
it
was
suggested
and
so
it
ended
in
milly
nurse
volunteering
to
assist
his
valet
in
nursing
him
poor
little
milly
wandered
about
the
house
with
fritz
at
her
heels
in
a
very
fashion
what
with
the
anxiety
in
her
heart
lest
her
uncle
should
die
and
the
absence
of
her
nurse
who
could
spare
little
time
now
to
look
after
her
she
felt
most
forlorn
and
her
greatest
comfort
was
to
go
down
to
the
keeper
cottage
and
talk
to
maxwell
sir
edward
was
soon
out
of
danger
but
he
was
a
long
time
recovering
and
required
most
careful
nursing
milly
begged
and
entreated
to
go
in
and
see
him
but
this
was
not
allowed
at
last
permission
was
given
by
the
doctor
for
a
very
short
visit
and
the
child
stole
in
on
but
insisted
upon
taking
a
large
brown
paper
parcel
in
with
her
the
contents
of
which
were
unknown
to
all
except
herself
softly
she
crept
up
to
the
bed
and
looked
at
her
uncle
bandaged
head
and
worn
face
with
the
greatest
awe
he
put
out
his
hand
which
she
took
in
hers
and
then
she
said
her
brown
eyes
fixed
wistfully
on
his
face
i
wanted
to
see
you
uncle
edward
for
so
long
i
wish
you
would
let
me
come
in
and
help
to
nurse
you
sir
edward
smiled
then
shook
his
head
i
been
asking
god
to
make
you
better
so
many
times
she
continued
softly
stroking
his
hand
as
she
spoke
and
he
is
going
to
make
you
live
again
now
is
he
i
was
quite
sure
whether
you
might
like
to
die
best
but
i
did
want
you
to
nurse
says
i
must
stay
a
moment
but
i
brought
you
a
present
maxwell
went
to
the
town
and
got
it
for
me
with
the
money
jack
sent
back
to
me
may
i
open
it
for
you
reading
assent
in
his
eyes
milly
eagerly
removed
her
brown
paper
and
then
lifted
on
to
the
bed
with
difficulty
a
picture
of
the
prodigal
son
in
a
plain
oak
frame
is
it
a
lovely
one
uncle
edward
there
the
prodigal
son
learned
to
say
it
properly
now
all
in
rags
hurrying
along
the
road
and
there
his
old
father
in
the
distance
coming
to
meet
him
and
can
you
see
the
words
underneath
will
arise
and
go
to
my
father
and
will
say
unto
him
father
i
have
sinned
against
heaven
and
before
i
thought
you
would
like
it
to
look
at
while
you
are
in
bed
may
i
rest
it
against
the
rail
at
the
bottom
of
your
bed
then
you
can
see
it
beautifully
nurse
came
forward
and
helped
the
child
to
put
the
picture
in
the
place
she
wished
and
sir
edward
tried
to
look
pleased
and
said
in
a
low
tone
thank
you
little
one
i
can
see
it
well
from
there
but
under
his
breath
he
muttered
has
she
a
purpose
in
bringing
that
everlasting
subject
before
me
i
sick
to
death
of
it
i
shall
get
rid
of
that
picture
when
she
is
gone
but
he
did
not
his
eyes
grew
somewhat
wistful
as
he
gazed
upon
it
and
later
in
the
day
when
nurse
asked
him
if
he
would
like
to
have
it
removed
he
shook
his
head
in
the
negative
no
one
could
know
his
thoughts
during
those
long
days
and
nights
of
weariness
and
pain
the
restlessness
of
body
did
not
equal
the
restlessness
of
soul
and
the
past
came
back
with
a
startling
vividness
the
wasted
years
the
misused
talents
and
above
all
the
heart
against
its
rightful
owner
now
seemed
to
stand
up
in
judgment
against
him
often
in
his
wretchedness
would
he
groan
aloud
and
wish
for
unconsciousness
to
come
to
his
aid
and
consign
to
oblivion
his
accusing
memory
it
was
a
cold
gray
afternoon
maxwell
little
kitchen
was
in
perfect
order
the
fire
shed
flickering
lights
on
the
bright
on
the
wall
and
the
blue
and
white
china
on
the
dresser
was
touched
with
a
ruddy
glow
maxwell
herself
seated
in
a
wooden
in
spotless
white
apron
was
knitting
busily
as
she
talked
and
milly
on
a
low
stool
the
tabby
in
her
arms
with
her
curls
in
pretty
disorder
and
her
large
dark
eyes
gazing
earnestly
into
the
fire
completed
the
picture
do
you
like
winter
mrs
maxwell
she
was
asking
well
my
dear
i
ca
say
as
i
do
prefer
the
summer
but
there
the
almighty
sends
it
and
it
must
be
right
and
i
do
think
folks
have
a
right
to
grumble
and
go
rushing
off
to
them
foreign
parts
their
own
country
and
the
weather
god
gives
them
because
they
say
they
must
have
sunshine
i
allays
thinks
they
no
sunshine
in
their
hearts
or
they
would
be
so
up
and
down
with
the
weather
i
think
winter
is
a
very
lonely
time
maxwell
and
i
so
sorry
for
the
trees
i
was
out
this
morning
with
fritz
and
i
talked
to
them
and
tried
to
cheer
them
up
and
i
think
they
feel
they
nearly
dead
poor
things
and
they
were
shivering
with
cold
this
morning
they
were
really
i
told
them
they
would
be
happy
when
next
summer
comes
but
they
sighed
and
shook
their
heads
it
such
a
long
time
to
wait
and
they
have
nothing
to
do
they
can
only
stand
still
i
was
very
sad
this
morning
after
i
had
talked
to
them
i
went
down
to
the
plantation
at
the
bottom
of
the
lawn
and
on
the
way
i
came
to
a
poor
dead
frog
fritz
sniffed
at
him
but
he
did
seem
to
be
sorry
i
do
know
how
he
died
i
thought
perhaps
he
had
stayed
out
in
the
cold
and
got
frozen
he
felt
so
very
cold
i
took
him
up
and
buried
him
and
i
wondered
if
his
mother
would
miss
him
and
then
i
went
on
a
little
farther
and
there
were
some
little
bird
feathers
all
in
a
heap
on
the
ground
i
felt
sure
a
cruel
cat
had
been
eating
it
up
and
i
could
help
crying
for
everything
seemed
to
be
dying
and
when
i
got
to
the
plantation
i
was
a
little
comforted
for
the
looked
so
comfortable
and
warm
they
had
lost
their
leaves
like
the
other
trees
but
do
you
know
in
the
middle
of
them
all
was
a
tall
thin
bare
tree
he
looked
so
lonely
and
unhappy
and
he
was
the
only
one
without
any
leaves
one
of
those
birches
i
expect
my
man
he
said
the
other
day
that
the
fir
plantation
yonder
wanted
weeding
out
well
i
could
bear
to
see
him
so
sad
so
i
crept
right
in
amongst
the
firs
until
i
got
to
him
and
then
i
put
my
arms
right
round
him
and
cuddled
him
tight
i
told
him
god
would
take
care
of
him
and
give
him
a
beautiful
new
green
dress
next
summer
but
he
seemed
to
feel
the
cold
and
i
expect
the
other
trees
are
very
kind
to
him
i
always
think
the
firs
are
very
stiff
and
proud
i
i
kissed
him
before
i
came
away
it
was
a
sad
morning
milly
tone
was
truly
pathetic
and
maxwell
who
loved
to
hear
her
childish
fancies
and
never
laughed
at
them
now
looked
up
from
her
knitting
sympathetically
you
sad
yourself
dear
is
your
uncle
pretty
well
i
think
he
is
getting
better
but
he
must
talk
and
nurse
wo
let
me
see
him
i
think
it
winter
makes
me
sad
mrs
maxwell
there
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
milly
stroked
her
cat
thoughtfully
then
she
said
if
uncle
edward
had
died
what
would
have
happened
to
me
should
i
have
had
to
go
to
the
workhouse
bless
your
little
heart
no
why
my
man
and
i
was
saying
the
other
day
that
it
most
sure
as
you
be
mistress
of
the
property
one
day
sir
edward
he
have
no
other
kith
or
kin
as
far
as
we
know
workhouse
indeed
a
place
where
they
takes
in
tramps
and
vagabonds
i
heard
some
of
the
maids
talking
about
it
pursued
milly
they
said
they
wondered
what
would
happen
to
me
i
think
he
is
my
only
uncle
so
i
could
go
anywhere
else
i
wish
i
had
a
father
maxwell
always
wishing
for
one
i
never
remember
my
father
my
mother
i
do
but
she
was
always
ill
and
she
did
like
me
to
bother
her
do
you
know
i
thought
when
i
came
to
uncle
edward
that
he
would
be
a
kind
of
father
miss
kent
said
he
would
but
i
afraid
he
does
like
me
to
bother
him
either
i
should
like
him
to
take
me
up
in
his
arms
and
kiss
me
do
you
think
he
ever
will
i
feel
as
if
no
one
cares
for
me
sometimes
i
think
a
certain
little
apple
dumpling
as
i
put
in
the
oven
for
some
one
is
smelling
as
if
it
wants
to
come
out
was
maxwell
brisk
response
as
she
bustled
out
of
her
chair
her
old
eyes
moist
with
feeling
in
an
instant
milly
pensiveness
had
disappeared
a
baked
apple
dumpling
had
great
charms
for
her
and
no
one
would
have
believed
that
the
child
with
the
merry
laugh
now
dancing
around
the
room
and
climbing
up
to
the
dresser
for
a
plate
was
the
same
as
the
one
who
had
so
sadly
discoursed
a
few
moments
before
on
the
mournfulness
of
winter
and
of
her
orphaned
state
did
you
make
such
nice
apple
dumplings
for
tommy
she
asked
presently
busy
with
her
fork
and
spoon
and
looking
supremely
content
with
herself
and
surroundings
ah
did
i
i
mind
when
he
used
to
come
in
on
saturdays
from
the
forge
i
always
had
a
hot
pudding
for
him
he
used
to
say
there
was
no
one
as
cooked
as
well
as
mother
he
a
long
time
coming
home
is
he
maxwell
i
get
so
tired
of
waiting
i
wish
he
would
come
for
christmas
i
not
tired
of
waiting
maxwell
said
softly
and
i
waited
these
nine
years
but
it
sometimes
seems
as
if
it
is
only
yesterday
as
he
went
off
i
feel
at
times
like
fretting
sadly
over
him
and
wish
i
knew
if
he
was
alive
or
dead
but
then
the
lord
do
comfort
one
and
i
know
he
sees
just
where
he
is
and
he
let
me
know
when
the
right
time
comes
i
expecting
him
every
day
said
milly
with
a
cheerful
little
nod
i
was
telling
god
about
him
last
night
at
my
window
on
the
stairs
and
it
seemed
as
if
god
said
to
me
that
he
was
coming
very
soon
now
i
should
wonder
if
he
came
next
week
the
keeper
entered
the
cottage
at
this
moment
and
milly
jumped
off
her
seat
at
once
i
afraid
it
time
for
me
to
be
going
back
nurse
said
i
was
to
be
in
at
four
are
you
going
to
take
me
maxwell
do
i
always
see
you
safe
and
sound
up
at
the
house
maxwell
said
and
do
you
know
it
has
struck
four
ten
minutes
ago
when
you
and
my
old
woman
get
together
to
have
a
crack
as
the
saying
is
you
do
know
how
time
passes
we
shall
have
to
run
for
it
milly
was
being
rapidly
covered
up
in
a
thick
plaid
by
maxwell
there
now
my
dearie
till
next
i
see
you
and
do
be
doleful
in
that
big
house
by
yourself
your
uncle
will
soon
be
well
and
nurse
will
be
better
able
to
see
after
you
i
do
know
what
all
those
servants
are
after
that
they
ca
amuse
you
a
bit
nurse
does
like
me
ever
to
go
near
the
servants
hall
said
milly
i
promised
her
i
would
sarah
stays
in
the
nursery
with
me
but
she
runs
away
downstairs
pretty
often
mrs
maxwell
it
was
getting
dark
maxwell
soon
had
the
child
in
his
strong
arms
and
was
striding
along
at
a
great
pace
when
passing
a
rather
dark
corner
a
man
suddenly
sprang
out
of
the
bushes
and
took
to
his
heels
maxwell
shouted
out
wrathfully
let
me
see
you
in
here
again
and
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
you
scoundrel
oh
maxwell
cried
milly
who
is
it
one
of
them
skulking
poachers
they
always
in
here
after
the
rabbits
if
i
had
you
to
look
after
and
had
my
thick
stick
i
would
after
him
but
you
would
have
hurt
him
i
should
have
taught
him
a
lesson
that
i
should
but
maxwell
you
must
really
only
think
he
might
be
tommy
coming
home
you
could
see
who
it
was
could
you
it
would
be
dreadful
if
you
chased
away
tommy
no
fear
o
that
maxwell
said
in
a
quieter
tone
my
own
son
skulk
along
like
that
he
was
a
ragged
vagabond
that
what
he
was
prodigal
sons
are
nearly
always
ragged
he
might
have
been
some
prodigal
son
maxwell
he
was
just
a
poacher
my
dear
and
i
think
i
know
the
chap
staying
at
the
blue
dragon
and
has
been
this
place
for
some
time
perhaps
he
is
one
of
god
prodigal
sons
said
milly
softly
like
jack
was
to
this
maxwell
made
no
reply
but
when
he
set
her
down
in
the
hall
a
little
later
he
said
do
you
fret
about
our
tommy
i
should
know
him
fast
enough
he
would
run
from
his
own
father
and
milly
went
in
and
that
night
added
another
petition
to
her
prayers
and
please
god
if
the
man
who
ran
away
from
maxwell
is
a
prodigal
son
bring
him
back
to
his
father
for
jesus
sake
amen
chapter
vii
nurse
where
is
miss
millicent

afternoon

little
fresh

left
alone
now
sir
edward
tone
was
impatient
he
was
getting
to
the
convalescent
stage
and
nurse
found
him
a
most
trying
patient
nothing
would
please
him
and
he
wearied
both
himself
and
her
with
his
perpetual
complaints
i
thought
she
would
only
worry
you
sir
she
has
been
asking
me
every
day
to
come
in
and
see
you
i
will
fetch
her
at
once
milly
shortly
appeared
in
a
clean
pinafore
her
little
face
radiant
with
smiles
as
she
climbed
up
into
the
chair
by
the
bedside
and
gently
stroked
the
hand
that
was
given
her
she
said
with
sparkling
eyes
nurse
says
i
may
stay
here
all
alone
with
you
uncle
wo
that
be
lovely

i
give

there
and
talk
to
me
what
shall
i
talk
about
anything
you
like
you
never
seem
to
be
at
a
loss
for
conversation
milly
considered
for
a
moment
i
had
so
few
people
to
talk
to
lately
you
see
i
generally
talk
most
to
fritz
he

he
does
talk

of
christmas

afraid

a
long
time

very
glad
god

made
you
better
nurse
said
it
was
a
mercy
you
had
broken
your
neck
do
you
know
uncle
i
saw
such
a
sad
sight
yesterday
morning
i
was
down
in
the
fir
plantation
with
fritz
and
we
came
upon
a
dear
little
rabbit
caught
in
a
steel
trap
maxwell
said
a
poacher
had
put
it
there
and
he
was
very
angry
the
rabbit
was
quite
dead
and
his
two
hind
legs
were
broken
was
it
dreadful
what
is
a
poacher
uncle
a
thief
a
man
that
steals
game
that
is
his
maxwell
says
there
are
lots
of
poachers
about
i
so
afraid
he
will
think
tommy
is
one
when
he
comes
back
i
do
hope
he
will
be
careful
because
if
it
dark
he
might
make
a
mistake
would
it
be
dreadful
if
he
hurt
his
own
prodigal
son
and
i
expect
tommy
will
look
very
like
a
poacher
he
is
sure
to
have
ragged
dirty
clothes
if
i
was
here
milly
paused
and
gazed
dreamily
in
front
of
her
for
some
minutes
in
silence
well
inquired
sir
edward
looking
at
his
little
niece
with
interest
as
she
sat
in
her
big
chair
her
elbows
supported
by
her
knees
and
her
chin
resting
in
her
hands
are
you
going
into
a
brown
study
i
was
just
thinking
if
i
was
a
prodigal
son
i
mean
a
real
one
not
just
playing
at
it
as
i
do
i
would
rather
be
one
of
god
prodigal
sons
than
belonging
to
any
one
else
why
because
i
would
know
for
certain
he
would
meet
me
and
take
me
back
nurse
told
me
she
had
a
cousin
who
ran
away
and
made
himself
a
soldier
and
when
he
was
sorry
and
wanted
to
come
home
his
father
shut
the
door
in
his
face
and
would
let
him
in
and
then
there
tommy
i
help
that
his
father
might
know
him
but
god
ca
make
mistakes
it
must
be
lovely
just
to
run
right
into
god
arms
and
hear
him
saying
forth
the
best
robe
and
put
it
on
him
i
should
love
to
have
him
say
that
to
me
milly
little
face
glowed
with
pleasure
at
the
thought
and
she
turned
her
expressive
eyes
toward
her
uncle
who
lay
with
knitted
brows
listening
to
her
and
supposing
if
god
would
not
receive
you
supposing
you
had
stayed
away
so
long
and
had
refused
to
listen
to
his
voice
when
he
called
and
then
when
you
did
want
to
come
back
you
felt
it
would
be
too
late
what
would
you
do
then
milly
smiled
why
uncle
it
would
be
never
too
late
for
god
would
it
maxwell
said
he
would
be
glad
to
see
tommy
if
he
came
back
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
god
would
never
turn
one
of
his
prodigal
sons
away
he
loves
them
so
that
he
sent
jesus
to
die
for
them
he
would
never
say
he
could
have
them
back
again
sir
edward
said
no
more
and
after
another
pause
the
child
went
on
i
was
asking
maxwell
the
other
day
if
she
had
some
best
clothes
for
tommy
when
he
came
home
and
she
took
me
upstairs
into
his
little
room
and
opened
a
long
drawer
and
told
me
to
look
inside
and
there
were
his
best
sunday
coat
and
waistcoat
and
trousers
and
a
silk
handkerchief
with
lavender
in
it
and
a
necktie
with
yellow
and
red
stripes
and
she
told
me
they
had
been
there
for
nine
years
and
she
shakes
them
out
and
brushes
them
every
saturday
he
did
run
away
in
his
best
clothes
you
know
he
left
them
behind
so
they
quite
ready
for
him
the
only
thing
maxwell
has
got
is
the
ring
the
what
inquired
sir
edward
amused
the
ring
milly
repeated
earnestly
maxwell
will
have
to
say
a
ring
on
his
hand
and
shoes
on
his
maxwell
has
got
a
pair
of
carpet
slippers
i
could
bear
her
not
having
any
shoes
ready
for
him
so
we
looked
about
and
found
a
pair
that
are
just
too
small
for
maxwell
and
i
put
them
in
the
drawer
my
own
self
maxwell
says
he
wo
want
a
ring
and
that
she
thinks
the
bible
people
dressed
differently
and
she
said
tommy
was
a
poor
man
son
it
was
as
if
he
was
rich
but
i
do
know
i
do
like
to
think
we
have
no
ring
for
him
i
suppose
you
have
one
uncle
that
you
would
like
to
give
him
sir
edward
put
his
head
back
on
his
cushions
and
laughed
aloud
then
noting
milly
troubled
face
he
said
wait
till
tommy
comes
back
little
woman
and
then
it
will
be
time
enough
to
see
about
his
ring
though
i
quite
agree
with
his
mother
that
it
would
be
most
unfitting
you
have
had
the
picture
i
gave
you
taken
away
uncle
said
milly
presently
her
quick
eyes
roving
round
the
room
ah
you
had
it
hung
up
on
the
wall
that
nice
there
you
can
see
it
from
your
bed
you
like
looking
at
it
does
it
make
you
feel
happy
i
ca
say
it
does
replied
sir
edward
glancing
at
the
picture
in
question
why
ought
it
to
make
me
feel
happy
oh
it
so
nice
to
think
he
is
just
getting
home
after
being
away
so
long
i
wonder
if
he
was
a
great
time
walking
back
how
long
do
you
think
it
takes
one
of
god
prodigal
sons
to
get
back
to
him
uncle
i
should
say
a
very
long
time
indeed
said
sir
edward
slowly
but
how
long
two
days
or
six
hours
or
a
week
it
would
depend
perhaps
on
how
long
they
had
been
away
from
him
it
rather
hard
to
understand
said
milly
wrinkling
her
little
brow
perplexedly
because
god
is
everywhere
is
he
and
i
should
have
thought
he
would
have
been
close
by
them
all
the
time
i
was
asking
nurse
about
it
and
she
said
that
god
was
near
them
only
they
have
anything
to
say
to
him
and
did
bad
things
and
shut
the
lord
jesus
out
of
their
heart
and
let
satan
in
and
then
god
had
to
leave
them
till
they
said
they
said
they
were
sorry
i
suppose
directly
they
say
i
have
sinned
against
heaven
and
in
thy
sight
and
am
no
more
worthy
to
be
called
thy
son
then
god
just
folds
them
in
his
arms
and
forgives
them
and
takes
them
back
again
is
that
it
look
here
i
think
we
have
had
enough
of
this
subject
talk
about
something
else
sir
edward
tone
was
irritable
milly
ready
tongue
obeyed
nurse
says
it
so
cold
that
she
thinks
it
will
snow
do
you
think
it
will
it
is
quite
smoky
by
the
river
nurse
says
it
is
a
fog
i
wondered
where
it
all
came
from
do
you
think
it
might
be
god
breath
uncle
as
she
was
chatting
on
suddenly
there
came
a
sharp
knock
at
the
door
and
a
visitor
appeared
thought
i
look
you
up
for
i
heard
you
were
on
the
sick
list
good
gracious
you
have
been
pretty
bad
have
you
will
you
put
me
up
for
a
night
or
two
i
expect
you
want
a
little
cheerful
company
talking
volubly
major
lovell
for
it
was
he
came
forward
and
looked
with
real
concern
on
sir
edward
altered
face
i
very
glad
to
see
you
said
the
latter
heartily
holding
out
his
hand
come
and
stay
for
as
long
as
you
like
i
sick
to
death
of
my
own
society
and
is
this
the
small
party
that
arrived
so
unexpectedly
when
i
was
here
before
inquired
major
lovell
looking
down
at
milly
who
still
sat
in
the
big
chair
regarding
the
with
her
large
brown
eyes
yes
said
sir
edward
a
faint
smile
hovering
about
his
lips
as
he
remembered
his
horror
of
her
advent
she
is
taking
charge
of
me
this
afternoon
milly
held
out
her
little
hand
with
all
the
grace
of
a
duchess
i
remember
you
she
said
you
were
one
of
the
gentlemen
that
laughed
at
me
i
do
think
i
could
have
been
guilty
of
such
rudeness
surely
now
i
think
you
may
run
away
sir
edward
said
and
tell
nurse
i
will
ring
when
i
want
her
milly
obeyed
and
confided
to
nurse
that
she
hoped
the
new
gentleman
would
not
keep
her
away
from
her
uncle
for
do
you
know
nurse
i
like
uncle
edward
so
much
better
when
he
is
in
bed
he
looks
so
sad
and
speaks
so
softly
i
wish
i
could
sit
with
him
every
day
major
lovell
was
a
distant
cousin
of
sir
edward
and
there
existed
a
warm
friendship
between
them
the
very
brightness
of
his
tone
seemed
to
do
the
invalid
good
and
milly
was
quite
delighted
to
find
that
her
uncle
visitor
not
only
listened
with
interest
to
the
account
of
her
favorite
games
and
pastimes
but
insisted
upon
joining
her
in
them
and
the
walls
of
the
quiet
old
house
rang
again
with
merry
mirth
and
laughter
such
as
they
had
not
known
for
years
upstairs
in
the
sick
room
major
lovell
proved
a
wonderfully
patient
and
skillful
nurse
but
there
were
times
when
all
his
bright
cheeriness
could
not
smooth
the
furrows
in
the
invalid
brow
or
take
away
the
fretfulness
of
tone
one
morning
major
lovell
came
down
from
an
interview
with
him
with
a
puzzled
expression
of
face
catching
sight
of
milly
in
the
hall
equipped
in
hat
and
jacket
he
asked
are
you
going
out
with
nurse
no
nurse
is
busy
just
by
my
own
self
in
the
avenue
with
fritz
do
come
with
me
the
major
consented
but
with
a
graver
face
than
usual
and
then
suddenly
very
full
of
his
own
thoughts
said
to
the
child
i
believe
your
uncle
has
something
on
his
mind
it
strikes
me
from
different
things
he
has
let
drop
that
he
is
turning
pious
what
is
pious
inquired
milly
instantly
what
is
it
a
pious
person
thinks
every
one
wicked
but
themselves
and
condemns
everybody
and
everything
all
round
them
they
are
most
objectionable
people
little
woman
so
mind
you
never
take
up
that
line
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
they
so
satisfied
with
their
own
goodness
that
you
ca
crush
them
try
as
much
as
you
may
and
is
uncle
edward
going
to
be
like
them
asked
the
child
with
a
perplexed
face
i
devoutly
hope
not
i
shall
do
all
in
my
power
to
prevent
it
what
do
pious
people
do
questioned
milly
do
they
give
tracts
away
and
sing
hymns
and
pull
long
faces
over
very
bibles
i
like
singing
hymns
asserted
milly
very
emphatically
everybody
sings
hymns
to
god
do
they
i
listen
to
the
birds
sometimes
and
wish
i
could
sing
like
them
and
the
trees
sing
and
the
bees
and
flies
everything
seems
to
sing
out
of
doors
in
the
summer
time
but
nearly
all
dropped
asleep
now
till
next
year
what
hymns
do
you
sing
major
lovell
bless
the
child
what
do
you
take
me
for
and
the
major
laughed
heartily
as
he
spoke
then
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
he
went
on
gravely
i
shall
begin
to
think
that
you
are
pious
if
you
do
take
care
what
else
do
you
do
besides
sing
hymns
i
have
a
bible
said
milly
solemnly
and
i
just
love
it
and
what
makes
you
love
such
a
dry
book
as
the
bible
you
understand
a
word
of
it
oh
i
can
major
lovell
it
beautiful
i
love
nurse
to
read
and
read
it
to
me
it
tells
about
jesus
you
know
and
i
love
jesus
and
he
loves
me
and
it
has
such
nice
stories
in
it
major
lovell
gave
a
long
low
whistle
ah
he
said
shaking
his
head
comically
at
the
little
figure
walking
by
his
side
i
very
much
afraid
you
may
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
do
you
read
the
bible
to
your
uncle
do
you
tell
him
that
he
has
been
wasting
his
life
and
not
fulfilling
the
end
for
which
he
was
created
in
fact
that
he
is
a
wicked
sinner
for
that
has
been
the
substance
of
his
talk
with
me
this
morning
uncle
edward
is
a
very
good
man
milly
replied
warmly
i
do
know
what
you
mean
major
lovell
do
you
read
the
bible
what
will
you
think
of
me
if
i
tell
you
i
do
perhaps
you
know
it
all
by
heart
i
expect
that
is
why
i
rather
think
i
do
you
must
not
begin
to
catechise
me
too
severely
who
has
brought
you
up
in
this
pious
fashion
i
not
pious
you
said
they
were
horrid
people
but
i
thought
all
the
people
read
the
bible
except
people
like
jack
who
is
jack
he
was
a
prodigal
son
one
of
god
prodigal
sons
and
what
are
they
may
i
ask
milly
did
not
answer
for
a
minute
then
she
stopped
short
and
said
very
solemnly
raising
her
large
dark
eyes
to
the
major
face
i
wonder
if
you
a
prodigal
son
uncle
edward
said
there
were
some
rich
ones
have
you
run
away
from
god
major
lovell
oh
come
now
said
the
major
pinching
her
cheek
i
did
bargain
for
this
when
i
came
out
with
you
you
must
keep
your
sermons
for
some
one
else
come
along
to
the
stables
with
me
and
i
will
give
you
a
ride
in
an
instant
milly
gravity
disappeared
and
a
little
time
afterwards
she
was
laughing
gleefully
as
she
was
being
trotted
round
the
on
a
large
bay
mare
but
she
said
to
her
nurse
when
she
came
in
major
lovell
is
very
nice
but
very
funny
and
i
ca
always
understand
his
talk
he
says
such
difficult
things
chapter
viii
he
arose
and
came
to
his
father
major
lovell
stayed
a
week
and
sir
edward
seemed
the
better
for
his
company
as
far
as
his
bodily
health
was
concerned
but
at
heart
he
was
very
wretched
and
his
cousin
influence
was
not
the
sort
to
help
him
now
old
chap
make
haste
and
get
well
and
do
moon
over
yourself
and
your
feelings
and
come
down
to
our
place
for
christmas
wo
you
you
getting
quite
in
the
blues
by
being
so
much
alone
these
were
major
lovell
parting
words
and
sir
edward
responded
no
thanks
i
prefer
being
at
home
this
christmas
why
i
doubt
if
i
shall
leave
my
room
by
that
time
i
am
as
weak
as
a
baby
the
week
before
christmas
sir
edward
was
in
an
easy
chair
in
the
library
and
though
still
an
invalid
was
now
making
rapid
progress
towards
recovery
he
was
conning
over
an
article
he
had
just
written
before
a
blazing
fire
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
a
frown
came
to
his
face
as
he
turned
to
see
who
the
intruder
was
but
disappeared
at
the
sight
of
his
little
niece
rosy
and
breathless
in
garments
and
hugging
a
large
piece
of
holly
in
her
arms
uncle
edward
he
has
come
who
has
come
tommy
he
really
and
truly
has
ford
told
me
just
as
i
came
in
with
nurse
he
heard
it
from
harris
and
harris
heard
it
from
maxwell
himself
he
said
lad
has
come
tell
little
missy
and
ford
says
harris
said
looked
as
if
he
could
dance
a
jig
for
joy
oh
uncle
edward
may
i
go
to
them
nurse
says
it
too
late
but
i
do
want
to
be
there
there
such
a
lot
to
be
done
now
he
has
really
come
and
uncle
edward
may
they
kill
one
of
the
cows
in
the
farm
that
are
being
fatted
up
there
no
calf
i
afraid
may
they
and
may
i
go
and
tell
them
so
you
will
let
me
go
wo
you
illustration
hugging
a
large
piece
of
holly
in
her
arms
most
certainly
not
it
is
much
too
late
in
the
afternoon
for
you
to
be
going
down
there
it
is
getting
quite
dark
and
as
to
one
of
my
cattle
being
disposed
of
in
that
way
i
should
not
dream
of
allowing
it
for
one
moment
milly
eyes
filled
with
tears
which
she
vainly
tried
to
restrain
when
her
uncle
spoke
to
her
in
that
tone
she
knew
it
was
useless
to
remonstrate
they
be
having
the
feast
without
me
she
said
with
a
little
sob
in
her
voice
maxwell
promised
me
i
should
be
there
when
they
had
it
and
i
longing
to
see
tommy
then
if
maxwell
promised
you
that
she
will
put
off
her
feast
till
said
sir
edward
in
a
softer
tone
and
now
be
a
sensible
little
woman
and
wait
patiently
till
the
time
comes
you
may
be
sure
his
parents
will
like
to
have
him
to
themselves
the
first
night
run
away
now
i
do
want
to
be
disturbed
poor
little
milly
crept
out
of
the
room
feeling
very
crestfallen
and
a
short
time
after
was
lying
on
the
before
the
nursery
fire
her
arms
wound
round
fritz
neck
confiding
to
him
the
whole
story
and
comforting
herself
by
conjecturing
how
and
where
the
meeting
had
taken
place
her
little
mind
was
so
full
of
the
subject
that
it
was
long
before
nurse
could
get
her
to
sleep
that
night
her
last
words
before
she
dropped
off
were
i
wonder
who
will
do
the
music
and
dancing
the
next
morning
the
instant
her
breakfast
was
over
milly
obtained
nurse
permission
to
go
down
to
the
keeper
cottage
under
charge
of
sarah
the
nursery
maid
she
was
away
the
whole
morning
and
about
one
a
message
came
from
maxwell
to
ask
if
she
might
stay
to
dinner
with
them
so
that
it
was
not
till
nearly
four
in
the
afternoon
that
she
was
brought
up
to
the
house
and
then
flushed
and
excited
she
poured
into
her
nurse
ear
a
long
account
of
all
that
she
had
been
hearing
and
doing
now
come
my
dear
you
must
talk
forever
was
nurse
remonstrance
at
last
sir
edward
told
me
i
could
send
you
to
him
for
a
little
when
you
came
in
and
i
must
make
you
tidy
first
it
was
quite
dusk
when
milly
entered
the
library
but
the
bright
firelight
showed
her
the
figure
of
her
uncle
leaning
back
in
his
easy
chair
and
indulging
in
a
reverie
well
he
said
looking
round
where
have
you
been
all
day
down
at
maxwell
i
suppose
yes
said
milly
sedately
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
if
you
like
may
i
make
myself
comfortable
first
and
after
a
minute
hesitation
she
climbed
into
the
heavy
armchair
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fireplace
making
a
pretty
picture
as
she
leaned
her
curly
head
back
on
the
cushion
and
gazed
earnestly
into
her
uncle
face
we
will
have
a
crack
together
uncle
that
what
maxwell
calls
it
when
maxwell
and
i
talk
over
the
fire
may
i
tell
you
all
about
tommy
now
you
may
was
the
amused
reply
well
you
know
i
ran
as
fast
as
i
could
down
to
the
wood
this
morning
and
sarah
ran
after
me
and
maxwell
saw
me
coming
and
she
ran
to
the
door
i
was
rather
out
of
breath
you
see
so
she
just
smoothed
me
down
a
little
and
we
kissed
each
other
and
she
cried
a
tiny
bit
for
i
felt
her
tears
on
my
face
then
she
took
me
in
to
see
tommy
maxwell
was
out
and
tommy
was
in
the
kitchen
in
one
of
maxwell
and
he
was
eating
some
bacon
at
the
table
for
his
breakfast
he
got
up
when
he
saw
me
he
a
nice
big
man
uncle
but
i
think
his
hair
wants
cutting
we
shook
hands
and
i
told
him
i
been
expecting
him
ever
so
long
he
looked
rather
shy
but
after
he
had
quite
finished
his
breakfast
we
had
a
very
nice
talk
and
maxwell
went
bustling
about
getting
dinner
ready
tommy
told
me
all
about
himself
from
the
very
beginning
but
i
really
quite
forget
some
of
it
he
never
kept
any
pigs
at
all
but
he
kept
some
sheep
instead
he
went
out
to
america
and
did
it
and
then
he
was
a
railway
man
and
then
he
had
a
fever
and
then
he
got
into
bad
company
and
at
last
he
came
to
london
and
he
was
an
omnibus
man
there
and
then
a
cabman
and
then
he
drank
too
much
beer
and
his
money
all
went
away
and
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
and
so
he
would
write
home
and
then
he
smashed
his
cab
against
the
and
then
he
drank
too
much
again
i
do
think
you
need
tell
me
any
more
of
his
misdoings
said
sir
edward
drily
but
you
see
he
had
to
get
very
bad
before
he
got
good
because
he
was
a
prodigal
son
and
he
is
sorry
now
he
said
he
never
never
would
have
come
home
until
he
was
a
good
man
only
one
day
he
listened
to
a
man
preaching
a
sermon
in
the
middle
of
a
street
on
a
sunday
night
and
he
felt
uncomfortable
and
then
he
was
spoken
to
after
by
now
guess
uncle
who
do
you
think
sir
edward
could
not
guess
so
milly
went
on
triumphantly
why
it
was
my
jack
and
he
began
to
talk
to
him
and
told
him
he
was
like
him
once
and
he
said
he
was
looking
out
for
a
tommy
maxwell
now
was
that
wonderful
when
it
was
tommy
himself
he
spoke
to
well
tommy
said
he
had
the
face
to
go
home
till
he
was
better
but
jack
told
him
not
to
wait
a
day
longer
for
his
father
and
mother
were
waiting
for
him
but
the
strange
thing
was
that
even
then
tommy
waited
a
whole
two
weeks
before
he
made
up
his
mind
to
come
now
do
you
think
he
was
foolish
uncle
very
foolish
i
could
quite
understand
it
but
nurse
says
there
are
lots
of
people
like
that
waiting
to
make
themselves
better
instead
of
running
home
just
as
they
are
she
says
some
of
god
prodigal
sons
do
that
do
you
think
many
do
uncle
i
daresay
and
tommy
said
though
he
wanted
to
see
his
home
again
dreadfully
he
had
a
great
fight
with
himself
to
come
at
all
i
did
know
prodigal
sons
found
it
so
difficult
the
one
in
the
bible
did
not
when
he
once
made
up
his
mind
well
and
so
tommy
got
out
at
the
station
sorry
he
came
by
train
but
jack
uncle
paid
for
his
ticket
i
would
rather
he
had
run
the
whole
way
why
would
you
asked
sir
edward
with
a
smile
i
think
it
would
have
been
more
proper
if
he
had
said
the
child
slowly
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
as
she
gazed
thoughtfully
into
the
fire
i
always
run
or
walk
the
whole
way
when
i
play
the
prodigal
son
i
begin
rather
slowly
because
it
looks
a
long
way
off
but
when
i
come
near
i
hurry
i
wanting
to
be
there
when
i
see
my
home
the
prodigal
son
did
have
a
train
in
the
bible
and
i
think
tommy
might
have
tried
to
do
without
it
the
tone
of
reproach
at
the
end
of
her
speech
was
too
much
for
her
uncle
gravity
and
he
laughed
aloud
i
am
afraid
tommy
has
sadly
disappointed
you
did
he
take
a
cab
from
the
station
no
he
did
do
that
he
got
home
in
the
afternoon
and
maxwell
was
cleaning
his
gun
on
the
doorstep
when
he
saw
a
shadow
and
he
looked
up
and
there
he
was
oh
i
should
like
to
have
been
there
but
i
sorry
to
say
maxwell
did
fall
on
his
neck
and
kiss
him
i
asked
tommy
very
carefully
about
it
and
he
said
he
took
hold
of
both
his
hands
and
squeezed
them
tight
and
he
gave
a
shout
and
maxwell
was
doing
her
washing
in
the
back
yard
and
she
heard
it
and
she
shook
all
over
so
that
she
could
hardly
walk
she
cried
so
much
when
she
saw
tommy
that
maxwell
had
to
pat
her
on
the
back
and
give
her
a
glass
of
water
and
tommy
he
sat
down
on
the
little
seat
inside
the
porch
and
he
said
these
were
his
very
words
uncle
ai
fit
to
come
home
father
i
a
disgrace
to
your
name
and
maxwell
tommy
told
me
she
just
took
his
head
between
her
two
hands
and
drew
it
to
rest
on
her
shoulder
and
then
she
bent
down
and
kissed
him
all
over
and
she
said
boy
who
should
you
come
to
when
you
are
in
disgrace
and
trouble
but
your
own
father
and
mother
tommy
said
when
he
told
me
this
fair
broke
my
heart
miss
and
then
he
gave
a
great
sob
and
i
began
to
cry
and
then
maxwell
came
up
and
her
hands
were
all
floury
for
she
was
making
an
apple
pudding
and
she
cried
too
and
then
we
all
cried
together
at
least
tommy
turned
his
head
away
and
pretended
he
did
but
i
saw
he
did
milly
paused
for
breath
and
her
eyes
looked
wistfully
into
the
glowing
coals
before
her
i
did
know
prodigal
sons
were
sad
when
they
came
back
but
tommy
seemed
so
sad
that
he
made
me
sad
too
why
do
you
think
tommy
cried
uncle
sir
edward
did
not
reply
he
was
gazing
dreamily
into
the
fire
and
something
of
the
wistfulness
in
his
little
niece
face
seemed
to
be
reflected
in
his
he
gave
a
start
after
a
moment
silence
eh
child
what
are
you
saying
have
you
finished
your
story
why
no
uncle
not
nearly
are
you
tired
nurse
said
i
must
not
tire
you
too
much
sir
edward
laughed
but
it
was
not
a
happy
laugh
oh
finish
your
story
by
all
means
little
woman
he
said
and
milly
continued
we
all
cheered
up
when
maxwell
asked
me
if
i
like
to
stay
to
dinner
i
asked
if
it
was
the
feast
and
she
laughed
and
said
she
had
a
roast
leg
of
pork
in
the
oven
with
some
stuffing
and
apple
sauce
and
uncle
it
was
lovely
maxwell
came
in
just
in
time
and
he
looked
so
happy
and
then
we
all
sat
down
to
dinner
but
i
asked
maxwell
to
say
first
before
we
began
us
eat
and
be
merry
for
this
my
son
was
dead
and
is
alive
again
he
was
lost
and
is
he
folded
his
hands
and
said
it
like
grace
and
maxwell
said
when
he
had
finished
and
wiped
her
eyes
with
her
apron
i
told
them
we
must
all
be
very
merry
but
tommy
was
i
afraid
he
kept
looking
first
at
maxwell
and
then
all
round
the
kitchen
and
then
at
maxwell
and
then
he
sighed
very
big
sighs
he
said
he
could
believe
he
was
at
home
but
he
told
me
when
i
asked
him
quietly
afterwards
that
he
was
really
very
happy
he
only
sighed
and
looked
sad
because
he
thought
how
foolish
he
had
been
to
stay
away
so
long
i
was
very
sorry
for
one
thing
about
him
uncle
he
was
in
his
best
clothes
they
were
all
too
small
for
him
and
the
slippers
would
fit
him
but
maxwell
says
he
will
buy
him
some
new
ones
and
tommy
told
me
he
would
wear
a
ring
if
he
had
one
he
asked
me
why
he
should
so
i
told
him
about
the
prodigal
son
in
the
bible
he
seemed
to
like
hearing
about
it
and
he
said
he
thought
he
was
very
like
him
and
then
i
asked
about
the
music
and
dancing
i
wanted
to
have
that
but
we
could
manage
it
maxwell
said
we
had
music
in
our
hearts
how
can
we
have
that
uncle
i
did
hear
any
in
mine
for
i
kept
silent
and
listened
for
it
i
expect
she
meant
you
were
so
happy
that
you
did
not
want
any
music
to
make
you
happier
i
was
very
happy
oh
uncle
edward
why
wo
all
the
prodigal
sons
go
home
i
ca
think
why
they
like
staying
away
it
is
so
lovely
to
think
of
tommy
now
and
every
one
would
be
just
as
happy
would
they
i
do
think
all
young
men
have
such
fond
parents
as
your
friend
tommy
has
said
sir
edward
gravely
have
they
well
god
prodigal
sons
could
have
a
nicer
father
i
lie
and
think
of
them
when
i
in
bed
sometimes
and
i
talk
to
god
about
them
i
was
so
glad
when
jack
went
back
to
him
i
think
it
is
worst
of
all
to
stay
a
long
way
off
from
god
because
he
does
love
them
so
i
wonder
if
it
is
that
they
do
know
whether
god
will
take
them
back
tommy
seemed
half
afraid
till
he
came
that
his
father
would
be
angry
with
him
i
should
like
to
see
a
prodigal
son
running
back
into
arms
so
much
but
i
suppose
he
does
it
very
quietly
and
only
the
angels
look
down
and
see
it
and
what
is
this
young
scapegrace
going
to
do
now
live
on
his
father
and
mother
or
is
he
going
to
try
and
do
some
honest
work
sir
edward
tone
was
rather
impatient
milly
looked
up
surprised
do
you
mean
tommy
uncle
are
you
angry
with
him
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
look
for
work
directly
and
maxwell
is
coming
up
to
speak
to
you
about
him
ah
i
daresay
wants
him
to
take
the
place
of
i
suppose
and
sir
edward
gave
a
little
grunt
of
dissatisfaction
at
the
thought
chapter
ix
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
when
sir
edward
retired
to
his
room
that
night
he
paced
up
and
down
for
some
time
in
front
of
his
little
niece
picture
that
she
had
given
him
his
brow
was
knitted
and
he
was
thinking
deeply
i
am
longing
to
have
peace
he
muttered
why
can
not
i
make
up
my
mind
to
seek
it
will
ay
easy
to
say
it
a
hard
and
bitter
thing
for
a
backslider
to
retrace
his
steps
how
the
child
stabs
me
sometimes
and
how
little
she
knows
my
past
he
stopped
and
gazed
at
the
picture
and
the
lord
himself
used
this
as
an
illustration
i
could
not
want
anything
stronger
a
sigh
followed
then
a
heartfelt
cry
rose
to
heaven
may
god
have
mercy
on
me
and
bring
me
back
for
i
ca
bring
myself
the
next
morning
sir
edward
had
an
interview
with
his
keeper
who
brought
his
son
up
with
him
and
as
the
tall
young
fellow
stood
before
the
squire
and
in
earnest
humble
tones
asked
if
he
could
be
given
a
chance
of
redeeming
his
character
by
being
employed
on
the
estate
sir
edward
severity
relaxed
and
after
a
long
conversation
with
him
he
promised
he
would
give
him
a
trial
he
smiled
grimly
to
himself
as
father
and
son
left
him
with
warm
expressions
of
gratitude
so
that
is
the
child
hero
one
whose
example
i
might
well
follow
he
has
had
the
courage
at
last
to
take
the
step
from
which
i
am
still
shrinking
why
should
i
fear
that
my
welcome
home
would
be
less
full
of
love
and
forgiveness
than
his
it
was
christmas
eve
a
wild
and
stormy
day
the
wind
raged
ceaselessly
round
the
old
house
howling
down
the
chimneys
and
beating
the
branches
of
the
trees
outside
against
the
window
panes
milly
had
been
very
busy
for
some
hours
helping
ford
to
decorate
the
hall
and
rooms
with
holly
and
evergreen
though
ford
would
every
now
and
then
pause
in
his
work
saying
there
miss
milly
i
sure
we
overdoing
it
if
the
house
was
full
of
company
now
i
would
take
a
pride
in
it
but
i
do
believe
the
master
will
notice
whether
it
done
or
not
it
seems
to
me
as
he
is
getting
more
and
more
shut
up
into
hisself
lately
christmas
is
a
dull
time
with
us
all
was
finished
at
last
and
milly
went
up
to
the
nursery
and
stood
at
the
window
her
bright
brown
eyes
eagerly
scanning
and
taking
note
of
every
object
out
of
doors
it
a
perfect
hurricane
said
nurse
presently
as
she
sat
with
her
work
in
a
comfortable
chair
by
the
fire
if
we
feel
it
inland
like
this
what
must
it
be
at
sea
i
should
like
to
be
on
the
sea
said
milly
i
love
the
wind
but
i
think
it
is
getting
a
little
bit
too
rough
this
afternoon
i
rather
afraid
it
will
hurt
the
little
trees
ford
said
if
i
went
out
i
should
be
blown
away
do
you
think
nurse
if
the
wind
was
very
very
strong
it
would
ever
be
able
to
blow
me
up
to
heaven
i
am
afraid
not
said
nurse
gravely
and
i
do
think
we
could
spare
you
my
dear
you
would
not
like
to
leave
this
world
yet
awhile
sometimes
i
think
i
should
and
sometimes
i
think
i
should
i
think
i
should
like
to
be
blown
up
to
spend
a
day
there
and
then
come
back
again
oh
nurse
goliath
is
screaming
and
cracking
so
i
wish
the
wind
would
knock
him
over
he
is
a
horrid
old
tree
i
always
think
he
is
making
faces
at
me
when
i
run
past
him
would
it
be
nice
to
see
him
blown
down
you
must
wish
that
said
nurse
getting
up
from
her
chair
and
moving
towards
the
door
it
a
dangerous
thing
for
an
old
tree
to
be
blown
down
now
i
am
going
downstairs
for
a
short
time
so
be
a
good
child
and
do
get
into
mischief
while
i
am
away
milly
remained
at
the
window
for
some
minutes
after
nurse
departure
then
her
quick
eyes
noticed
a
poor
wretched
little
kitten
mewing
pitifully
as
she
vainly
tried
to
shelter
herself
from
the
violent
blasts
by
crouching
close
to
a
tree
in
an
instant
without
thought
of
consequences
the
child
darted
to
the
nursery
door
and
down
the
broad
oak
staircase
poor
pussy
i
will
run
and
fetch
her
in
i
expect
she
has
run
away
from
the
kitchen
sir
edward
was
writing
at
his
study
table
when
an
unusually
violent
gust
of
wind
caused
him
to
raise
his
eyes
and
glance
out
of
the
window
there
to
his
amazement
he
saw
under
the
old
oak
tree
on
the
lawn
his
little
niece
her
golden
brown
curls
flying
as
she
battled
with
the
elements
and
struggled
vainly
to
stoop
and
take
the
kitten
in
her
arms
he
started
up
from
his
seat
but
as
he
did
so
a
blast
that
shook
the
house
swept
by
there
was
an
awful
cracking
then
a
crash
and
to
his
horror
a
huge
limb
of
the
old
oak
came
with
an
awful
thud
upon
the
very
spot
where
his
little
niece
was
standing
my
god
save
her
was
his
agonized
cry
as
he
saw
at
the
same
moment
the
little
figure
stagger
and
fall
then
forgetting
his
weakness
and
lack
of
physical
strength
he
dashed
out
of
the
house
and
in
another
instant
was
standing
over
her
his
first
feeling
was
one
of
intense
thankfulness
to
find
that
the
branch
in
falling
could
have
only
slightly
grazed
her
as
she
was
lying
on
the
ground
untouched
by
it
but
as
he
raised
the
motionless
figure
and
noted
a
red
mark
on
her
forehead
which
was
swelling
rapidly
his
heart
sank
within
him
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
carry
her
into
her
house
and
he
was
met
at
the
door
by
nurse
who
wisely
wasted
no
time
in
useless
lamentation
but
set
to
work
at
once
to
restore
animation
to
her
little
charge
her
efforts
were
successful
milly
was
only
slightly
stunned
but
it
had
been
a
miraculous
escape
and
had
the
blow
been
an
inch
nearer
her
temple
it
might
have
been
fatal
as
it
was
the
child
was
more
frightened
than
hurt
and
when
a
little
time
after
her
uncle
took
her
in
his
arms
with
unwonted
tenderness
she
clung
to
him
and
burst
into
passionate
sobs
take
care
of
me
uncle
that
nasty
old
goliath
he
tried
to
kill
me
he
did
i
saw
him
coming
on
the
top
of
me
god
only
just
saved
me
in
time
did
he
when
the
bruise
had
been
bathed
and
dressed
by
nurse
sir
edward
still
kept
her
on
his
knee
and
after
nurse
had
left
the
room
and
the
child
rested
her
little
head
on
his
shoulder
in
a
very
subdued
frame
of
mind
he
did
what
he
had
never
done
yet
stooped
over
her
and
kissed
her
saying
you
have
been
very
near
death
this
afternoon
little
one
and
i
could
ill
have
spared
you
milly
raised
her
large
dark
eyes
to
his
if
i
had
died
i
should
have
gone
straight
up
to
god
should
i
yes
you
would
i
should
have
liked
that
i
suppose
he
does
want
me
yet
or
he
would
have
sent
for
me
when
she
came
down
to
her
uncle
that
evening
she
raised
a
very
sad
little
face
to
his
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
uncle
edward
have
you
heard
who
goliath
really
did
kill
do
you
mean
the
tree
that
came
on
you
no
one
else
was
hurt
i
hope
and
sir
edward
tone
was
a
little
anxious
she
was
killed
dead
quite
dead
and
mangled
nurse
said
it
was
the
poor
little
kitten
uncle
that
i
ran
out
to
fetch
the
brown
eyes
were
swimming
with
tears
and
milly
could
not
understand
the
smile
that
came
to
sir
edward
lips
only
a
kitten
well
it
was
sad
i
daresay
but
there
are
plenty
of
kittens
about
the
place
but
uncle
i
been
thinking
so
much
about
this
one
ford
says
she
had
run
away
from
the
stable
i
expect
she
was
going
to
be
a
prodigal
kitten
perhaps
and
now
she
never
run
away
any
more
it
so
sad
about
her
and
i
think
why
it
is
sad
is
because
nobody
cares
not
even
nurse
she
said
she
would
rather
it
had
been
the
kitten
than
me
poor
little
kitty
her
mother
will
be
missing
her
so
do
you
think
uncle
the
wind
or
goliath
killed
her
i
think
it
was
goliath
i
just
looked
out
of
my
window
on
the
stairs
before
i
came
down
the
wind
has
stopped
now
and
the
trees
seemed
to
be
crying
and
sobbing
together
sure
they
were
sorry
for
kitty
i
think
they
were
tired
out
themselves
too
they
have
been
so
knocked
about
i
wish
so
much
i
had
been
just
in
time
to
save
the
dear
little
kitten
we
will
not
talk
about
her
any
more
said
sir
edward
cheerfully
have
you
seen
tom
maxwell
lately
milly
little
tongue
was
only
too
ready
to
talk
of
him
he
helped
nurse
and
me
to
get
some
holly
in
the
wood
yesterday
i
have
nice
talks
with
him
often
he
says
he
is
very
happy
and
this
will
be
the
best
christmas
he
has
spent
in
his
life
uncle
i
want
to
ask
you
something
i
been
thinking
of
it
a
great
deal
only
since
i
was
knocked
down
this
afternoon
i
had
such
a
pain
in
my
head
i
left
off
thinking
but
i
just
remembered
it
now
you
see
it
is
really
jesus
christ
birthday
and
i
was
thinking
i
been
getting
presents
for
every
one
in
the
house
but
him
nurse
has
been
helping
me
with
some
of
them
i
made
nurse
a
kettleholder
and
cook
a
needlebook
and
i
bought
a
penknife
for
ford
and
a
thimble
for
sarah
and
some
handkerchiefs
for
maxwell
and
maxwell
and
some
woolen
gloves
for
tommy
and
i
nothing
no
nothing
for
him
if
i
only
knew
something
he
would
like
she
paused
and
a
soft
wistfulness
came
into
her
eyes
i
was
thinking
she
went
on
that
perhaps
i
could
put
my
present
for
him
outside
the
nursery
window
on
the
ledge
and
then
when
we
are
all
in
bed
and
it
is
very
quiet
i
expect
he
might
send
an
angel
down
to
bring
it
up
to
him
i
think
he
might
do
that
because
he
knows
how
much
i
want
to
give
him
something
but
then
i
do
know
what
to
give
him
could
you
tell
me
uncle
i
think
said
sir
edward
gravely
the
only
way
you
can
give
him
a
christmas
present
is
to
give
something
to
the
poor
he
would
rather
have
that
i
will
give
you
this
to
put
in
the
plate
in
church
and
sir
edward
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
rolled
a
coin
across
the
table
to
his
little
niece
but
milly
was
not
satisfied
this
is
your
present
she
said
doubtfully
what
will
you
give
him
this
christmas
besides
is
money
the
only
thing
you
can
give
him
uncle
sir
edward
pushed
back
his
chair
and
rose
from
the
table
his
feelings
were
almost
getting
beyond
his
control
with
the
one
subject
that
was
now
always
foremost
in
his
thoughts
the
child
question
rang
again
in
his
ears
is
money
the
only
thing
you
can
give
him
uncle
and
like
a
flash
of
light
came
a
reply
no
i
can
give
myself
back
to
him
my
soul
and
body
that
have
now
been
so
long
in
the
keeping
of
his
enemy
after
a
few
minutes
silence
he
said
in
a
strangely
quiet
voice
come
little
one
it
is
bedtime
say
and
run
up
to
nurse
milly
came
up
to
him
and
as
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
warming
his
hands
she
took
hold
of
the
ends
of
his
coat
in
her
little
hands
and
looking
up
at
him
said
uncle
edward
you
gave
me
a
kiss
like
a
father
might
have
done
this
afternoon
would
you
mind
very
much
giving
me
another
sir
edward
looked
down
at
the
sweet
little
face
raised
so
coaxingly
to
his
and
then
took
her
up
in
his
arms
but
after
he
had
given
her
the
desired
kiss
he
said
with
some
effort
i
want
you
to
do
something
little
one
when
you
say
your
prayers
ask
that
one
of
god
prodigal
sons
may
be
brought
back
this
christmas
time
it
is
one
who
wants
to
return
will
you
pray
for
him
yes
uncle
replied
the
child
softly
and
will
you
tell
me
his
name
no
i
can
not
do
that
something
in
his
face
made
his
little
niece
refrain
from
asking
further
questions
she
left
him
a
moment
later
and
sir
edward
went
to
the
and
seated
himself
in
a
chair
by
the
fire
the
chimes
of
the
village
church
were
ringing
out
merrily
and
presently
outside
in
the
avenue
a
little
company
of
carol
singers
were
singing
the
sweet
old
christmas
truths
that
none
can
hear
untouched
to
god
in
the
highest
and
on
earth
peace
good
will
toward
a
sense
of
the
love
of
god
seemed
to
surround
his
soul
and
this
verse
came
into
his
mind
as
he
mused
have
loved
thee
with
an
everlasting
love
therefore
with
have
i
drawn
could
he
not
trace
in
the
events
of
the
last
few
months
the
hand
of
a
loving
father
gently
calling
his
wanderer
home
stricken
down
himself
placed
on
a
sick
bed
for
reflection
brought
to
the
edge
of
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
and
then
tenderly
restored
to
life
and
health
the
gentle
voice
and
life
of
a
little
child
pleading
with
him
day
by
day
and
that
life
having
so
lately
been
miraculously
preserved
from
a
great
danger
all
this
filled
his
heart
with
the
realization
of
the
mercy
and
of
god
and
when
again
the
past
came
up
before
him
and
the
tempter
drew
near
again
with
the
old
refrain
you
have
wandered
too
long
you
have
hardened
your
heart
and
god
has
shut
his
ear
to
your
cry
sir
edward
by
the
help
and
power
of
the
divine
spirit
was
able
to
look
up
and
say
from
the
depths
of
his
heart
i
have
sinned
against
heaven
and
in
thy
sight
and
am
no
more
worthy
to
be
called
thy
son
they
were
sitting
in
the
study
the
next
afternoon
the
child
upon
his
knee
when
sir
edward
said
suddenly
do
you
know
that
i
have
received
a
letter
about
you
who
from
asked
milly
with
interest
from
my
sister
your
aunt
in
australia
i
wrote
to
her
when
you
came
and
she
wants
to
have
you
out
there
and
bring
you
up
among
her
own
children
she
says
a
friend
of
hers
will
take
charge
of
you
and
take
you
to
her
next
month
i
must
talk
to
nurse
about
it
the
little
hands
clutched
hold
of
his
coat
sleeve
tightly
but
not
a
word
did
milly
say
sir
edward
noted
a
slight
quivering
of
the
lips
and
a
piteous
gleam
in
the
soft
brown
eyes
he
waited
in
silence
for
a
moment
then
said
cheerfully
wo
you
be
glad
to
have
a
lot
of
boys
and
girls
to
play
with
instead
of
staying
here
with
a
lonely
old
man
still
the
child
said
nothing
but
suddenly
down
went
the
curly
head
upon
his
arm
and
the
tears
came
thick
and
fast
sir
edward
raised
the
little
face
to
his
we
must
not
have
tears
on
christmas
day
he
said
what
is
the
matter
do
you
want
to
go
i
suppose
i
must
sobbed
milly
ford
told
nurse
the
day
i
came
that
you
hated
children
i
always
been
thinking
of
it
but
you
have
been
so
kind
to
me
that
i
thought
perhaps
he
had
made
a
little
mistake
miss
kent
did
want
me
and
now
you
do
want
me
and
perhaps
my
aunt
wo
want
me
when
i
get
there
i
wish
god
wanted
me
but
i
afraid
he
does
nurse
says
she
thinks
he
wants
me
to
work
for
him
when
i
grow
up
i
think
i
think
i
rather
like
the
little
kitten
yesterday
that
nobody
was
sorry
for
when
she
died
you
said
there
were
plenty
more
kittens
did
you
i
do
think
there
are
plenty
of
small
millicents
in
this
world
and
sir
edward
voice
was
husky
now
listen
little
woman
i
have
been
thinking
over
the
matter
and
have
decided
this
afternoon
to
keep
you
with
me
i
find
i
do
want
you
after
all
and
can
not
afford
to
lose
you
supposing
we
dry
these
tears
and
talk
about
something
else
and
as
the
little
arms
were
thrown
round
his
neck
and
a
face
full
of
smiles
and
tears
like
an
april
shower
was
lifted
to
his
the
confirmed
old
bachelor
took
to
his
heart
the
little
maiden
whose
very
existence
had
so
annoyed
and
distressed
him
only
a
few
months
before
uncle
edward
she
said
a
little
time
after
do
you
know
if
that
prodigal
son
you
told
me
about
last
night
has
come
back
to
god
sir
edward
was
silent
for
a
minute
then
very
gravely
and
solemnly
he
said
i
think
he
has
little
one
it
has
been
a
very
happy
christmas
day
to
him
and
you
must
pray
now
that
he
may
not
be
ashamed
to
own
his
lord
who
has
so
mercifully
brought
him
back
through
the
instrumentality
of
one
of
his
lambs
