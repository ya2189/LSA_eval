the
unspeakable
gentleman
by
marquand
i
i
have
seen
the
improbable
turn
true
too
often
not
to
have
it
disturb
me
suppose
these
memoirs
still
exist
when
the
french
royalist
plot
of
and
my
father
peculiar
role
in
it
are
forgotten
i
can
not
help
but
remember
it
is
a
restless
land
across
the
water
but
surely
people
will
continue
to
recollect
surely
these
few
pages
written
with
the
sole
purpose
of
explaining
my
father
part
in
the
affair
will
not
degenerate
into
anything
so
pitifully
fanciful
as
the
story
of
a
man
who
tried
his
best
to
be
a
bad
example
because
he
could
not
be
a
good
one
it
was
my
uncle
jason
who
was
with
me
when
i
learned
of
my
return
to
america
i
still
remember
the
look
of
sympathetic
concern
on
his
broad
face
as
i
read
my
father
letter
there
was
anxiety
written
there
as
he
watched
me
for
my
uncle
was
a
kindly
thoughtful
man
for
the
moment
he
seemed
to
have
quite
forgotten
the
affairs
of
his
counting
house
and
the
inventory
of
goods
from
france
which
a
clerk
had
placed
before
him
of
late
he
had
taken
in
me
an
unaccustomed
interest
in
no
wise
allayed
by
the
letter
i
was
holding
so
he
is
here
said
my
uncle
jason
he
is
just
arrived
i
answered
i
had
heard
of
it
he
remarked
thoughtfully
and
you
will
see
him
henry
yes
i
replied
since
she
asked
me
to
she
had
asked
you
your
mother
you
did
not
tell
me
that
his
voice
had
been
sharp
and
reproachful
and
then
he
had
sighed
after
all
he
went
on
more
gently
he
is
your
father
and
you
must
respect
him
as
such
henry
hard
as
it
is
to
do
so
i
am
sorry
almost
that
he
and
i
have
quarreled
for
in
many
ways
your
father
was
a
remarkable
man
who
might
have
gone
far
except
for
his
failing
god
knows
i
did
my
best
to
help
him
and
he
sighed
again
at
the
small
success
of
his
efforts
and
returned
to
the
papers
that
lay
before
him
on
the
counting
house
table
his
business
had
become
engrossing
of
late
and
gave
him
little
leisure
do
not
be
too
hard
on
him
henry
he
said
as
i
departed
it
was
ten
years
since
i
had
seen
my
father
ten
years
when
we
change
more
than
we
do
during
the
rest
of
a
lifetime
ten
years
back
we
had
lived
in
a
great
house
with
lawns
that
ran
down
to
the
river
where
our
ships
pulled
at
their
moorings
my
father
and
i
had
left
the
house
together
i
for
school
and
my
father
i
have
never
learned
where
he
had
gone
i
was
just
beginning
to
see
the
starker
outlines
of
a
world
that
has
shaken
off
the
shadows
of
youth
when
i
saw
him
again
i
remember
it
was
a
morning
early
in
autumn
the
wind
was
fresh
off
the
sea
making
the
pounding
of
the
surf
on
the
beach
seem
very
near
as
i
urged
my
horse
from
the
neat
quiet
streets
of
the
town
up
the
rutted
lane
that
led
to
the
shelton
house
the
tang
of
the
salt
marshes
was
in
the
wind
and
a
touch
of
frost
over
the
meadows
told
me
the
ducks
would
soon
be
coming
in
from
shelter
already
the
leaves
were
falling
off
the
tall
elms
twisting
in
little
spirals
through
the
clear
october
sunlight
and
yet
in
spite
of
the
wind
and
the
sea
and
the
clean
light
of
the
forenoon
there
was
a
sadness
about
the
place
and
an
undercurrent
of
uneasy
silence
that
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
and
the
noise
of
the
surf
only
seemed
to
accentuate
it
was
like
the
silence
that
falls
about
a
table
when
the
guests
have
left
it
and
the
chairs
are
empty
and
the
lights
are
growing
dim
it
was
the
silence
that
comes
over
all
places
where
there
should
be
people
and
yet
where
no
one
comes
the
shrubbery
my
grandfather
had
brought
from
england
was
more
wild
and
disordered
than
when
i
had
seen
it
last
the
weeds
had
choked
the
formal
garden
that
once
grew
before
the
front
door
and
the
house
i
had
often
pictured
that
house
in
my
memory
with
its
great
arched
doorway
its
windows
and
its
gambrel
roof
once
it
had
seemed
to
me
a
massive
and
majestic
structure
now
those
ten
years
had
made
it
shrink
to
a
lonely
crumbling
building
that
overlooked
the
harbor
mouth
clematis
had
swarmed
over
the
bricks
a
tangle
of
dead
and
living
vines
the
paint
was
chipping
from
the
doors
and
window
ledges
here
and
there
a
shutter
had
broken
loose
and
was
sagging
on
rusted
hinges
houses
are
apt
to
follow
the
direction
their
owners
take
i
knew
i
was
being
watched
though
i
can
not
tell
how
i
knew
it
yet
i
saw
nothing
until
i
was
nearly
at
our
door
i
remember
i
was
noticing
the
green
stain
from
the
brass
knocker
on
its
paneling
when
my
horse
snorted
and
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks
from
the
overgrown
clump
of
lilacs
that
flanked
the
granite
stone
which
served
as
a
something
was
glinting
in
the
sun
and
then
as
i
looked
more
closely
i
saw
a
face
peering
at
me
from
between
the
twigs
a
face
of
light
mahogany
with
thick
lips
that
showed
the
presence
of
negro
blood
it
was
brutus
my
servant
dark
and
saturnine
as
ever
he
glided
out
into
the
path
in
front
of
me
thrusting
something
back
into
the
sash
around
his
waist
moved
toward
me
and
took
my
horse
head
his
teeth
shone
when
i
spoke
to
him
but
he
said
never
a
word
in
return
to
my
greeting
there
was
a
touch
of
indian
in
his
blood
that
made
his
speech
short
and
laconic
nevertheless
he
was
glad
to
see
me
he
grasped
my
shoulder
as
i
dismounted
and
shook
me
gently
from
side
to
side
his
great
form
loomed
before
me
his
lips
framed
in
a
cheerful
grin
his
eyes
appraising
and
friendly
and
then
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
livid
welt
of
a
cut
across
his
cheek
brutus
read
my
glance
but
he
only
shook
his
head
in
answer
what
do
you
mean
hiding
in
those
bushes
i
asked
him
roughly
always
must
see
who
is
coming
said
brutus
monsieur
may
not
want
to
see
who
is
coming
you
understan
no
i
said
i
do
understand
his
grasp
on
my
shoulder
tightened
then
you
go
home
he
said
you
go
home
now
something
happen
monsieur
very
angry
something
bad
you
understan
he
is
in
the
house
i
asked
brutus
nodded
then
take
this
horse
i
said
and
swung
open
the
front
door
a
draft
eddied
through
the
broad
old
hallway
as
i
stepped
over
the
threshold
and
there
was
a
smell
of
wood
smoke
that
told
me
the
chimneys
were
still
cold
from
disuse
someone
had
stored
the
hall
full
of
coils
of
rope
and
sailcloth
but
in
the
midst
of
it
the
same
tall
clock
was
ticking
out
its
cycle
and
the
portraits
of
the
shelton
family
still
hung
against
the
white
panels
the
long
brown
rows
of
books
still
lined
the
walls
of
the
morning
room
the
long
mahogany
table
in
the
center
was
still
littered
with
maps
and
papers
there
were
the
same
rusted
muskets
and
small
swords
in
the
rack
by
the
fireplace
and
in
front
of
the
fire
in
a
great
armchair
my
father
was
sitting
i
paused
with
a
curious
feeling
of
doubt
surprise
and
diffidence
somehow
i
had
pictured
a
different
meeting
and
a
different
man
he
must
surely
have
heard
my
step
and
the
jingling
of
my
spurs
as
i
crossed
the
room
but
he
never
so
much
as
raised
his
head
he
still
rested
leaning
indolently
back
watching
the
flames
dance
up
the
chimney
he
was
dressed
in
gray
satin
small
clothes
that
went
well
with
his
slender
figure
his
wig
was
fresh
powdered
and
his
throat
and
wrists
were
framed
in
spotless
lace
the
care
of
his
person
was
almost
the
only
tribute
he
paid
to
his
past
i
must
have
stood
for
twenty
seconds
watching
him
while
he
watched
the
fire
before
he
turned
and
faced
me
and
when
he
did
i
had
forgotten
the
words
i
had
framed
to
greet
him
i
knew
he
was
preparing
to
meet
a
hard
ordeal
he
knew
as
well
as
i
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
be
glad
to
see
him
yet
he
showed
never
a
trace
of
uncertainty
his
eye
never
wavered
his
lips
were
drawn
in
the
same
supercilious
upward
curve
that
gave
him
the
expression
i
most
often
remembered
ten
years
had
not
done
much
to
change
him
the
pallor
i
had
remembered
on
his
features
had
been
burned
off
by
a
tropical
sun
that
was
all
there
was
hardly
a
wrinkle
about
his
eyes
hardly
a
crease
in
his
high
forehead
wherever
he
had
been
whatever
he
had
done
his
serenity
was
still
unshaken
it
still
lay
over
him
placid
and
impenetrable
and
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
cool
and
impassive
and
cast
in
pleasant
modulation
so
you
are
here
he
remarked
as
though
he
were
weighing
each
word
carefully
and
why
did
you
come
i
think
i
told
you
in
my
letter
there
was
no
need
unless
you
wished
there
was
something
cold
and
unfriendly
in
his
speech
i
tried
in
vain
to
fight
down
a
rising
feeling
of
antagonism
a
vague
sense
of
disappointment
for
a
moment
we
glanced
at
each
other
coldly
i
think
sir
i
answered
from
a
sense
of
curiosity
almost
as
soon
as
i
had
spoken
i
was
sorry
for
some
sixth
sense
told
me
i
had
hurt
him
with
a
lithe
effortless
grace
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
faced
me
and
his
smile
half
amused
half
tolerant
curved
his
lips
again
i
should
have
known
you
would
be
frank
he
said
your
letter
my
son
refusing
to
accept
my
remittances
should
have
taught
me
as
much
but
we
grow
forgetful
as
our
feet
weary
of
the
path
of
life
yet
i
remember
thinking
that
few
people
looked
less
weary
than
my
father
as
he
stood
there
watching
me
the
primroses
it
seemed
had
afforded
pleasant
footing
i
believe
he
read
my
thoughts
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
for
an
instant
genuine
amusement
was
written
in
his
glance
but
there
were
few
genuine
emotions
he
allowed
free
play
perhaps
he
suggested
pleasantly
it
would
interest
you
to
know
why
i
have
returned
to
these
rather
rigorous
and
uncongenial
surroundings
if
not
i
beg
you
to
be
frank
again
henry
there
nothing
that
i
dread
more
than
being
stupid
sir
i
objected
i
told
you
i
was
curious
to
be
sure
you
did
he
admitted
can
it
be
possible
that
i
am
becoming
henry
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
very
flattering
can
you
believe
it
it
is
largely
on
your
account
that
i
consented
to
revisit
these
familiar
scenes
no
i
said
i
can
not
sir
since
you
ask
me
my
father
shrugged
his
shoulders
far
be
it
from
me
to
overstrain
your
credulity
my
son
he
observed
blandly
let
us
admit
then
there
was
also
some
slight
factor
of
expedience
but
slight
henry
almost
negligible
in
fact
it
happened
that
i
was
in
a
french
port
and
that
while
there
i
should
think
of
you
sir
i
said
you
startle
me
but
he
continued
regardless
of
my
interruption
and
what
should
be
there
also
but
the
ready
to
set
for
home
quite
suddenly
i
determined
to
sail
her
back
i
too
was
curious
my
son
for
a
moment
his
voice
lost
its
bantering
note
curious
he
continued
gravely
to
know
whether
you
were
a
man
like
me
or
one
of
whom
i
might
have
reason
to
be
proud
so
here
we
are
henry
who
said
coincidence
was
the
exception
and
not
the
rule
his
last
words
drifted
gently
away
and
in
their
wake
followed
an
awkward
silence
the
logs
were
hissing
in
the
fire
i
could
hear
the
clock
in
the
hall
outside
and
the
beating
of
the
vines
against
the
window
panes
it
was
no
sound
certainly
that
made
me
whirl
around
to
look
behind
me
some
instinct
that
was
all
there
was
brutus
not
two
feet
from
my
back
with
my
father
cloak
over
his
right
arm
and
my
father
sword
held
in
his
great
fist
do
not
disturb
yourself
brutus
said
my
father
we
are
both
gentlemen
more
or
less
and
will
not
come
to
blows
my
cloak
brutus
i
am
sorry
my
son
that
we
must
wait
till
later
in
the
day
to
exchange
ideas
even
here
in
america
affairs
seem
to
follow
me
will
you
content
yourself
till
evening
there
are
horses
in
the
stable
and
liquors
in
the
cellar
choose
all
or
either
henry
personally
i
find
them
both
amusing
he
stood
motionless
however
even
when
his
dark
cloak
was
adjusted
to
his
shoulders
as
though
some
matters
were
disturbing
him
and
then
he
tapped
his
sword
hilt
with
a
precise
even
motion
of
his
fingers
brutus
he
said
slowly
i
shall
take
my
pistols
also
your
pistols
i
echoed
you
have
forgotten
you
are
back
in
america
he
half
turned
toward
me
and
favored
me
with
a
serene
incurious
glance
on
the
contrary
he
said
i
am
just
beginning
to
remember
and
so
without
further
words
he
left
me
i
followed
him
through
our
rear
doorway
out
over
the
crumbling
bricks
of
our
terrace
which
had
been
built
to
overlook
the
river
and
watched
him
walk
slowly
and
thoughtfully
down
the
path
with
its
border
of
elm
trees
to
his
warehouses
where
a
half
dozen
men
had
already
started
work
the
river
was
dark
blue
under
a
cloudless
sky
the
sunlight
was
playing
in
restless
sparkles
where
the
wind
ruffled
the
water
surface
out
near
the
channel
i
could
see
the
riding
at
anchor
her
decks
littered
with
bales
and
gear
and
the
and
the
trim
and
neat
and
down
deep
in
the
water
as
though
ready
to
put
to
sea
at
the
head
of
our
wharf
were
bales
and
boxes
stacked
in
the
odd
confusion
that
comes
of
a
hasty
discharge
of
cargo
on
the
terrace
where
i
was
standing
i
could
see
the
other
wharves
along
the
waterfront
and
the
church
spires
and
roofs
of
the
town
reared
among
the
trees
that
lined
the
busy
streets
toward
the
sand
dunes
the
marshes
stretched
away
in
russet
gold
into
the
autumn
haze
the
woods
across
the
river
were
bright
patches
of
reds
and
yellows
pleasant
and
inviting
in
the
sunlight
but
i
saw
it
all
with
only
half
an
eye
i
was
still
thinking
of
the
dark
hall
behind
me
and
the
cold
unwelcome
stillness
of
the
shuttered
rooms
i
could
understand
his
depression
now
that
he
had
come
back
to
it
but
there
was
something
else
i
was
still
thinking
of
it
when
i
looked
at
the
again
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
a
craft
of
more
delicate
graceful
lines
they
often
said
he
had
a
flair
for
ships
and
women
a
shifting
current
some
freak
of
the
wind
and
tide
was
making
her
twist
and
pull
at
her
anchor
and
for
a
moment
the
sun
struck
clean
on
her
broadside
a
gaping
hole
between
decks
had
connected
two
of
her
ports
in
a
jagged
rent
it
was
not
surprising
my
father
ships
were
often
fired
on
at
sea
nor
was
it
strange
that
brutus
had
a
scar
on
his
cheek
but
why
had
my
father
gone
armed
to
his
own
wharf
perhaps
i
might
have
forgotten
if
i
had
not
visited
the
stables
our
carriage
harness
still
hung
from
the
pegs
dried
and
twisted
by
the
years
and
minus
its
silver
trimmings
the
sunlight
filtered
through
cracks
in
the
roof
and
danced
through
the
dust
mites
to
the
rows
of
vacant
stalls
near
the
door
my
horse
was
feeding
comfortably
and
beside
him
stood
two
bays
that
shone
from
careful
grooming
one
was
carrying
a
saddle
with
a
pair
of
pistols
in
the
pocket
yet
not
a
hair
had
been
turned
from
riding
ii
i
rode
through
town
that
afternoon
and
it
was
not
entirely
because
time
hung
heavily
on
my
hands
we
were
proud
of
our
town
the
houses
were
as
elegant
and
substantial
as
any
you
could
find
our
streets
were
broad
and
even
our
walks
were
paved
with
brick
there
was
not
a
finer
tavern
than
ours
to
the
north
of
boston
or
better
dressed
men
frequenting
it
men
said
in
those
days
that
we
would
be
a
great
seaport
that
the
world
would
look
more
and
more
to
that
northern
massachusetts
river
mouth
they
had
spoken
thus
of
many
other
harbor
towns
in
the
centuries
that
men
have
gone
down
to
the
sea
i
think
they
have
been
wrong
almost
as
often
as
they
had
predicted
the
ships
have
ceased
to
sail
over
the
bar
no
one
heeds
the
rotting
planking
of
the
wharves
the
clang
of
hammers
and
the
sailors
songs
have
gone
and
trade
and
gain
and
venture
have
gone
with
them
strange
as
i
recall
that
afternoon
they
were
building
a
new
l
to
the
tavern
tradespeople
were
busy
about
their
shops
coaches
newly
painted
and
drawn
by
horses
rolled
by
me
gentlemen
in
bright
new
coats
servants
in
new
family
livery
sailors
from
the
docks
clerks
from
the
counting
houses
all
gave
the
street
a
busy
air
lent
it
a
pleasant
assurance
of
affluence
i
was
mistaken
when
i
thought
i
could
ride
by
as
a
stranger
might
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
no
one
too
busy
to
stop
and
look
to
turn
and
whisper
a
word
to
someone
else
they
had
learned
already
that
i
was
my
father
son
i
could
feel
a
hot
flame
of
anger
burning
my
cheeks
the
old
stinging
passion
of
resentment
i
had
felt
so
often
when
my
name
was
mentioned
they
knew
me
their
looks
alone
told
that
but
never
a
nod
or
smile
of
greeting
marked
my
return
though
i
had
never
spoken
to
them
i
knew
them
all
the
penfields
father
and
son
tall
and
lean
with
bony
faces
and
sandy
hair
and
eyebrows
and
restless
pale
blue
eyes
squire
land
small
and
ascetic
his
lips
constantly
puckered
as
though
he
had
tasted
something
unpleasant
captain
proctor
stouter
than
when
i
had
seen
him
last
with
the
benign
good
nature
that
comes
of
settled
affairs
and
good
living
over
them
and
over
the
town
those
eight
years
had
passed
with
a
light
hand
but
it
was
not
our
town
i
had
come
to
visit
i
found
ned
aiken
as
i
knew
i
should
with
the
in
harbor
he
was
seated
on
his
door
step
by
the
river
road
as
though
he
had
always
been
planted
in
that
very
place
i
remember
expecting
he
would
be
glad
to
see
me
instead
he
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
gazed
at
me
steadily
like
some
steer
stopped
from
grazing
then
he
placed
his
pipe
on
the
stone
step
and
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
squat
and
burly
his
little
eyes
glinting
below
his
greasy
unbraided
hair
his
jaw
protruding
and
ominous
slowly
he
loosened
the
dirty
red
handkerchief
he
kept
swathed
about
his
throat
and
raised
a
stubby
hand
to
push
the
hair
from
his
heavy
forehead
then
his
face
relaxed
into
a
grim
smile
and
he
seated
himself
on
the
step
again
you
changed
since
last
i
saw
you
he
said
changed
remarkable
you
have
why
right
now
i
thought
you
might
be
someone
else
had
brutus
also
been
laboring
under
the
same
delusion
i
told
him
i
was
glad
we
were
still
on
speaking
terms
and
seated
myself
beside
him
he
studied
me
for
a
while
in
silence
leisurely
puffing
at
his
pipe
you
mistook
me
for
someone
i
asked
finally
yes
said
aiken
and
slapped
his
pipe
against
the
palm
of
his
hand
you
been
shootin
up
you
have
since
i
set
eyes
on
you
he
paused
seemingly
struck
by
a
genial
inspiration
yes
shootin
up
still
looking
at
me
he
gave
way
to
a
hoarse
chuckle
why
boy
we
all
been
doing
some
shootin
you
your
dad
and
me
too
since
we
seen
you
last
and
he
was
taken
by
a
paroxysm
of
silent
mirth
now
that
what
i
call
wit
he
gasped
complacently
and
then
he
repeated
in
joyous
encore
you
shootin
me
shootin
he
shootin
you
were
shooting
at
anybody
i
asked
with
casual
innocence
and
why
should
we
be
i
want
to
know
he
demanded
but
his
tongue
showed
no
sign
of
slipping
his
glance
had
resumed
its
old
stolid
watchfulness
which
caused
me
to
remain
tactfully
silent
but
we
was
shootin
at
anybody
aiken
concluded
more
genially
not
at
anybody
just
at
selected
folks
he
stopped
to
glance
serenely
about
him
and
somehow
the
dusty
road
the
river
the
trees
and
the
soft
sunlight
seemed
to
make
him
strangely
confiding
his
harsh
voice
lowered
in
gentle
patronage
would
you
like
to
know
who
those
folks
were
he
asked
finally
i
must
have
been
too
eager
in
giving
my
assent
for
aiken
smiled
broadly
and
nodded
his
head
with
complacent
satisfaction
i
thought
you
would
admire
to
said
aiken
like
as
not
you
give
a
tooth
to
know
now
would
you
never
do
know
a
tooth
is
useful
till
you
lose
it
now
look
at
me
i
had
as
many
as
six
stove
out
off
on
and
now
but
you
wanted
to
know
who
it
was
we
shot
at
did
you
so
you
did
boy
so
you
did
well
i
tell
you
so
i
will
yes
so
help
me
if
i
do
tell
you
boy
and
his
voice
trailed
off
in
a
low
chuckle
it
was
folks
like
you
he
concluded
crisply
folks
who
did
mind
their
own
business
gleefully
he
repeated
the
sentence
its
ringing
cadence
and
the
trend
of
his
whole
discourse
gave
him
evident
pleasure
and
even
caused
him
to
continue
further
with
his
rebuke
there
you
have
it
said
aiken
the
captain
own
words
aiken
he
says
fancy
we
may
meet
a
number
of
people
whose
affairs
will
not
stop
them
interfering
with
our
own
if
you
see
any
he
says
them
mr
aiken
he
had
lapsed
into
a
reminiscent
mood
and
as
he
fixed
his
gaze
on
the
trees
across
the
road
he
was
prompted
to
enlarge
still
further
on
the
episode
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
i
was
there
as
he
continued
i
wish
it
had
been
on
deck
he
remarked
instead
of
a
place
with
damned
gold
chairs
and
gold
on
the
ceiling
and
cloth
on
the
walls
and
velvets
such
as
respectable
folks
use
for
dress
and
not
for
ornament
and
candles
in
gold
sticks
and
the
floor
like
a
sheet
of
ice
hell
said
aiken
i
sooner
slip
on
blood
than
on
a
floor
like
that
yes
so
i
would
i
wonder
why
those
frog
eaters
do
make
their
houses
snug
and
decent
instead
of
big
as
a
church
now
though
i
not
a
moral
man
yet
i
call
it
immoral
damned
if
i
do
to
live
in
a
house
like
that
yet
somehow
pleasant
i
ventured
politely
surely
you
have
found
that
the
beauty
of
most
immoral
things
they
all
seem
to
be
pleasant
am
i
not
right
mr
aiken
he
looked
at
me
sharply
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
denied
me
the
pleasure
of
an
answer
not
that
i
meant
to
puzzle
you
i
added
hastily
but
you
have
sailed
so
long
with
my
father
that
i
considered
you
in
a
position
to
know
now
in
france
aiken
dropped
his
pipe
who
said
anything
about
france
he
demanded
and
did
you
not
i
asked
beginning
to
enjoy
my
visit
surely
you
were
speaking
just
now
about
a
chateau
the
scene
of
some
pleasant
adventure
pray
do
let
me
interrupt
you
a
bead
of
perspiration
rolled
down
aiken
brow
and
he
tightened
his
handkerchief
about
his
throat
as
though
to
stifle
further
conversation
he
sat
silent
for
a
minute
while
his
mind
seemed
to
wander
off
into
a
maze
of
dim
recollections
and
his
eyes
the
better
to
see
the
pictures
that
drifted
through
his
memory
what
am
i
here
ashore
and
sober
for
he
asked
finally
so
i
talk
that
why
and
i
wo
talk
so
there
the
end
of
it
it
just
that
i
have
to
have
my
little
joke
that
all
or
i
would
have
said
anything
about
the
chato
or
the
captain
either
though
if
i
do
say
it
he
added
in
final
justification
there
many
seafaring
men
who
have
a
chance
to
sail
along
of
a
man
like
him
and
how
does
that
happen
i
asked
because
there
ai
any
more
like
him
to
sail
with
he
sat
watching
me
and
the
gap
between
us
seemed
to
widen
he
seemed
to
be
looking
at
me
from
some
great
distance
from
the
end
of
the
road
where
years
and
experience
had
led
him
full
of
thoughts
he
could
never
express
even
if
the
desire
impelled
him
no
not
any
said
aiken
the
dusk
was
beginning
to
gather
when
i
rode
home
the
heavy
purple
dusk
of
autumn
full
of
the
crisp
smell
of
dead
leaves
and
the
low
hanging
wood
smoke
from
the
chimneys
my
father
was
reading
voltaire
beside
a
briskly
burning
fire
closing
his
book
on
his
forefinger
he
waved
me
to
a
chair
beside
him
my
son
he
said
they
mix
better
than
you
think
voltaire
and
gunpowder
have
you
not
found
it
so
i
fear
i
replied
that
my
experience
has
been
too
limited
give
me
time
sir
i
have
only
been
twice
to
sea
next
time
i
shall
remember
to
take
voltaire
with
me
do
he
advised
courteously
you
will
find
it
will
help
with
the
privateers
tide
you
over
every
little
unpleasantness
ah
yes
it
is
advice
worth
following
i
learned
it
long
ago
a
little
difference
of
opinion
and
the
pages
of
the
great
philosopher
he
raised
his
arm
and
glanced
at
it
critically
words
well
placed
is
it
not
wonderful
their
steadying
effect
the
deadly
accuracy
which
their
logic
seems
to
impart
to
the
hand
and
eye
a
man
can
be
dangerous
indeed
with
twenty
pages
of
voltaire
behind
him
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
leaned
forward
to
tap
me
gently
on
the
knee
his
expression
coldly
genial
i
have
read
all
the
works
of
voltaire
henry
read
them
many
times
unbidden
a
picture
of
him
came
before
me
in
a
room
with
gilt
chairs
and
candelabra
whose
glass
pendants
sparkled
in
the
mild
yellow
light
with
a
smell
of
powder
mingling
strangely
with
the
scent
of
flowers
but
why
he
concluded
should
i
be
more
explicit
than
aiken
to
fear
nothing
say
nothing
it
is
a
maxim
followed
by
so
many
politicians
strange
that
it
still
stays
valuable
strange
and
he
waved
his
hand
in
a
negligent
gesture
of
deprecation
why
indeed
be
more
explicit
i
rejoined
your
sudden
interest
is
quite
enough
to
leave
me
overcome
sir
when
after
years
of
neglect
you
see
to
it
i
ride
out
safely
of
an
afternoon
he
tapped
his
snuff
box
thoughtfully
coincidence
again
henry
that
is
all
how
was
i
to
know
you
would
be
outside
ned
aiken
house
while
i
was
within
and
how
should
i
know
that
paternal
care
would
prompt
you
to
remain
within
while
i
was
without
for
a
second
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
father
was
going
to
laugh
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
something
like
astonishment
seemed
to
take
possession
of
him
then
brutus
appeared
in
the
doorway
my
son
he
said
as
i
followed
him
to
supper
i
must
compliment
you
positively
you
improve
upon
acquaintance
iii
i
had
remembered
him
as
a
man
who
disliked
talk
i
had
often
seen
him
sit
for
hours
on
end
without
a
word
looking
at
nothing
in
particular
with
his
expressionless
serenity
but
on
this
particular
evening
the
day
activities
appeared
to
have
made
his
social
instincts
vividly
assertive
and
to
arouse
him
to
unusual
and
almost
unnatural
animation
as
we
sat
at
a
small
round
table
beside
the
dining
room
fireplace
he
launched
into
a
cheerful
discourse
ignoring
completely
any
displeasure
i
attempted
to
assume
the
great
room
with
its
dingy
wainscot
only
half
lighted
by
the
candles
on
the
table
before
us
was
cluttered
with
a
hundred
odds
and
ends
that
collect
in
a
deserted
house
a
ladder
a
stiff
rusted
bridle
a
coil
of
frayed
rope
a
kettle
a
dozen
sheets
of
the
gazette
empty
bottles
dusty
crockery
and
broken
chairs
he
surveyed
them
all
with
a
bland
uncritical
glance
from
his
manner
he
might
have
been
surrounded
by
brilliant
company
from
his
conversation
he
might
have
been
in
a
pot
house
i
noticed
at
once
what
many
had
been
at
pains
to
mention
to
me
before
that
my
father
was
not
a
temperate
man
nor
did
our
cellar
seem
wholly
bleak
he
pressed
wine
upon
me
and
soon
had
finished
a
bottle
himself
only
to
gesture
brutus
to
uncork
a
second
and
all
the
while
he
regaled
me
with
anecdotes
of
the
gaming
table
and
the
vices
of
a
dozen
seaports
with
hardly
a
pause
he
described
a
lurid
succession
of
drinking
bouts
and
gallant
adventures
he
finished
a
second
bottle
of
wine
and
was
half
way
through
a
third
yet
all
the
while
his
voice
never
lost
its
pleasant
modulation
never
a
flush
or
an
increase
of
animation
came
to
change
him
politely
detached
he
discoursed
of
love
and
murder
gambling
and
chicanery
drawing
on
the
seemingly
exhaustless
background
of
his
own
experience
for
illustration
he
seemed
to
have
known
the
worst
men
from
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
have
shared
in
their
business
and
their
pleasures
he
seemed
to
have
been
in
every
discreditable
undertaking
that
came
beneath
his
notice
in
retrospect
they
pleased
him
all
and
every
one
what
he
saw
when
he
glanced
at
me
appeared
to
please
him
also
at
any
rate
it
gave
him
the
encouragement
that
one
usually
receives
from
an
attentive
listener
brutus
again
a
bottle
it
is
at
the
fourth
bottle
he
explained
that
i
am
at
my
best
it
is
the
fourth
bottle
or
perhaps
the
fifth
that
seems
to
free
me
from
the
restraints
that
old
habits
and
early
education
have
wound
about
me
vino
my
son
but
the
truth
must
be
measured
in
quarts
for
each
individual
some
men
i
know
might
be
drowned
in
wine
and
still
be
hypocrites
so
solidly
are
their
heads
placed
upon
their
shoulders
but
my
demands
are
modest
my
son
just
as
modest
as
i
am
a
modest
sinner
he
called
to
brutus
to
toss
more
wood
upon
the
fire
leaned
back
for
a
while
holding
his
glass
to
the
light
of
the
flames
and
turned
to
me
again
with
his
cool
perfunctory
smile
strange
is
it
not
that
men
through
all
the
ages
have
sought
fools
and
charlatans
to
tell
their
fortunes
when
a
little
wine
is
clearer
than
the
most
mystic
ball
of
crystal
before
the
bottle
the
priests
of
egypt
and
the
delphic
oracle
seem
as
faint
my
son
as
the
echoes
in
a
snail
shell
palmistry
and
astrology
let
us
fling
them
into
the
whirlpool
of
vanity
but
give
a
man
wine
enough
and
any
observer
can
tell
his
possibilities
a
touch
of
it
and
where
are
the
barriers
with
which
he
has
surrounded
himself
another
drop
and
how
futile
are
all
the
deceptions
which
he
is
wont
to
practice
upon
others
in
kitts
once
i
drank
wine
with
a
most
respectable
merchant
a
man
who
carried
the
bible
beside
his
snuff
box
and
referred
to
both
almost
as
frequently
as
he
did
to
the
profit
and
balance
on
his
ledger
and
would
you
believe
it
the
next
time
he
met
me
he
blamed
me
for
the
loss
of
many
thousands
of
pounds
he
even
laid
at
my
door
certain
reprehensible
indiscretions
of
his
wife
though
i
could
have
told
him
that
night
over
the
glasses
that
both
were
inevitable
long
before
either
occurred
but
pray
do
not
look
at
me
so
blankly
my
son
it
was
not
clairvoyance
on
my
part
merely
simple
reasoning
aided
by
very
excellent
and
very
heady
madeira
how
true
it
is
that
there
is
truth
in
wine
and
money
too
if
the
grape
is
used
to
the
proper
advantage
again
some
men
talk
of
fortune
at
cards
good
luck
or
bad
but
as
for
me
i
can
tell
how
the
luck
will
run
by
the
number
of
bottles
that
are
placed
beside
the
table
a
little
judgment
and
the
crudest
reasoning
that
is
all
but
doubtless
mutual
friends
have
already
hinted
to
you
of
my
propensities
at
cards
and
other
things
is
it
not
so
my
son
was
it
the
gentle
inflection
of
the
question
or
his
intent
glance
that
made
me
feel
as
i
had
felt
before
that
day
that
i
was
face
to
face
with
an
alert
antagonist
he
called
on
me
to
speak
and
i
was
loth
to
break
my
silence
if
he
had
only
left
me
to
my
own
bitter
thoughts
but
why
should
i
have
expected
him
to
be
tactful
why
should
i
have
expected
him
to
be
different
from
the
gossip
that
clouded
his
name
your
card
playing
is
still
remembered
sir
i
told
him
i
have
heard
of
it
two
months
back
deliberately
he
pushed
one
of
the
candles
aside
so
that
the
light
should
stand
less
between
us
poured
himself
another
glass
of
wine
and
flicked
the
dust
from
the
bottle
off
his
sleeve
indeed
was
his
comment
your
memory
does
you
credit
even
though
youthful
impressions
are
apt
to
lodge
fast
or
shall
i
say
it
is
only
another
proof
of
the
veracity
of
my
man
of
business
two
months
ago
at
a
certain
little
gathering
someone
whose
name
i
have
yet
to
discover
informed
you
of
certain
bad
habits
i
had
contracted
in
games
of
chance
i
remember
being
interested
at
the
time
that
my
reputation
lasted
so
well
in
my
absence
but
i
beg
you
let
me
confirm
the
report
still
further
am
i
mistaken
in
believing
you
made
some
apt
retort
sir
i
said
in
a
voice
that
sounded
strangely
discordant
i
told
him
he
lied
ha
said
my
father
and
for
a
moment
i
thought
he
was
going
to
commend
my
act
but
instead
his
eyes
moved
to
the
table
brutus
he
continued
is
my
mind
becoming
cloudy
or
is
it
true
the
wine
is
running
low
open
another
bottle
brutus
there
was
a
silence
while
he
raised
his
glass
to
his
lips
and
am
i
right
he
asked
in
recalling
that
you
allowed
yourself
the
liberty
of
punctuating
that
comment
you
have
been
well
informed
sir
i
answered
i
struck
him
in
the
face
he
waved
a
hand
to
me
in
a
pleasant
gesture
of
acknowledgment
and
half
turned
in
his
chair
the
better
to
speak
over
his
shoulder
did
i
hear
aright
brutus
he
inquired
there
faith
for
you
and
loyalty
he
called
the
boy
a
liar
who
called
me
a
cheat
at
cards
ah
those
illusions
of
youth
ah
for
that
sweet
mirage
that
used
to
glitter
in
the
sky
overhead
it
only
the
wine
that
brings
it
back
today
called
him
a
liar
brutus
and
gave
him
the
blow
but
pardon
he
went
on
his
voice
was
still
grave
and
slow
though
his
lips
were
bent
in
a
bitter
little
smile
his
face
had
reddened
and
it
was
the
wine
i
think
that
made
his
eyes
dance
in
the
candle
light
overlook
i
beg
the
rudeness
of
my
interruption
the
exceptional
in
your
narrative
quite
intrigues
me
my
son
doubtless
your
impulsive
action
led
to
the
conventional
result
there
he
sat
amusedly
examining
me
smiling
at
my
rising
temper
my
reply
shaped
itself
almost
without
my
volition
excuse
me
sir
i
retorted
if
i
say
the
result
was
more
natural
than
your
action
upon
a
greater
provocation
had
it
ever
occurred
to
you
my
son
that
perhaps
my
was
greater
also
let
us
call
it
so
at
any
rate
and
go
on
with
our
adventure
as
you
will
sir
i
said
we
all
make
our
mistakes
he
raised
his
eyebrows
in
polite
surprise
and
his
hand
in
a
gesture
of
protest
our
mistakes
was
i
not
right
in
believing
you
had
a
competent
instructor
i
begin
to
fear
your
education
is
deficient
surely
you
have
agility
and
courage
why
a
mistake
my
son
the
mistake
i
replied
was
in
the
beginning
and
not
in
the
end
i
made
the
error
in
believing
he
told
an
untruth
indeed
said
my
father
thank
you
brutus
i
have
had
wine
enough
for
the
evening
do
you
not
consider
your
error
how
shall
we
put
it
quite
inexcusable
in
view
of
the
other
things
you
have
doubtless
heard
but
i
could
only
stare
dumbly
at
him
across
the
table
come
come
he
continued
how
goes
the
gossip
now
surely
there
is
more
about
me
surely
you
have
heard
he
paused
to
drain
the
dregs
in
his
glass
the
rest
i
eyed
him
for
a
moment
in
silence
before
i
answered
but
he
met
my
glance
fairly
indulging
apparently
in
the
same
curiosity
half
idle
half
cynical
that
he
might
have
displayed
before
some
episode
of
the
theatre
it
was
a
useless
question
that
he
asked
he
knew
too
well
that
the
answer
was
obvious
yes
i
said
i
have
heard
it
so
he
exclaimed
cheerfully
my
reputation
still
continues
wonderful
is
it
not
how
durable
a
bad
reputation
is
and
how
fragile
a
good
one
one
bounds
back
like
a
rubber
ball
the
other
shatters
like
a
lustre
punch
bowl
and
did
the
same
young
man
i
presume
he
was
young
enlighten
you
about
this
the
most
fatal
parental
weakness
no
i
said
i
learned
of
it
later
he
raised
his
hand
and
began
gently
stroking
his
coat
lapel
his
fingers
quickly
crossing
it
in
a
vain
search
for
some
imaginary
wrinkle
moving
back
and
forth
with
a
steady
persistence
while
he
watched
me
still
amused
still
indifferent
and
might
i
ask
who
told
you
he
inquired
your
i
replied
my
uncle
jason
dieu
cried
my
father
but
i
grow
careless
he
was
looking
ruefully
at
his
lapel
somehow
the
threads
had
given
way
and
there
was
a
rent
in
the
gray
satin
another
coat
ruined
he
observed
and
the
raillery
was
gone
from
his
voice
how
fortunate
it
is
that
the
evening
is
well
along
and
bed
time
is
nearly
here
one
coat
torn
in
the
brambles
and
one
with
a
knife
and
now
but
your
uncle
was
right
quite
right
in
telling
you
indeed
i
should
have
done
the
same
myself
the
truth
first
my
son
always
remember
that
and
he
turned
again
to
his
coat
i
told
him
i
did
not
believe
it
i
ventured
but
the
appeal
in
my
voice
if
there
was
any
passed
him
quite
unnoticed
indeed
he
said
brutus
you
will
put
an
extra
blanket
on
my
bed
for
i
fancy
the
night
air
is
biting
i
pushed
back
my
chair
and
now
you
will
excuse
me
i
said
if
i
take
my
leave
i
rose
a
trifle
unsteadily
and
stood
before
him
with
no
particular
effort
to
hide
my
anger
and
contempt
but
apparently
i
had
ceased
to
be
of
interest
he
was
sitting
just
as
i
had
first
seen
him
that
morning
staring
into
the
embers
of
the
fire
as
i
watched
him
even
through
my
anger
i
felt
a
vague
regret
a
touch
of
pity
pity
for
a
life
that
was
wasted
in
spite
of
its
possibilities
in
boasting
and
blackguardry
i
began
hoping
that
he
would
speak
would
argue
or
remonstrate
instead
he
said
nothing
only
sat
serenely
indifferent
his
eyes
still
on
the
fire
stepping
around
the
debris
that
filled
the
room
i
had
placed
my
hand
on
the
latch
when
i
heard
a
stealthy
footstep
behind
me
brutus
was
at
my
elbow
there
was
a
tinkle
of
a
wine
glass
falling
on
the
hearth
i
turned
to
see
my
father
facing
me
beside
the
table
i
had
quitted
the
calm
modulation
gone
from
his
voice
his
whole
body
poised
and
alert
as
though
ready
to
spring
through
the
space
that
separated
us
no
doubt
he
said
drawing
a
deep
breath
you
are
leaving
this
house
because
you
can
not
bear
to
stay
under
the
same
roof
with
a
man
of
my
stamp
and
accomplishments
come
is
that
the
reason
only
partly
i
answered
turning
to
face
him
and
then
the
words
tripped
off
my
tongue
hot
and
bitter
before
i
had
wit
to
check
them
what
right
have
i
to
be
particular
now
that
i
have
found
out
my
inheritance
why
should
i
pick
my
company
why
should
i
presume
to
hold
my
head
up
i
can
only
be
blessed
now
sir
like
the
rest
of
the
meek
i
paused
to
let
my
final
words
sink
in
and
because
i
knew
they
would
hurt
him
i
spoke
them
with
an
added
satisfaction
i
shall
start
at
once
to
acquire
merit
which
the
moth
can
not
corrupt
i
continued
i
am
leaving
to
apologize
to
the
man
i
fought
with
because
he
called
you
a
cheat
and
to
my
uncle
for
doubting
his
word
my
father
fist
came
down
on
the
table
with
a
crash
then
by
god
he
shouted
you
not
leave
this
room
you
not
take
a
single
step
until
you
learned
two
things
learned
them
so
never
forget
stand
where
you
are
and
listen
iv
i
remember
the
curious
feeling
i
had
that
my
father
was
gone
that
he
had
vanished
while
my
back
was
turned
leaving
me
to
face
someone
else
then
as
i
stared
at
him
still
unready
and
speechless
the
light
died
out
of
his
eyes
his
lips
relaxed
and
his
hand
went
up
to
arrange
the
lace
at
his
throat
shun
my
example
he
said
shudder
at
the
life
i
have
led
call
me
dissolute
call
me
dangerous
company
say
that
in
every
way
i
unfit
to
be
your
father
say
that
i
an
outcast
suitable
only
as
material
for
slander
i
will
agree
with
you
i
will
teach
you
that
your
judgment
is
correct
let
us
only
set
two
limits
and
do
not
call
them
virtues
they
are
necessities
in
the
life
i
lead
nothing
more
they
the
sound
at
the
knocker
on
the
front
door
broke
into
my
father
speech
and
stilled
it
in
the
pause
while
the
echoes
died
away
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
negligently
and
settled
himself
back
in
his
chair
my
son
he
sighed
allow
me
to
point
out
the
misfortune
of
being
a
man
of
affairs
they
will
never
adjust
themselves
to
the
proper
time
and
place
brutus
the
two
gentlemen
about
whom
i
was
speaking
show
them
in
at
once
and
you
my
son
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
leave
the
evening
is
young
yet
where
are
you
shelton
came
a
sharp
authoritative
voice
from
the
hallway
damn
this
dark
passage
open
the
door
henry
my
father
said
as
i
did
so
two
gentlemen
entered
the
taller
without
bothering
to
remove
his
hat
strode
over
to
my
father
chair
the
other
stood
undecided
near
the
threshold
until
brutus
closed
the
door
behind
him
without
rising
from
his
chair
my
father
gave
first
one
and
then
the
other
the
impartial
casual
glance
of
the
disinterested
observer
this
he
remarked
politely
comes
near
to
being
unexpected
i
had
heard
you
had
come
to
town
but
i
had
hoped
to
meet
you
only
in
some
desolate
waste
of
purgatory
i
fear
your
visitation
finds
me
singularly
unprepared
to
do
the
duties
of
a
host
you
found
the
passage
dark
ah
lawton
i
fear
it
will
be
darker
still
where
you
are
going
that
enough
shelton
interrupted
the
first
gentleman
i
come
here
to
hear
you
talk
i
heard
you
do
that
often
enough
in
the
old
days
you
can
talk
a
woman
off
her
feet
but
by
god
you
ca
talk
me
my
father
waved
his
hand
negligently
as
though
disavowing
some
compliment
the
same
forceful
character
he
observed
gently
the
same
blunt
candor
how
refreshing
it
is
lawton
after
years
of
intrigue
and
dissimulation
my
son
this
is
lawton
an
old
but
he
will
pardon
me
if
i
do
not
add
a
valued
acquaintance
for
a
moment
lawton
pale
eyes
looked
sharply
into
mine
and
i
bowed
to
him
ironically
i
saw
a
high
thin
face
resolute
and
impulsive
a
grim
ascetic
face
with
a
long
straight
nose
that
seemed
pulled
too
close
to
his
upper
lip
and
a
mouth
stamped
roughly
on
a
narrow
bony
jaw
a
mouth
as
i
looked
at
it
that
seemed
ready
to
utter
an
imprecation
lawton
and
i
have
met
before
i
said
indeed
and
our
friend
in
the
background
my
father
continued
perhaps
it
is
my
bad
memory
that
permits
his
identity
still
to
be
a
revelation
the
stranger
nervously
arranged
a
fold
in
his
sea
cloak
while
his
little
black
eyes
darted
restlessly
about
the
room
it
sims
captain
shelton
he
volunteered
in
a
gentle
unassuming
voice
and
very
much
at
your
service
captain
shelton
be
damned
snapped
lawton
keep
your
name
to
yourself
sims
and
watch
the
nigger
and
the
boy
now
shelton
for
the
reason
why
i
here
indeed
i
am
forced
to
admit
the
reason
for
your
visit
may
have
its
pertinence
my
father
admitted
the
fatigues
of
a
long
day
coupled
with
the
evening
wine
he
stifled
a
yawn
behind
the
back
of
his
hand
and
smiled
in
polite
deprecation
slight
as
was
his
speech
lawton
seemed
to
take
a
deep
interest
in
it
indeed
even
while
he
backed
around
the
table
and
seated
himself
in
the
chair
i
had
occupied
my
father
slightest
expression
engaged
his
undivided
attention
there
fell
a
silence
such
as
sometimes
comes
at
a
game
of
cards
when
the
stakes
at
the
table
are
running
higher
than
is
pleasant
brutus
was
watching
sims
with
a
malignant
intensity
sims
watched
brutus
lawton
eyes
as
i
have
said
never
left
my
father
and
my
father
polished
his
nails
on
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
did
i
understand
you
to
say
he
asked
finally
that
you
were
planning
to
relieve
my
mind
of
the
burden
of
speculation
quite
said
lawton
with
a
poor
attempt
at
dryness
i
have
come
here
tonight
to
induce
or
force
you
to
return
a
piece
of
stolen
property
i
give
you
the
liberty
of
taking
your
choice
either
his
voice
raised
itself
to
a
sharp
command
you
shelton
sit
still
the
picture
had
changed
lawton
was
leaning
across
the
table
levelling
a
pistol
at
my
father
head
with
a
detached
academic
interest
my
father
glanced
at
the
weapon
and
without
perceptible
pause
without
added
haste
or
deliberation
he
continued
to
withdraw
the
hand
he
had
thrust
into
his
right
coat
pocket
beside
me
i
heard
brutus
draw
a
sharp
breath
i
saw
sims
fumble
under
his
cloak
and
take
a
quick
step
backwards
there
was
a
tense
pregnant
silence
broken
by
sims
in
fervent
expletive
my
father
had
withdrawn
his
hand
he
was
holding
in
it
his
silver
snuff
box
which
he
tossed
carelessly
on
the
table
where
it
slid
among
the
wine
bottles
why
strain
so
at
a
gnat
lawton
he
continued
in
his
old
conversational
manner
though
one
can
kill
a
sparrow
with
a
five
pound
shot
is
it
worth
the
effort
small
as
my
personal
regard
is
for
you
a
note
penned
in
three
lines
would
have
brought
you
back
your
trinket
but
when
you
say
it
is
stolen
with
a
gesture
of
exasperation
lawton
attempted
to
interrupt
when
you
say
it
is
stolen
my
father
continued
raising
his
voice
your
memory
fails
you
i
won
that
snuff
box
from
you
fairly
because
your
horse
refused
a
water
jump
in
baltimore
fifteen
years
ago
lawton
made
a
grimace
of
impatience
perhaps
i
can
refresh
your
memory
on
a
more
immediate
matter
he
interjected
harshly
a
matter
rather
more
in
keeping
with
your
character
do
do
move
i
beg
of
you
at
a
certain
chateau
in
the
loire
valley
as
recently
as
two
months
ago
you
had
an
unfortunate
escapade
with
french
government
agents
let
us
err
on
the
side
of
accuracy
said
my
father
in
gracious
assent
and
add
that
the
affair
was
rather
more
unfortunate
for
the
agents
than
for
myself
meaning
it
was
fortunate
you
ran
away
i
suppose
suggested
lawton
fortunate
but
natural
you
escaped
shelton
in
the
company
of
a
certain
young
lady
they
were
seeking
to
apprehend
you
retained
in
your
possession
a
list
of
names
of
political
importance
it
is
a
part
of
your
damned
blackmail
i
suppose
i
say
you
stole
that
paper
indeed
said
my
father
in
that
case
permit
me
the
snuff
is
excellent
lawton
although
the
box
is
commonplace
by
god
shouted
lawton
i
had
enough
of
your
damned
simpering
airs
you
a
coward
shelton
why
conceal
it
from
me
a
coward
afraid
to
demand
satisfaction
after
a
public
insult
a
thief
with
your
theft
still
about
you
i
come
to
get
that
list
to
return
it
to
its
rightful
owners
try
your
drunkard
bragging
on
stupefied
boys
but
not
on
me
for
the
last
time
will
you
give
that
letter
up
my
father
hand
that
held
the
snuff
box
trembled
his
glance
was
almost
furtive
as
he
looked
from
sims
back
to
lawton
for
a
moment
he
stared
at
lawton
pistol
then
he
moistened
his
lips
suppose
i
should
refuse
he
asked
with
a
wan
smile
lawton
rubbed
his
left
hand
over
his
long
chin
in
that
case
he
said
i
shall
summon
five
men
whom
i
hold
outside
they
will
search
the
house
having
searched
you
first
if
they
do
not
find
the
letter
i
shall
give
you
one
more
chance
to
produce
it
of
course
you
realize
your
action
is
illegal
my
father
interrupted
lawton
laughed
we
beaten
about
the
bush
long
enough
he
said
will
i
have
to
remind
you
again
that
i
did
come
to
hear
you
talk
come
to
the
point
will
you
give
up
that
paper
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
my
father
fumbled
in
his
breast
pocket
when
he
spoke
it
seemed
a
weak
appeal
to
justify
his
action
under
the
circumstances
what
else
can
i
do
he
demanded
though
it
seems
hard
when
i
had
given
my
word
not
to
part
with
it
he
produced
a
long
sealed
document
which
he
handed
across
the
table
lawton
eyes
glistened
with
anticipation
as
he
took
it
he
held
it
over
the
table
to
scan
the
seal
damn
all
your
caution
sims
he
exclaimed
exultantly
we
got
it
just
as
i
said
we
would
did
i
tell
you
his
voice
choked
he
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
sneezing
my
father
had
thrown
the
contents
of
his
snuff
box
into
lawton
face
if
his
chair
had
been
of
hot
iron
he
could
not
have
moved
more
quickly
almost
the
same
moment
lawton
pistol
was
in
my
father
hand
cocked
and
primed
and
pointed
at
sims
brutus
said
my
father
unburden
sims
of
his
weapons
lawton
a
breath
of
night
air
may
relieve
you
let
us
go
to
the
window
and
reflect
on
the
slip
that
may
occur
between
the
container
and
the
nose
my
son
give
lawton
your
arm
assist
me
to
open
the
shutters
now
lawton
call
to
your
men
tell
them
they
may
go
louder
louder
lawton
surely
your
voice
has
more
strength
my
ears
have
been
weary
this
long
time
with
its
clamor
v
even
today
as
i
pen
these
lines
the
picture
comes
back
with
the
same
intensity
but
little
mellowed
or
softened
with
the
years
the
gaunt
old
room
that
had
entertained
so
many
guests
emptied
of
its
last
one
with
nothing
but
the
faint
chill
that
had
come
through
the
opened
window
to
remind
one
of
their
presence
the
fitful
light
of
the
two
candles
that
had
begun
spluttering
in
the
tall
brass
sticks
brutus
with
quiet
adroitness
clearing
away
the
bottles
and
the
dishes
and
a
sudden
burst
of
flame
from
the
back
log
in
the
fireplace
that
made
his
shadow
jump
unevenly
over
the
opposite
wall
and
my
father
resting
languidly
in
his
chair
again
quite
as
though
nothing
had
happened
i
remember
looking
about
me
and
almost
doubting
that
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
had
passed
in
the
last
five
minutes
i
glanced
narrowly
at
him
but
there
was
nothing
in
his
manner
to
betray
that
he
had
not
been
sitting
there
for
the
past
hour
in
peaceful
meditation
was
he
thinking
of
the
other
nights
when
the
room
was
bright
with
silver
and
candles
my
son
he
remarked
presently
i
was
saying
to
you
before
our
callers
interrupted
that
there
are
just
two
things
i
never
do
do
you
still
care
to
know
them
i
think
that
one
may
be
enough
for
tonight
it
is
that
circumstances
oblige
me
to
keep
my
word
you
do
not
care
to
tell
me
any
more
i
asked
him
only
that
you
had
better
stay
my
son
if
you
do
i
can
guarantee
you
will
see
me
at
my
worst
which
is
better
perhaps
than
hearing
of
me
second
hand
and
possibly
it
may
even
be
interesting
the
little
drama
which
is
starting
thoughtfully
he
balanced
the
pistol
he
was
still
holding
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
half
unconsciously
examined
the
priming
while
i
watched
him
half
with
misgiving
half
with
a
reluctant
sort
of
admiration
when
he
turned
towards
me
again
his
eyes
had
brightened
as
though
he
were
dwelling
on
a
pleasing
reminiscence
indeed
he
mused
it
might
be
more
than
interesting
hilarious
in
fact
if
it
were
not
for
the
lady
in
the
case
the
lady
i
echoed
involuntarily
and
why
not
indeed
he
said
with
a
shrug
let
us
do
our
best
to
be
consistent
what
drama
is
complete
without
a
lady
in
it
it
would
have
been
simpler
i
admit
if
i
had
stolen
the
paper
per
se
and
not
the
lady
with
it
the
lady
i
fear
is
becoming
an
encumbrance
am
i
to
understand
you
brought
a
woman
with
you
across
the
ocean
he
placed
the
pistol
on
the
table
before
him
looked
at
it
critically
and
changed
its
position
a
lady
my
son
not
a
woman
you
will
find
that
the
two
are
quite
different
species
i
fear
she
had
but
little
choice
that
is
a
pretty
lock
on
lawton
weapon
you
mean
she
is
here
now
i
persisted
he
must
surely
have
been
in
jest
to
be
sure
he
acquiesced
she
is
i
trust
asleep
in
the
east
guest
room
and
heaven
help
you
if
you
wake
her
but
why
do
you
start
my
son
does
it
seem
odd
to
you
that
i
should
act
as
squire
not
in
the
least
i
assured
him
i
am
only
astonished
that
she
should
consent
to
accompany
you
you
say
sir
that
she
is
a
lady
at
least
he
replied
i
am
broadening
your
education
that
in
itself
henry
quite
repays
me
for
any
trouble
i
may
have
taken
but
i
fear
you
are
putting
a
bad
construction
on
it
i
beg
of
you
do
not
judge
me
so
harshly
launcelot
himself
what
am
i
saying
bayard
himself
up
to
the
present
moment
could
only
commend
my
every
action
even
to
bringing
her
to
this
house
i
suggested
coldly
precisely
he
replied
that
in
itself
was
actuated
by
the
highest
piece
of
altruism
heaven
has
vouchsafed
humanity
the
regard
a
father
has
for
his
son
do
you
mean
to
think
i
demanded
angrily
that
you
can
bring
me
into
this
business
i
was
still
on
my
feet
and
took
a
quick
step
toward
him
is
it
not
enough
to
find
you
what
you
are
you
done
enough
to
me
tonight
sir
without
adding
an
insult
my
father
nodded
quite
as
though
he
were
receiving
a
compliment
seemingly
still
well
pleased
he
helped
himself
again
to
his
snuff
and
dusted
his
fingers
carefully
with
his
lace
handkerchief
you
misunderstand
me
he
said
gently
my
present
occupation
requires
a
shrewder
head
and
a
steadier
hand
than
yours
and
a
different
code
of
morals
i
added
bowing
positively
my
son
you
are
turning
puritan
he
remarked
a
most
refreshing
change
for
the
family
i
had
an
angry
retort
at
the
tip
of
my
tongue
but
it
remained
unspoken
for
the
second
time
that
evening
the
dining
room
door
opened
i
swung
away
from
the
table
my
father
leapt
to
his
feet
bland
and
obsequious
a
girl
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
was
standing
on
the
threshold
staring
at
us
curiously
holding
a
candle
that
softened
the
austerity
of
her
plain
black
dress
there
in
the
half
light
there
was
a
slender
grace
about
her
that
made
her
seem
vaguely
unreal
in
that
disordered
room
she
seemed
as
incongruous
as
some
portrait
from
a
house
across
the
water
as
coldly
unresponsive
to
her
surroundings
i
imagined
her
on
the
last
canvas
of
the
gallery
bearing
all
the
traits
of
the
family
line
the
same
quiet
assurance
the
same
confident
tilt
of
the
head
the
same
high
forehead
and
clear
cut
features
evidently
a
similar
thought
was
running
through
my
father
mind
ah
mademoiselle
he
said
swiftly
in
the
french
tongue
stay
where
you
are
stay
but
a
moment
for
as
you
stand
there
in
the
shadows
you
epitomize
the
whole
house
of
blanzy
their
grace
their
pride
their
beauty
she
tried
to
suppress
a
smile
but
only
half
succeeded
i
fear
the
captain
has
been
drinking
again
she
said
quietly
not
that
i
am
sorry
the
wine
improves
you
i
think
mademoiselle
lures
me
to
a
drunkard
grave
exclaimed
my
father
bowing
low
but
pray
be
seated
a
chair
for
the
lady
my
son
early
this
afternoon
they
told
me
not
to
expect
you
i
trust
you
have
had
everything
possible
done
for
your
comfort
for
a
moment
she
favored
me
with
an
incurious
glance
i
was
unable
to
see
you
on
the
ship
captain
and
i
wanted
to
have
a
word
with
you
at
the
first
opportunity
otherwise
i
would
not
have
favored
you
with
a
tableau
of
the
house
of
blanzy
i
wanted
to
speak
with
you
alone
she
had
declined
the
chair
i
offered
her
and
was
standing
facing
him
her
eyes
almost
on
a
level
with
his
this
said
my
father
bowing
again
is
delightfully
unexpected
but
i
forget
myself
this
is
my
son
henry
shelton
may
i
present
him
to
mlle
de
blanzy
i
suppose
you
may
as
well
she
replied
holding
a
hand
toward
me
indifferently
let
us
trust
he
has
your
good
qualities
monsieur
and
none
of
your
bad
ones
but
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
alone
my
son
is
discretion
itself
said
my
father
with
another
bow
pray
let
him
stay
i
feel
sure
our
discussion
will
not
only
interest
but
instruct
him
mademoiselle
frowned
and
tapped
an
angry
foot
on
the
floor
you
heard
what
i
said
sir
send
him
out
she
demanded
stay
where
you
are
henry
said
my
father
gently
stay
where
you
are
he
repeated
more
loudly
as
i
started
for
the
door
i
have
something
further
to
say
to
you
before
you
leave
this
house
your
pardon
he
explained
turning
again
to
mademoiselle
but
my
son
and
i
have
had
a
slight
falling
out
over
a
question
of
ethics
which
i
think
directly
concerns
the
matter
you
wish
to
discuss
pray
forgive
me
mademoiselle
but
i
had
much
rather
he
remained
mademoiselle
glanced
at
me
again
this
time
with
an
appeal
in
her
eyes
which
i
read
and
understood
it
seemed
to
me
a
trace
more
of
color
had
mounted
to
her
cheeks
she
seemed
about
to
speak
but
paused
irresolutely
i
made
a
bow
which
i
did
my
best
to
render
the
equal
of
my
father
and
for
the
first
time
i
was
glad
i
had
entered
his
house
mademoiselle
i
said
it
is
a
pleasure
to
render
you
even
so
small
a
service
and
i
turned
to
my
father
and
met
his
glance
squarely
i
can
not
see
any
profit
to
either
of
us
for
me
to
remain
longer
i
observed
either
here
or
in
this
house
and
i
turned
to
the
door
brutus
called
my
father
sharply
stand
by
the
door
now
sir
if
you
leave
this
room
before
i
am
ready
my
servant
shall
retain
you
by
force
mademoiselle
will
pardon
this
domestic
scene
he
added
the
boy
has
an
uncertain
temper
i
looked
to
see
brutus
great
bulk
grinning
at
me
from
the
doorway
i
saw
my
father
half
smiling
and
fingering
the
lace
at
his
throat
i
saw
mademoiselle
watching
me
partly
frightened
but
partly
curious
as
though
she
had
witnessed
similar
occurrences
then
my
pent
up
anger
got
the
better
of
me
lawton
pistol
still
lay
on
the
table
before
my
father
could
divine
my
intention
i
had
seized
it
and
held
it
pointed
at
brutus
head
sir
i
said
breathing
a
trifle
faster
than
usual
i
am
not
used
to
being
threatened
by
servants
order
him
to
one
side
my
father
looked
at
me
almost
admiringly
and
his
hand
that
had
been
fingering
the
lace
groped
toward
an
empty
bottle
anything
but
a
bottle
father
i
said
watching
him
from
the
tail
of
my
eye
anything
but
a
bottle
it
smacks
of
such
low
associations
your
pardon
henry
he
said
quickly
the
movement
was
purely
unconscious
i
had
thought
we
were
through
with
pistols
for
the
evening
and
mademoiselle
must
be
fatigued
so
put
down
the
pistol
henry
and
let
us
continue
the
interview
certainly
i
replied
as
soon
as
you
have
fulfilled
your
part
of
the
contract
as
soon
as
you
call
off
your
servant
i
shall
wish
you
a
very
good
evening
stand
where
you
are
brutus
come
come
said
my
father
patiently
we
have
had
enough
of
the
grotesque
this
evening
it
is
growing
late
my
son
put
down
the
pistol
brutus
i
called
if
you
move
again
backwards
or
forwards
fire
and
i
backed
towards
the
wall
good
said
my
father
henry
you
have
an
amount
of
courage
and
foresight
which
i
scarcely
expected
even
in
a
son
of
mine
yet
not
enough
foresight
to
see
that
it
is
useless
put
down
the
pistol
put
it
down
before
i
take
it
from
you
his
hand
had
returned
again
to
his
torn
lapel
and
he
was
leaning
slightly
forward
one
instant
father
i
said
quickly
if
you
come
a
step
nearer
i
shall
fire
on
your
servant
pray
believe
i
am
serious
father
my
son
he
cried
in
mock
alarm
you
distress
me
never
be
serious
life
has
too
many
disappointments
for
that
have
you
not
read
marcus
aurelius
have
you
reloaded
your
snuff
box
i
asked
him
not
that
he
said
shaking
his
head
but
i
know
a
hundred
ways
to
disarm
a
man
otherwise
i
should
not
be
here
witnessing
this
original
situation
my
son
i
could
have
killed
you
half
a
dozen
times
since
you
have
been
holding
that
weapon
admitted
i
answered
but
i
hardly
think
you
will
go
to
such
lengths
we
all
must
pause
somewhere
father
no
he
agreed
unfortunately
i
am
of
a
mild
disposition
and
yet
he
made
a
sudden
move
toward
me
do
you
realize
your
weapon
is
unprimed
shall
i
try
it
i
asked
excellent
said
my
father
you
impress
me
yes
i
have
underrated
your
possibilities
henry
however
the
play
is
over
he
leaned
towards
the
table
abruptly
and
extinguished
both
the
candles
the
glow
of
embers
in
the
fireplace
could
not
relieve
the
darkness
of
the
shuttered
room
now
he
continued
mademoiselle
is
standing
beside
me
and
brutus
is
between
you
and
me
and
approaching
you
i
think
it
would
be
safer
if
you
put
the
pistol
down
one
aim
is
uncertain
in
the
dark
and
after
all
it
is
not
mademoiselle
quarrel
tell
him
to
put
down
the
pistol
mademoiselle
her
voice
answered
from
the
darkness
in
front
of
me
on
the
contrary
she
said
lightly
pray
continue
i
have
not
the
heart
to
stop
it
nor
the
courage
to
interfere
in
a
family
quarrel
quite
as
one
would
expect
from
mademoiselle
his
voice
replied
but
fortunately
my
son
also
has
not
forgotten
his
manners
henry
have
you
set
down
the
pistol
i
tossed
it
on
the
floor
unfortunately
i
said
i
have
no
woman
to
hide
behind
i
hoped
the
thrust
went
home
but
my
father
voice
answered
without
a
tremor
you
are
right
my
son
a
woman
is
often
useful
though
generally
when
you
least
expect
it
the
candles
brutus
vi
he
rubbed
his
fingernails
on
his
sleeve
and
glanced
about
him
with
a
pleasure
he
seemed
quite
unable
to
conceal
mademoiselle
cold
stare
seemed
to
react
upon
him
like
a
smile
of
gratitude
the
contempt
on
my
face
he
seemed
to
read
in
terms
of
adulation
brutus
pick
up
the
pistol
my
son
you
are
more
amusing
than
i
had
hoped
indeed
mademoiselle
perhaps
the
old
saying
is
right
that
the
best
is
in
our
i
have
had
perhaps
an
exceptional
opportunity
to
see
the
world
i
have
spent
a
longer
time
than
i
like
to
think
collecting
material
for
enlivening
reminiscence
but
i
can
not
recall
having
been
present
before
at
a
scene
with
so
many
elements
of
interest
you
harbor
no
ill
feelings
my
son
none
that
are
new
i
said
only
my
first
impressions
and
they
are
he
paused
modestly
he
might
have
been
awaiting
a
tribute
father
i
remonstrated
there
is
a
lady
present
you
had
almost
made
me
forget
he
sighed
regretfully
you
wished
to
have
a
word
with
me
mademoiselle
i
am
listening
no
no
my
son
you
will
be
interested
i
am
sure
the
door
brutus
but
it
was
not
brutus
who
stopped
me
mademoiselle
had
laid
a
hand
on
my
arm
as
i
looked
down
at
her
the
bitterness
and
chagrin
i
had
felt
began
slowly
to
ebb
away
her
eyes
met
mine
for
a
moment
in
thoughtful
appraisal
you
have
been
kind
she
said
softly
kind
and
you
know
you
have
no
reason
she
might
have
continued
but
my
father
interrupted
no
reason
he
said
no
reason
it
is
only
mademoiselle
complete
disregard
of
self
that
prevents
her
from
seeing
the
reason
a
reason
he
added
bowing
which
seems
to
me
as
natural
as
it
is
obvious
i
turned
toward
him
quickly
from
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
could
see
brutus
move
nearer
and
then
mademoiselle
stepped
between
us
we
have
had
quite
enough
of
this
said
mademoiselle
and
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
a
condescension
that
was
not
wholly
displeasing
then
fixing
her
eyes
on
my
father
she
continued
not
that
i
am
in
the
least
afraid
of
you
captain
shelton
we
have
had
to
employ
too
many
men
like
you
not
to
know
your
type
your
son
i
think
must
take
after
his
mother
i
fear
he
thinks
i
am
a
damsel
in
distress
i
trust
captain
that
you
know
better
though
for
the
moment
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
forgotten
my
father
echoed
raising
his
eyebrows
yes
she
said
speaking
more
quickly
forgotten
that
you
are
in
the
pay
of
my
family
you
had
contracted
to
get
certain
papers
from
france
which
were
in
danger
of
being
seized
by
the
authorities
seemingly
undecided
how
to
go
on
she
hesitated
glanced
at
me
covertly
and
then
continued
i
accompanied
you
because
because
you
did
not
care
to
share
the
fate
reserved
for
the
papers
my
father
suggested
politely
for
a
moment
she
was
silent
staring
at
my
father
almost
incredulously
while
he
inclined
his
head
solicitously
as
though
ready
to
obey
her
smallest
wish
again
i
started
to
turn
away
the
door
brutus
said
my
father
i
am
beginning
to
see
i
made
a
mistake
in
not
remaining
mademoiselle
said
finally
yet
you
contrived
to
rescue
both
the
papers
and
mademoiselle
if
i
remember
rightly
said
my
father
bowing
an
interesting
and
original
undertaking
but
pray
do
not
thank
me
be
still
she
commanded
sharply
you
were
not
paid
to
be
impertinent
captain
i
have
only
one
more
request
to
make
of
you
before
i
leave
this
house
tomorrow
morning
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
glanced
at
me
as
though
definitely
to
assure
himself
that
i
was
listening
i
do
not
think
that
mademoiselle
will
leave
the
house
at
that
date
he
said
with
a
second
bow
and
what
does
the
captain
mean
by
that
she
asked
quickly
simply
that
the
house
is
already
watched
said
my
father
watched
mademoiselle
by
persons
in
the
pay
of
the
french
government
do
not
start
mademoiselle
they
will
not
trouble
us
tonight
i
think
for
the
first
time
her
surprising
left
her
she
turned
pale
even
to
her
red
lips
stretched
out
a
hand
blindly
and
grasped
the
table
and
the
paper
she
whispered
you
have
destroyed
it
my
father
shook
his
head
then
gasped
mademoiselle
give
it
to
me
now
at
once
captain
if
you
please
mademoiselle
no
longer
trusts
me
asked
my
father
in
tones
of
pained
surprise
surely
not
that
exactly
that
she
flung
back
at
him
angrily
he
bowed
smilingly
in
acknowledgment
and
mademoiselle
is
right
he
agreed
i
have
read
the
paper
i
have
been
tempted
you
rogue
she
cried
you
mean
i
mean
he
interrupted
calmly
that
i
have
been
tempted
and
have
fallen
the
document
i
carry
has
too
much
value
mademoiselle
the
actual
signatures
of
the
gentlemen
who
had
been
so
deluded
as
to
believe
they
could
restore
a
king
to
france
figure
for
yourself
my
lady
those
names
properly
used
are
a
veritable
gold
mine
more
profitable
than
my
chinese
trade
can
hope
to
be
surely
you
realize
that
so
you
have
turned
from
cards
to
diplomacy
i
observed
how
versatile
you
grow
father
they
are
much
the
same
thing
my
father
said
and
you
mean
mademoiselle
cried
you
are
dog
enough
to
use
those
names
you
mean
you
are
going
back
on
your
word
either
to
destroy
that
list
or
to
place
it
in
proper
hands
you
mean
you
are
willing
to
see
your
friends
go
under
the
guillotine
surely
not
monsieur
surely
you
are
too
brave
a
gentleman
surely
a
man
who
has
behaved
as
gallantly
as
you
no
captain
i
can
not
believe
it
mademoiselle
he
said
blandly
still
has
much
to
learn
of
the
world
take
myself
for
instance
i
am
a
gentleman
only
by
birth
and
breeding
otherwise
pray
believe
i
am
quite
unspeakable
quite
do
you
not
see
that
even
my
son
finds
me
so
he
nodded
towards
me
in
graceful
courtesy
for
me
he
continued
smoothly
only
one
thing
has
ever
remained
evident
and
for
long
and
that
my
lady
is
money
nearly
everything
else
seems
to
tarnish
but
still
money
keeps
its
lustre
ah
now
we
begin
to
understand
each
other
strange
you
should
not
realize
it
sooner
i
can
not
understand
what
actuated
so
many
persons
supposedly
rational
to
sign
such
a
ridiculous
document
that
they
have
done
so
is
their
fault
not
mine
i
believe
mademoiselle
in
profiting
by
the
mistakes
of
others
i
believe
in
profiting
by
this
one
someone
should
be
glad
to
pay
a
pretty
price
for
it
he
stopped
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
she
stood
before
him
helpless
her
hand
raised
toward
him
in
entreaty
for
a
moment
my
father
glanced
away
you
could
oh
you
could
she
began
for
god
sake
monsieur
think
what
you
are
doing
i
we
all
trusted
you
depended
on
your
help
we
thought
you
were
with
us
we
her
voice
choked
in
a
sob
and
she
sank
into
a
chair
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
my
father
looked
at
her
and
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
indeed
he
said
i
am
almost
sorry
but
it
is
the
game
mademoiselle
we
each
have
our
little
square
on
the
chess
board
i
regret
that
mine
is
a
black
one
a
while
ago
i
was
a
pawn
paid
by
your
family
then
it
seemed
to
me
expedient
to
do
as
you
dictated
to
take
you
out
of
france
to
safety
to
deliver
both
you
and
a
certain
paper
to
your
care
but
that
was
a
while
ago
i
am
approaching
the
king
row
now
forgive
me
if
things
seem
different
and
rest
assured
mademoiselle
that
you
at
least
are
in
safe
hands
as
long
as
you
obey
my
directions
he
made
this
last
statement
with
a
benign
complacency
and
once
more
busied
himself
with
his
nails
i
took
a
step
toward
him
and
he
looked
up
as
though
to
receive
my
congratulations
so
you
leave
us
my
son
he
said
briskly
i
fear
you
will
meet
with
trouble
before
you
pass
the
lane
but
you
seem
surprisingly
able
to
look
out
for
yourself
brutus
will
help
you
to
saddle
you
are
mistaken
i
said
i
am
not
leaving
and
i
bowed
to
mademoiselle
who
had
started
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
and
was
staring
at
me
with
a
face
i
have
decided
to
stay
i
cried
if
mademoiselle
will
permit
me
but
she
did
not
answer
and
my
father
regarded
us
carefully
as
though
balancing
possibilities
not
leaving
whether
my
statement
was
surprising
or
otherwise
was
impossible
to
discern
he
raised
his
eyebrows
in
interrogation
and
i
smiled
at
him
in
a
manner
i
hoped
resembled
his
i
fear
you
may
tire
of
my
company
i
went
on
because
i
am
going
to
stay
until
you
have
disposed
of
this
paper
as
mademoiselle
desires
or
if
you
are
unwilling
to
do
so
i
shall
take
pleasure
in
doing
it
myself
my
father
rubbed
his
hands
and
then
tapped
me
playfully
on
the
shoulder
somehow
i
thought
this
little
scene
would
fetch
you
he
cried
excellent
my
son
i
hoped
you
might
stay
on
and
now
sir
i
said
the
paper
if
you
please
what
exclaimed
my
father
with
a
gesture
of
astonishment
you
too
want
the
paper
how
popular
it
is
becoming
to
be
sure
at
least
i
am
going
to
try
to
get
it
i
began
gravely
when
a
sudden
change
in
his
expression
stopped
me
wait
he
said
coldly
look
before
you
leap
my
son
allow
me
to
make
the
situation
perfectly
clear
before
you
attempt
anything
so
foolish
in
the
first
place
let
us
take
myself
i
am
older
than
you
it
is
true
but
years
and
excitement
have
not
entirely
weakened
me
i
have
been
present
in
many
little
unpleasantnesses
i
have
fought
with
barbary
pirates
and
chinese
junks
and
with
assorted
christians
the
fact
that
i
am
here
tonight
proves
i
am
usually
successful
even
if
i
were
alone
i
doubt
if
you
could
take
the
paper
from
me
but
you
forget
another
matter
he
turned
and
pointed
to
brutus
in
the
doorway
brutus
grinned
back
and
nodded
violently
his
eyes
rolling
in
pleased
anticipation
eight
years
ago
my
father
continued
i
saved
brutus
from
the
gallows
at
jamaica
he
has
a
strangely
persistent
sense
of
gratitude
i
have
seen
brutus
only
last
month
kill
three
stronger
men
than
you
my
son
i
fancy
the
document
is
safe
in
my
pocket
quite
safe
he
half
smiled
and
took
another
pinch
of
snuff
but
let
us
indulge
in
the
impossible
he
continued
suppose
you
did
get
the
paper
let
us
examine
the
paper
itself
and
slowly
he
drew
it
from
his
pocket
and
flicked
it
flat
in
the
candle
light
come
henry
draw
up
a
chair
and
let
us
be
sensible
another
bottle
of
madeira
brutus
and
now
tell
me
what
do
you
know
of
french
politics
sir
i
objected
it
seems
to
me
you
are
forgetting
the
point
what
have
politics
to
do
with
you
and
me
it
seemed
to
me
i
saw
another
opportunity
with
a
sense
of
elation
i
did
my
best
to
conceal
i
watched
him
quickly
drain
his
glass
and
i
thought
his
eyes
were
brighter
and
his
gestures
less
careful
and
alert
politics
he
said
and
politics
alone
henry
are
responsible
for
this
evening
entertainment
surely
you
have
perceived
that
much
the
glasses
brutus
watch
the
glasses
these
are
parlous
times
my
son
he
raised
his
glass
again
mademoiselle
will
tell
you
as
much
we
made
an
interesting
journey
through
the
provinces
did
we
not
my
lady
it
is
a
pity
your
father
the
marquis
could
not
have
enjoyed
it
with
us
he
had
a
penchant
for
interesting
situations
and
in
france
today
anything
may
happen
in
a
few
scant
months
dukes
have
turned
into
pastry
cooks
and
barbers
boys
into
generals
tomorrow
it
may
be
a
republic
or
a
monarchy
that
governs
or
some
bizarre
contrivance
that
is
neither
one
nor
the
other
just
now
it
is
napoleon
bonaparte
a
very
determined
little
man
ah
you
have
heard
of
him
my
son
i
sometimes
wonder
if
he
will
not
go
further
than
many
of
us
think
yes
we
had
already
begun
to
hear
his
name
in
america
we
had
already
begun
to
wonder
how
soon
his
influence
would
be
overthrown
for
it
was
in
the
days
before
he
had
consolidated
his
power
he
was
still
existing
in
a
maze
of
plots
still
facing
royalists
and
revolutionists
all
conspiring
to
seize
the
reins
i
sometimes
wonder
mademoiselle
he
continued
thoughtfully
if
your
friends
realized
the
task
before
them
when
they
attempted
to
kill
napoleon
ah
now
you
grow
interested
my
son
yes
that
is
what
this
paper
signifies
written
on
this
paper
are
the
signatures
of
fifty
men
signatures
to
an
oath
to
kill
napoleon
bonaparte
and
to
restore
a
king
to
france
you
will
agree
with
me
it
is
a
most
original
and
intriguing
document
so
they
did
kill
him
i
said
indeed
not
he
replied
quite
the
contrary
they
gave
him
a
new
lease
of
life
then
why
i
demanded
did
they
burn
the
paper
why
ah
said
my
father
with
an
indulgent
smile
there
you
have
it
to
be
sure
you
have
hit
the
root
of
the
whole
matter
it
was
the
old
marquis
idea
he
told
me
of
it
at
the
time
if
everyone
in
the
plot
signed
the
oath
it
would
be
a
dangerous
thing
indeed
for
anyone
to
inform
on
the
rest
because
they
would
immediately
produce
the
paper
which
showed
him
as
guilty
as
they
there
are
commendable
points
in
the
marquis
idea
my
son
now
that
the
plot
has
failed
the
existence
of
this
paper
is
all
that
keeps
many
a
man
from
telling
a
valuable
and
dangerous
little
story
in
these
signatures
i
read
names
of
men
above
suspicion
men
high
in
the
present
government
somehow
napoleon
police
have
learned
of
the
existence
of
this
paper
it
has
become
almost
vital
for
napoleon
to
obtain
it
he
has
tried
to
get
it
already
since
it
reposed
in
the
strong
box
at
the
chateau
of
blanzy
it
has
cost
him
five
men
it
has
cost
me
new
halliards
and
rigging
for
the
eclipse
and
brutus
a
disfigured
countenance
not
that
i
am
complaining
someone
shall
pay
me
for
it
and
the
game
is
just
beginning
my
son
lawton
have
you
wondered
who
he
is
he
is
a
very
reckless
man
in
the
pay
of
france
he
will
get
that
paper
if
he
can
if
not
by
force
by
money
even
now
his
men
are
watching
the
house
suppose
you
held
the
paper
in
your
hands
my
son
you
still
have
mr
lawton
he
folded
the
paper
and
replaced
it
in
his
pocket
it
is
safer
here
at
present
said
my
father
there
will
be
others
who
will
want
it
presently
and
then
perhaps
we
will
dispose
of
it
in
other
words
you
intend
to
sell
the
people
who
entrusted
you
with
the
paper
to
the
highest
bidder
i
inquired
he
glanced
towards
mademoiselle
and
back
to
me
again
and
smiled
brightly
that
he
admitted
pleasantly
is
one
way
of
looking
at
it
though
it
might
be
viewed
from
more
congenial
angles
i
started
to
speak
but
he
raised
his
voice
and
for
the
second
time
that
evening
became
entirely
serious
the
paper
he
said
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
being
in
this
house
tonight
you
are
becoming
more
of
a
hindrance
than
i
expected
but
you
are
here
and
here
you
will
stay
for
another
reason
i
have
heard
much
of
the
good
examples
parents
set
their
children
for
me
to
set
one
is
a
patent
impossibility
i
have
never
been
a
good
example
but
perhaps
i
can
offer
you
something
which
is
even
better
and
that
my
son
is
why
i
asked
you
to
this
house
can
you
guess
what
it
is
there
is
no
need
to
guess
i
said
you
have
been
perfectly
clear
gossip
had
it
that
my
father
always
loved
the
theatre
though
perhaps
the
green
room
better
than
the
footlights
the
marked
passages
in
his
library
still
attest
his
propensity
he
now
looked
about
him
with
a
keen
appreciation
as
though
my
words
were
all
that
he
required
to
round
out
his
evening
like
a
man
whose
work
is
finished
and
who
is
pleasantly
fatigued
by
his
exertions
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
my
son
he
said
you
have
a
keenness
of
wit
and
a
certain
decision
which
i
confess
i
overlooked
in
you
at
first
the
moment
must
have
pleased
him
for
he
paused
as
though
on
purpose
to
prolong
it
you
are
right
he
continued
finally
i
am
here
to
set
you
a
bad
example
henry
and
believe
me
it
will
be
no
fault
of
mine
if
it
is
not
more
effective
than
a
good
one
listen
my
son
and
you
too
mademoiselle
i
have
been
many
things
tried
many
things
in
this
life
most
of
them
discreditable
i
have
wasted
my
days
and
my
prospects
in
a
thousand
futilities
i
have
lost
my
friends
i
have
lost
my
position
sneer
at
me
my
son
laugh
at
me
curse
me
if
you
wish
i
shall
be
the
first
to
commend
you
for
it
i
am
enough
to
recognize
your
position
but
above
all
things
watch
me
watch
me
and
remember
the
things
i
do
recall
my
ethics
and
my
logic
they
are
to
be
your
legacy
my
son
what
money
i
may
leave
you
is
doubtless
tainted
but
the
things
i
do
of
course
you
perceive
their
value
only
in
a
negative
sense
i
replied
pushing
the
bottle
toward
him
you
are
right
again
he
said
refilling
his
glass
their
value
as
you
say
is
purely
negative
yet
believe
me
it
does
not
impair
them
you
have
only
to
place
them
before
you
and
do
exactly
opposite
it
is
the
best
way
i
can
think
of
for
you
to
become
a
decent
and
man
and
now
you
have
the
only
reason
why
i
permit
you
in
my
society
the
lesson
has
already
started
an
original
lesson
is
it
not
as
though
to
close
the
interview
he
sprang
up
lightly
and
bowed
to
mademoiselle
it
seemed
to
me
he
was
combating
a
slight
embarrassment
for
he
paused
seemingly
uncertain
how
to
begin
but
only
for
a
moment
mademoiselle
had
regained
her
and
was
regarding
him
with
attention
and
a
little
of
the
contempt
which
became
her
so
well
mademoiselle
he
said
even
the
pain
of
distressing
you
is
lessened
by
the
unexpected
pleasure
of
your
company
tonight
i
hope
you
have
found
the
hour
not
entirely
unprofitable
it
has
sometimes
seemed
to
me
my
lady
pardon
the
rudeness
of
suggesting
it
that
you
may
have
seen
something
romantic
something
heroic
in
me
from
time
to
time
i
trust
you
have
been
disillusioned
tonight
the
fight
on
the
stairs
the
open
boat
you
see
them
all
as
they
should
be
do
you
not
the
necessary
parts
of
a
piece
of
villainy
pray
forget
them
and
good
night
mademoiselle
suddenly
both
he
and
i
started
and
involuntarily
his
hand
went
up
to
cover
his
torn
lapel
mademoiselle
was
laughing
captain
she
cried
you
are
absurd
absurd
exclaimed
my
father
uncertainly
you
of
all
people
you
can
not
sell
the
paper
he
sighed
with
apparent
relief
and
why
not
he
asked
because
said
mademoiselle
you
are
one
of
those
who
signed
it
mademoiselle
forgets
said
my
father
bowing
that
her
name
and
mine
were
written
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
it
is
a
precaution
i
always
take
with
such
little
matters
the
first
thing
i
did
mademoiselle
was
to
cut
both
off
with
my
razor
brutus
light
the
stairs
for
the
lady
without
another
glance
at
either
of
us
she
walked
slowly
away
her
chin
tilted
her
slender
fingers
clenched
i
knew
that
anger
fear
and
disappointment
were
walking
there
beside
her
and
yet
she
left
the
room
as
proudly
as
she
had
entered
it
i
stood
listening
to
her
step
on
the
stairs
ah
said
my
father
there
is
a
woman
for
you
the
last
few
minutes
seemed
to
have
wearied
him
for
he
sank
back
heavily
in
his
chair
for
a
minute
we
were
silent
and
suddenly
a
speech
of
his
ran
through
my
memory
may
i
ask
you
a
question
i
inquired
it
is
my
regret
if
i
have
not
been
clear
he
said
it
is
not
that
i
assured
him
but
you
have
appeared
to
allow
yourself
a
single
virtue
he
raised
his
eyebrows
you
have
admitted
i
persisted
that
circumstances
force
you
to
keep
your
word
that
my
father
said
is
merely
a
necessity
not
a
virtue
possibly
i
agreed
yet
in
your
conversation
with
lawton
you
stated
that
you
had
given
your
word
not
to
surrender
this
paper
my
question
is
how
can
you
reconcile
this
with
your
present
intentions
for
almost
the
only
time
i
can
remember
my
father
seemed
puzzled
for
an
answer
he
started
to
speak
and
shook
his
head
drew
out
his
handkerchief
and
passed
it
over
his
lips
circumstances
alter
even
principles
he
answered
finally
and
this
my
son
is
one
of
the
circumstances
brutus
the
boy
has
been
trying
to
get
me
drunk
long
enough
show
him
to
his
bedroom
and
bring
me
my
cloak
and
pistols
brutus
lifted
one
of
the
candlesticks
grinned
at
me
and
nodded
a
very
good
night
to
you
henry
said
my
father
tranquilly
i
bowed
to
him
with
courtesy
which
perhaps
was
intuitive
be
sure
i
told
him
to
keep
your
door
locked
father
pray
do
not
worry
he
replied
i
have
thought
out
each
phase
of
my
visit
here
too
long
for
anything
untoward
to
happen
until
morning
henry
i
am
not
worrying
i
rejoined
merely
warning
you
pardon
my
incivility
father
but
i
might
grow
tired
watching
you
be
a
bad
example
did
you
consider
that
in
your
plans
my
father
yawned
and
placed
his
feet
nearer
the
coals
that
is
better
he
said
much
better
my
son
now
you
are
speaking
like
a
gentleman
i
had
begun
to
fear
for
you
it
has
seemed
to
me
you
were
almost
never
be
that
nothing
is
more
annoying
i
drew
myself
up
to
my
full
height
sir
i
began
he
slapped
his
hand
on
the
table
with
an
exclamation
of
disgust
and
now
you
spoil
it
now
you
begin
to
rant
and
become
heroic
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
you
can
not
see
a
woman
bullied
what
well
by
heaven
you
can
and
you
will
see
it
you
can
not
stand
an
act
of
treachery
come
come
my
son
you
have
better
blood
in
you
than
to
pose
as
a
low
actor
all
around
us
every
day
these
things
are
happening
meet
them
like
a
man
and
do
not
tell
me
what
is
obvious
i
felt
my
nails
bite
into
my
palms
your
pardon
father
i
said
i
shall
behave
better
in
the
future
he
glanced
at
me
narrowly
for
a
moment
i
believe
he
said
we
begin
to
understand
a
very
good
night
to
you
henry
and
henry
a
change
in
his
tone
made
me
spin
about
on
my
heel
i
am
going
to
pay
you
a
compliment
pray
do
not
be
overcome
i
have
decided
to
consider
you
in
my
plans
my
son
as
a
possible
disturbing
factor
brutus
you
will
take
his
pistols
from
his
saddle
bags
in
silence
brutus
conducted
me
into
the
cold
hall
and
up
the
winding
staircase
where
his
candle
made
the
shadows
of
the
newel
posts
dance
against
the
wainscot
i
paused
a
moment
at
the
landing
to
look
back
but
i
could
see
nothing
in
the
dark
pit
of
the
hall
below
us
was
it
possible
i
could
remember
it
alight
with
candles
whose
flames
made
soft
halos
on
the
polished
floor
brutus
touched
my
shoulder
and
the
brusque
grasp
of
his
hand
turned
me
a
trifle
cold
move
on
i
ordered
sharply
and
light
me
to
my
room
my
speech
appeared
to
amuse
him
no
no
you
first
said
brutus
i
go
perhaps
you
be
angry
see
and
he
became
so
involved
in
throes
of
merriment
that
i
hoped
he
might
extinguish
the
candle
i
thought
better
of
an
angry
command
which
i
knew
he
would
not
obey
and
turned
through
the
arched
moulding
that
marked
the
entrance
to
the
upper
hall
and
at
his
direction
opened
a
door
as
i
paused
involuntarily
on
the
threshold
brutus
deftly
slipped
past
set
the
candle
on
a
stand
and
bent
over
my
saddle
bags
still
chuckling
to
himself
he
dropped
my
pistols
into
his
shirt
bosom
then
his
grin
died
away
his
low
forehead
became
creased
and
puckered
he
shifted
his
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other
irresolutely
and
drew
a
deep
breath
mister
henry
he
began
well
i
said
something
happen
very
bad
here
you
go
home
his
sudden
change
of
manner
and
the
shadowy
musty
silence
around
me
threatened
to
shake
the
coolness
i
had
attempted
to
assume
unconsciously
my
hand
dropped
to
the
hilt
of
my
travelling
sword
i
looked
across
at
him
through
the
shadows
you
go
home
said
brutus
something
happen
or
something
happened
i
asked
but
brutus
only
shook
his
head
stupidly
very
bad
you
go
home
he
persisted
you
go
to
the
devil
i
said
and
leave
that
candle
i
wo
burn
down
the
house
he
moved
reluctantly
towards
the
door
monsieur
very
angry
said
brutus
shut
the
door
i
said
the
draft
is
blowing
the
candle
he
pulled
it
to
without
another
word
and
i
could
hear
him
fumbling
with
the
lock
for
the
last
ten
years
i
doubt
if
anything
had
been
changed
in
that
room
except
for
the
addition
of
three
blankets
which
brutus
had
evidently
laid
some
hours
before
on
the
mildewed
mattress
of
the
carved
four
post
bed
my
mother
must
have
ordered
up
the
curtains
that
hung
over
it
in
yellowed
faded
tatters
the
charred
wood
of
a
fire
that
had
been
lighted
when
the
room
was
new
still
lay
over
the
green
clotted
andirons
the
dampness
of
a
seaside
town
had
cracked
and
warped
the
furniture
and
had
turned
the
mirrors
into
sad
mockeries
the
strange
musty
odor
of
unused
houses
hung
heavy
in
the
air
i
sat
quiet
for
a
while
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
alert
for
some
sound
outside
but
in
the
hall
it
was
very
still
then
my
hand
fell
again
on
the
hilt
of
my
travelling
sword
that
my
father
had
overlooked
it
increased
the
resentment
i
bore
him
slowly
i
drew
the
blade
and
tested
its
perfect
balance
and
limbered
my
wrist
in
a
few
idle
passes
at
the
fringe
of
the
bed
curtain
then
i
knotted
it
over
my
hand
tossed
a
blanket
over
me
and
blew
out
the
light
from
where
i
lay
i
could
see
the
running
lights
of
the
shelton
ships
swaying
in
a
freshening
breeze
three
together
in
port
for
the
first
time
in
ten
years
the
sky
had
become
so
overcast
that
every
shape
outside
had
merged
into
an
inky
monotone
i
could
hear
the
low
murmur
of
the
wind
twisting
through
the
branches
of
our
elms
and
the
whistle
of
it
as
it
passed
our
gables
once
below
i
heard
my
step
quick
and
decisive
his
voice
raised
to
give
an
order
and
the
closing
of
a
door
gradually
the
thoughts
which
were
racing
through
my
mind
as
thoughts
sometimes
do
when
the
candle
is
out
and
the
room
you
lie
in
grows
intangible
and
vast
assumed
a
relativity
i
smiled
to
myself
in
the
darkness
there
was
one
thing
that
evening
which
my
father
had
overlooked
we
both
were
proud
he
still
seemed
to
be
near
me
still
seemed
to
be
watching
me
with
his
cool
half
smile
if
his
voice
pleasant
level
and
passionless
had
broken
the
silence
about
me
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
strange
how
little
he
had
changed
and
how
much
i
had
expected
to
see
him
altered
i
could
still
remember
the
last
time
the
years
between
seemed
only
a
little
while
we
had
been
very
gay
the
card
tables
had
been
out
and
he
had
been
playing
politely
detached
seemingly
in
his
own
thoughts
and
yet
alertly
courteous
i
could
see
him
now
pushing
a
handful
of
gold
towards
his
right
hand
neighbor
and
the
clink
of
the
metal
and
its
color
seemed
to
please
him
for
he
ran
his
fingers
lightly
through
the
coins
and
then
yes
brutus
had
lighted
me
to
my
room
could
it
have
been
ten
years
ago
as
i
lay
staring
at
the
blackness
ahead
of
me
my
thoughts
returned
to
the
room
i
had
quitted
had
she
been
about
to
thank
me
i
heard
his
slow
cynical
voice
interrupting
me
and
felt
her
hand
drop
from
my
arm
then
in
a
strange
even
cadence
a
sentence
of
his
began
running
through
my
memory
it
might
be
interesting
hilarious
in
fact
if
it
were
not
for
the
lady
in
the
case
vii
something
was
pressing
on
my
shoulder
thrusting
me
slowly
into
consciousness
half
awake
i
wrenched
myself
free
snatching
for
my
sword
as
i
did
so
it
was
a
chill
and
cloudy
morning
and
brutus
was
standing
by
my
bed
holding
a
bowl
of
chocolate
between
a
thumb
and
forefinger
that
made
the
piece
of
china
look
as
delicately
fragile
as
a
flower
eleven
he
said
you
sleep
late
i
looked
at
him
blankly
still
trying
to
shake
off
the
drowsiness
that
crowded
upon
me
it
seemed
only
a
few
minutes
back
that
he
had
lighted
me
to
that
room
he
must
have
detected
a
shade
of
suspicion
in
the
look
i
gave
him
too
much
wine
said
brutus
quickly
but
when
he
spoke
i
knew
it
was
not
wine
that
made
me
sleep
the
whole
night
through
he
thrust
the
bowl
he
was
holding
nearer
to
me
and
now
you
poison
me
i
remarked
but
he
shook
his
head
in
emphatic
negation
hah
he
grunted
and
emitted
a
curious
chuckle
that
caused
me
to
give
him
my
full
attention
you
find
the
morning
amusing
brutus
i
asked
he
gulped
and
nodded
in
assent
last
night
you
kill
me
now
i
give
you
chocolate
he
he
i
glanced
at
him
over
the
edge
of
the
chocolate
bowl
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
anyone
laugh
at
so
truly
a
christian
doctrine
monsieur
sends
compliments
he
said
brutus
came
my
father
voice
across
the
hall
tell
him
i
will
see
him
as
soon
as
he
has
finished
dressing
he
was
sitting
before
his
fire
wrapped
in
a
dressing
gown
of
chinese
silk
embroidered
with
flowers
by
the
tongs
and
shovel
lay
a
pair
of
riding
boots
still
so
wet
and
that
he
must
have
pulled
them
off
within
the
hour
a
decanter
of
rum
was
near
him
on
a
stand
on
his
knee
was
a
volume
of
rabelais
which
was
affording
him
decorous
amusement
brutus
was
busy
gathering
up
the
gray
satin
small
clothes
of
the
previous
day
which
had
been
tossed
in
a
careless
heap
on
the
floor
and
i
perceived
that
they
also
bore
the
marks
of
travel
careful
mentors
who
had
taken
a
lively
pleasure
in
their
teaching
had
been
at
pains
to
tell
me
that
he
was
a
man
of
irregular
habits
yet
with
indulgent
politeness
he
remained
blandly
reticent
for
him
the
day
seemed
to
have
started
afresh
independent
and
unrelated
to
other
days
it
had
awakened
in
him
a
genial
spirit
far
brighter
than
the
morning
he
greeted
me
with
a
gay
wave
of
the
hand
and
a
nod
of
invitation
towards
the
rum
my
refusal
served
only
to
increase
his
courteous
good
nature
a
very
good
morning
to
you
my
son
he
said
so
you
have
slept
gad
how
i
envy
you
it
is
hard
to
be
a
man
of
affairs
and
still
rest
with
any
regularity
he
waved
me
to
a
chair
in
a
slow
sweeping
gesture
timed
and
directed
so
that
it
ended
at
the
rum
decanter
you
will
pardon
my
addressing
you
through
brutus
he
continued
confidentially
but
it
is
a
habit
of
mine
which
i
find
it
hard
to
break
i
am
eccentric
my
son
i
never
speak
to
anyone
of
a
morning
till
i
have
finished
my
cup
of
chocolate
i
have
seen
too
many
quarrels
flare
up
over
an
empty
stomach
he
stretched
a
foot
nearer
the
blaze
and
smiled
comfortably
at
the
hissing
back
log
and
it
would
be
a
pity
to
have
a
falling
out
on
such
a
morning
as
this
a
very
great
pity
to
be
sure
the
very
thought
of
it
seemed
to
give
him
pause
for
pleased
though
thoughtful
contemplation
for
he
sipped
his
rum
in
silence
until
the
tumbler
was
half
empty
once
in
bordeaux
he
volunteered
at
last
there
was
a
man
whom
i
fear
i
provoked
quite
needlessly
all
because
i
was
walking
in
the
garden
with
a
headache
and
my
chocolate
was
late
lay
out
the
other
shirt
brutus
i
must
be
well
dressed
today
what
was
it
i
was
saying
that
you
were
walking
in
the
garden
with
a
headache
i
reminded
him
surely
you
had
something
better
to
walk
with
near
at
hand
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
drained
his
glass
and
wiped
his
fingers
carefully
on
a
cambric
handkerchief
either
that
or
my
conscience
he
replied
and
oddly
enough
i
preferred
the
headache
he
might
have
been
alive
today
if
i
had
had
my
chocolate
poor
man
he
sighed
you
wanted
to
see
me
i
asked
or
simply
to
impress
me
he
raised
a
hand
in
shocked
denial
pray
do
not
believe
i
am
so
vulgar
he
replied
yes
i
wished
to
see
you
henry
for
two
reasons
first
i
was
absentminded
last
evening
i
find
i
do
not
know
the
name
of
the
gentleman
with
whom
you
had
the
falling
out
if
you
tell
me
who
knows
the
world
is
small
he
waited
expectantly
and
i
smiled
at
him
i
had
hoped
he
would
ask
me
you
really
care
to
know
his
name
it
might
be
useful
he
confessed
as
i
said
who
knows
perhaps
we
may
have
something
in
common
some
little
mutual
interest
i
am
sure
you
have
i
told
him
the
man
i
fought
with
was
lawton
at
my
uncle
country
house
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
i
thought
he
was
astonished
i
thought
that
the
look
he
gave
was
almost
one
of
respect
but
it
was
hard
to
tell
and
you
wounded
him
he
asked
quickly
i
hardly
think
lawton
expected
it
i
acknowledged
i
fear
he
mused
that
the
years
are
telling
on
lawton
and
your
uncle
jason
knew
of
this
unpleasantness
not
until
afterwards
of
course
he
was
shocked
i
nodded
you
had
another
reason
for
seeing
me
i
asked
yes
he
replied
a
simple
one
i
did
not
want
you
to
go
downstairs
till
i
went
with
you
another
cup
of
chocolate
brutus
this
morning
my
son
i
am
consuming
two
cups
of
chocolate
instead
of
one
you
expect
to
find
me
irritable
i
suggested
he
shook
his
head
in
smiling
contradiction
it
is
because
i
have
a
surprise
in
store
for
you
who
do
you
think
has
come
to
see
me
i
am
utterly
at
a
loss
i
said
bowing
unless
it
is
the
constable
on
the
contrary
he
replied
it
is
the
man
i
hate
more
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
only
his
words
however
hinted
that
the
contingency
was
unpleasant
his
tone
was
one
of
pleased
anticipation
he
hummed
a
little
tune
as
brutus
knelt
before
him
to
help
him
on
with
a
new
pair
of
top
boots
spotless
and
shining
a
few
minutes
later
he
stood
before
his
mirror
critically
examining
a
coat
of
blue
broadcloth
it
evidently
satisfied
him
for
he
smiled
back
indulgently
at
his
image
in
the
glass
and
watched
complacently
while
brutus
smoothed
its
folds
a
gentleman
should
always
have
twenty
coats
he
remarked
turning
toward
me
personally
i
never
travel
with
less
than
a
point
in
my
favor
is
it
not
my
son
and
when
we
remember
the
lady
who
accompanies
the
coats
i
bowed
and
he
turned
slowly
back
to
the
mirror
let
us
trust
he
replied
coldly
you
will
not
be
obliged
to
remind
yourself
often
that
she
is
a
lady
and
that
she
shall
be
treated
as
one
both
by
you
and
by
me
as
long
as
she
remains
beneath
this
roof
i
felt
a
pleasing
sense
of
triumph
at
the
success
of
my
remark
and
abruptly
determined
to
drive
it
home
sir
i
said
you
astound
me
astound
you
he
left
his
neckcloth
half
undone
and
stepped
toward
me
alertly
courteous
you
mean
you
take
exception
to
what
i
have
just
said
indeed
not
i
replied
with
another
bow
i
find
you
changed
this
morning
into
a
good
example
instead
of
a
bad
one
and
then
before
he
could
reply
i
leaned
over
the
chair
he
had
quitted
lying
in
the
corner
of
the
faded
upholstery
was
an
oval
of
gold
before
he
perceived
my
intention
i
had
picked
it
up
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
his
hand
fell
on
my
arm
i
looked
up
quickly
his
face
was
close
to
mine
closer
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
placid
still
but
somehow
changed
somehow
so
subtly
different
that
i
wrenched
myself
free
and
stepped
a
pace
away
brutus
dropped
the
coat
he
was
folding
and
shuffled
forward
hastily
how
careless
of
me
to
have
left
it
there
said
my
father
gently
hand
me
the
locket
if
you
please
my
son
and
many
thanks
for
picking
it
up
the
jewelled
clasp
was
under
my
thumb
i
pressed
it
and
the
gold
locket
i
was
holding
flew
open
but
before
i
could
look
further
he
had
struck
a
sharp
blow
at
my
wrist
and
the
locket
fell
from
my
hand
pick
it
up
brutus
he
said
his
eyes
never
leaving
mine
and
we
watched
each
other
for
a
second
in
silence
come
he
said
let
us
go
down
stairs
you
may
find
it
instructive
to
see
how
i
treat
my
enemies
i
am
afraid
i
said
slowly
that
you
will
do
better
without
me
slowly
the
thin
line
of
his
lips
relaxed
and
he
raised
his
hands
to
adjust
his
neckcloth
your
episode
with
lawton
makes
me
quite
sure
of
it
he
answered
in
a
tone
he
might
have
used
to
an
ambitious
school
boy
but
you
forget
you
are
still
pursuing
part
of
your
education
never
never
neglect
an
opportunity
to
learn
my
son
something
tells
me
even
now
you
will
be
repaid
for
your
trouble
come
we
are
late
already
so
i
followed
him
down
the
creaking
stairs
to
the
morning
room
i
could
not
suppress
a
start
as
i
passed
over
the
threshold
in
front
of
our
heavy
mahogany
table
attentively
examining
some
maps
and
charts
that
had
been
scattered
there
was
my
uncle
jason
viii
of
all
the
people
i
had
expected
to
see
that
morning
he
was
the
last
almost
unconsciously
i
recalled
the
little
kindnesses
he
had
rendered
me
busy
as
he
had
been
with
commercial
ventures
there
was
never
a
time
when
he
had
not
stood
ready
with
his
help
and
even
my
father
name
he
had
never
recalled
it
except
with
regretful
affection
in
his
sad
little
reminiscences
of
older
pleasanter
days
i
thought
i
detected
a
trace
of
that
affection
a
trace
of
appeal
almost
in
the
look
he
gave
us
as
we
entered
they
made
a
strange
contrast
my
uncle
and
my
father
in
his
gay
coat
and
laces
his
slender
upright
figure
and
his
face
almost
youthful
beneath
his
powdered
hair
for
my
uncle
was
an
older
man
and
years
and
care
had
slightly
bowed
him
the
wrinkles
were
deep
about
his
mouth
and
eyes
his
brown
hair
simply
dressed
was
gray
already
at
the
temples
his
plain
black
coat
and
knee
breeches
were
wrinkled
from
travel
as
he
often
put
it
he
had
no
time
to
care
for
clothes
yet
his
cheeks
glowed
from
quiet
living
and
there
was
a
sly
good
humored
twinkle
in
his
brown
eyes
which
went
well
with
his
broad
shoulders
and
his
strongly
knit
body
his
reputation
for
genial
good
nature
was
with
him
still
he
stretched
forth
a
hand
but
the
moment
was
inopportune
my
father
had
given
his
undivided
attention
to
the
shutters
on
the
east
windows
he
walked
swiftly
over
and
drew
them
to
snapping
a
bolt
to
hold
them
in
place
then
he
turned
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
slowly
examining
my
uncle
the
while
with
a
cool
judicial
glance
and
then
he
bowed
you
are
growing
old
jason
he
said
by
way
of
greeting
ah
george
said
my
uncle
in
his
deep
pleasant
voice
it
does
me
good
to
see
the
father
and
the
son
together
my
father
joined
the
tips
of
his
fingers
and
regarded
him
solemnly
now
heaven
be
praised
for
that
he
exclaimed
with
a
jovial
fervor
though
it
is
hard
to
believe
jason
that
anything
could
make
you
better
than
you
are
it
was
kind
of
you
not
to
keep
my
son
and
me
apart
my
father
came
a
pace
nearer
his
eyes
never
for
a
moment
leaving
the
man
opposite
his
last
words
seemed
to
make
a
doubtful
impression
on
my
uncle
he
looked
quickly
across
at
me
but
what
he
saw
must
have
relieved
him
ah
that
wit
he
laughed
it
has
been
too
long
george
too
long
since
i
have
tasted
of
it
it
quite
reminds
me
of
the
old
days
george
with
the
dances
and
the
races
and
the
ladies
ah
george
how
they
would
smile
on
you
and
even
today
i
warrant
ah
if
i
only
had
the
receipt
that
keeps
you
young
indeed
you
care
to
know
it
my
father
quite
suddenly
leaned
forward
and
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
as
though
the
abruptness
of
the
gesture
startled
him
my
uncle
drew
hastily
back
and
still
my
father
watched
him
between
them
was
passing
something
which
i
did
not
understand
the
silence
in
the
room
had
become
oppressive
before
my
father
spoke
again
lead
a
life
of
disrepute
he
said
gravely
i
can
not
think
of
a
better
cosmetic
george
cried
my
uncle
in
quick
remonstrance
remember
your
son
is
with
you
and
seems
amply
able
to
look
out
for
himself
surprisingly
able
jason
have
you
not
found
it
so
thank
heaven
yes
he
laughed
and
glanced
hastily
at
me
again
my
father
coat
lapel
was
bothering
him
he
straightened
it
thoughtfully
patted
it
gently
into
place
and
then
said
surely
jason
you
did
not
come
here
to
discuss
the
past
perhaps
not
uncle
jason
replied
with
another
laugh
which
seemed
slightly
out
of
tune
in
the
silence
that
surrounded
him
but
how
can
i
not
be
reminded
of
it
this
room
and
you
indeed
henry
here
is
all
that
brings
me
back
he
is
like
you
george
and
yet
he
paused
to
favor
me
with
another
glance
he
has
his
mother
eyes
my
father
flicked
a
speck
of
dust
from
his
sleeve
suppose
he
suggested
we
leave
your
sister
out
of
the
discussion
let
us
come
down
to
practical
matters
and
leave
the
dead
alone
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
mentioned
her
his
voice
was
coldly
aloof
but
his
hand
began
moving
restlessly
again
over
his
coat
in
search
of
an
imaginary
wrinkle
you
understand
me
he
inquired
gently
after
a
second
pause
pray
remember
jason
i
have
only
two
cheeks
and
i
can
recall
no
biblical
law
to
follow
if
you
should
strike
again
god
bless
me
gasped
my
uncle
in
blank
amazement
i
did
not
come
here
to
quarrel
i
came
because
you
are
in
trouble
i
came
as
soon
as
i
had
heard
of
it
because
you
need
my
help
because
he
had
regained
his
cordial
eloquence
from
the
very
cadence
of
his
words
he
paused
and
i
thought
his
eye
moistened
and
his
voice
quavered
because
blood
is
thicker
than
water
george
at
the
last
words
my
father
inclined
his
head
gravely
and
was
momentarily
silent
as
though
seeking
an
adequate
reply
i
thought
you
would
come
he
said
slowly
in
fact
i
depended
upon
it
before
i
set
sail
from
france
ha
that
relieves
you
does
it
not
jason
yet
for
some
reason
the
statement
seemed
to
have
an
opposite
effect
my
uncle
heavy
brows
knitted
together
and
his
mouth
moved
uneasily
see
my
son
how
the
plot
thickens
said
my
father
turning
to
me
with
a
pleasant
smile
and
all
we
needed
was
a
hero
who
will
it
be
i
wonder
you
or
your
uncle
but
my
uncle
did
not
laugh
again
instead
he
squared
his
shoulders
and
his
manner
became
serious
it
is
not
a
time
to
jest
george
he
said
ominously
do
you
understand
what
you
have
done
but
you
can
not
know
or
else
you
would
not
be
here
you
can
not
know
that
the
house
is
watched
if
he
had
expected
to
surprise
my
father
he
must
have
felt
a
poignant
disappointment
but
perhaps
he
knew
that
surprise
was
a
sentiment
he
seldom
permitted
i
know
replied
my
father
that
since
my
arrival
here
i
have
been
the
object
of
many
flattering
attentions
but
why
are
you
concerned
jason
i
have
broken
no
law
of
the
land
i
have
merely
mixed
myself
up
in
french
politics
uncle
jason
made
an
impatient
gesture
you
have
mixed
yourself
up
in
such
an
important
affair
in
such
a
ridiculous
way
that
every
secret
agent
that
france
has
in
this
country
will
be
in
this
town
in
the
next
twelve
hours
that
all
you
have
done
george
my
father
tapped
his
silver
snuff
box
gently
i
had
hoped
as
much
he
remarked
blandly
when
one
is
the
center
of
interest
it
is
always
better
to
be
the
very
center
you
must
learn
to
know
me
better
jason
and
then
you
will
understand
that
i
always
seek
two
things
i
always
seek
profit
and
pleasure
it
seems
as
though
i
should
find
them
both
in
such
pleasant
company
then
as
if
the
matter
were
settled
he
looked
again
at
the
shuttered
window
and
leaned
down
to
place
another
log
in
the
fire
come
george
urged
my
uncle
let
us
be
serious
your
nonchalance
and
irony
have
been
growing
with
the
years
surely
you
recognize
that
you
have
reached
the
end
of
your
rope
i
tell
you
george
these
men
will
stop
at
nothing
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
returned
my
father
that
i
also
may
stop
at
nothing
my
uncle
frowned
and
then
smiled
bleakly
no
george
he
said
in
a
voice
that
dropped
almost
to
a
whisper
you
are
too
fond
of
life
for
that
suppose
for
a
moment
just
suppose
they
had
means
of
taking
you
back
to
france
just
suppose
there
was
a
boat
in
the
harbor
now
manned
and
victualled
and
waiting
for
the
tide
with
a
cabin
ready
and
irons
they
would
admire
to
see
you
back
in
paris
george
for
a
day
or
perhaps
two
days
i
know
george
they
have
told
me
positively
said
my
father
stifling
a
yawn
behind
his
hand
positively
you
frighten
me
it
is
an
old
sensation
and
tires
me
surely
you
can
be
more
interesting
jason
face
red
and
always
became
a
trifle
redder
we
have
beat
about
the
bush
long
enough
he
said
with
an
abrupt
lack
of
suavity
i
tell
you
once
and
for
all
you
are
running
against
forces
which
are
too
strong
for
you
forces
as
i
have
pointed
out
that
will
do
anything
to
gain
possession
of
a
certain
paper
they
know
you
have
that
paper
george
my
father
shrugged
his
shoulders
indeed
he
said
i
hardly
admire
their
perspicacity
and
they
will
prevent
your
disposing
of
it
at
any
cost
i
tell
you
george
they
will
stop
at
nothing
again
his
voice
dropped
to
a
confidential
monotone
and
that
is
why
i
here
george
my
uncle
concluded
my
father
raised
his
eyebrows
i
fear
my
mind
works
slowly
in
the
early
morning
pardon
me
if
i
still
must
ask
why
are
you
here
quite
suddenly
my
uncle
patience
gave
way
in
a
singular
manner
to
exasperation
exposing
a
side
to
his
character
which
i
had
not
till
then
suspected
because
i
can
save
your
neck
that
why
though
god
knows
you
seem
to
value
it
i
have
interceded
for
you
george
i
have
come
here
to
induce
you
to
give
up
that
paper
peacefully
and
quietly
or
else
to
take
the
consequences
evidently
the
force
he
gave
his
words
contrived
to
drive
them
home
for
my
father
nodded
you
mean
he
inquired
that
they
propose
to
take
me
to
france
and
have
me
handed
over
to
justice
a
political
prisoner
it
is
what
i
meant
george
as
a
man
in
a
plot
to
kill
napoleon
then
his
former
kindliness
returned
and
we
can
not
let
that
happen
can
we
not
if
we
can
prevent
it
my
father
replied
if
the
trouble
is
that
i
have
the
paper
in
my
possession
i
suppose
i
must
let
it
go
uncle
jason
smiled
his
benignest
smile
i
knew
you
would
understand
he
said
with
something
i
took
for
a
sigh
of
relief
i
told
them
you
were
too
sensible
a
man
george
not
to
realize
when
a
thing
was
useless
my
father
drew
the
paper
from
his
breast
pocket
and
looked
at
it
thoughtfully
yes
he
said
slowly
i
suppose
i
must
let
it
go
good
god
what
are
you
doing
cried
my
uncle
my
father
had
turned
to
the
fireplace
and
was
holding
the
paper
over
the
blaze
but
for
some
reason
my
uncle
was
not
relieved
he
made
an
ineffectual
gesture
his
face
became
a
blotched
red
and
white
his
eyes
grew
round
and
staring
and
his
mouth
fell
helplessly
open
stop
he
gasped
for
god
sake
george
stay
where
you
are
jason
said
my
father
i
can
manage
alone
i
think
i
suppose
i
should
have
burned
it
long
ago
he
withdrew
the
paper
slightly
as
if
to
prolong
the
scene
before
him
if
my
uncle
had
been
on
the
verge
of
ruin
he
could
not
have
looked
more
depressed
do
he
cried
will
you
listen
george
i
be
glad
to
pay
you
for
it
my
father
slowly
straightened
placed
the
paper
in
his
pocket
and
bowed
now
he
said
pleasantly
we
are
talking
a
language
i
understand
believe
me
jason
one
of
my
chief
motives
in
keeping
this
document
was
the
hope
that
you
might
realize
its
intrinsic
qualities
uncle
jason
moistened
his
lips
his
call
was
evidently
proving
upsetting
how
much
do
you
want
for
it
he
asked
with
a
slight
tremor
in
his
voice
thousand
dollars
seems
a
fair
demand
said
my
father
in
notes
if
you
please
what
my
uncle
shouted
my
father
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
surveyed
his
visitor
intently
be
silent
he
said
silent
and
very
careful
jason
you
seem
to
forget
that
i
am
a
dangerous
man
and
he
flicked
an
imaginary
bit
of
dust
from
his
cuff
my
uncle
gave
a
hasty
glance
at
the
half
opened
door
and
now
listen
to
me
my
father
continued
his
voice
still
gently
conversational
you
have
tried
to
frighten
me
jason
you
should
have
known
better
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
i
fear
you
least
you
forget
that
i
am
growing
old
and
all
my
senses
are
becoming
duller
fear
along
with
the
rest
you
have
tried
to
cheat
me
of
the
money
i
have
demanded
and
it
has
tried
my
patience
in
fact
it
has
set
my
nerves
quite
on
edge
pray
do
not
irritate
me
again
i
know
you
must
have
that
paper
and
i
know
why
the
price
i
offer
is
a
moderate
one
compared
with
the
unpleasantness
that
may
occur
to
you
if
you
do
not
get
it
never
mind
what
occurrence
i
know
that
you
have
come
here
prepared
to
pay
that
price
the
morning
is
getting
on
you
have
the
money
in
your
inside
pocket
bring
it
out
and
count
it
thousand
dollars
hesitatingly
my
uncle
produced
a
packet
that
crackled
pleasantly
there
i
said
you
had
them
remarked
my
father
serenely
all
perfectly
negotiable
i
hope
jason
in
case
you
should
change
your
mind
i
stood
helplessly
beside
him
beset
with
a
hundred
useless
impulses
silently
i
watched
jason
hill
hold
out
the
notes
and
now
the
paper
said
my
uncle
my
father
examining
the
packet
with
a
minute
care
waved
his
request
aside
first
you
must
let
me
see
what
you
are
giving
me
i
fear
your
hands
are
trembling
too
much
jason
for
you
to
do
justice
to
it
thousand
dollars
it
seems
to
me
i
remember
that
a
similar
sum
once
passed
between
us
in
which
direction
seem
to
have
forgotten
yes
strangely
enough
they
are
quite
correct
a
modest
little
fortune
but
still
something
to
fall
back
on
and
now
the
paper
demanded
my
uncle
ah
to
be
sure
the
paper
said
my
father
and
he
swung
from
the
table
where
he
had
been
sitting
and
smiled
brightly
i
have
changed
my
mind
about
the
paper
jason
and
business
presses
i
fear
it
is
time
to
end
our
interview
you
mean
you
dare
to
accept
a
sum
from
you
in
payment
of
damage
you
have
done
my
character
i
should
not
dare
to
refuse
it
or
let
us
put
it
this
way
jason
the
paper
is
merely
drawing
interest
positively
i
can
not
afford
to
give
it
up
the
red
had
risen
again
to
my
uncle
face
giving
his
features
the
color
of
ugly
magenta
for
a
moment
i
thought
he
was
going
to
leap
at
the
slighter
man
before
him
but
my
father
never
moved
a
muscle
only
stood
attentively
watching
him
with
his
hand
folded
behind
his
back
show
him
the
door
brutus
he
said
briskly
and
as
you
go
jason
remember
this
i
know
exactly
what
dangers
i
am
running
without
your
telling
me
for
that
reason
i
have
ordered
my
servant
to
keep
a
fire
burning
in
every
room
i
occupy
in
this
house
i
make
a
point
of
sitting
near
these
fires
if
you
or
any
of
your
friends
so
much
as
raise
a
finger
against
me
the
paper
is
burned
and
as
for
you
with
a
quick
delicate
motion
he
raised
a
hand
and
drew
a
finger
lightly
across
his
throat
and
as
for
you
jason
even
the
slightest
suspicion
that
you
or
your
paid
murderers
are
interfering
in
any
way
with
my
affairs
will
give
me
too
much
pleasure
i
think
you
understand
pray
do
make
me
overcome
with
joy
jason
and
now
i
wish
you
a
very
good
morning
but
uncle
jason
had
recovered
from
the
first
cold
shock
of
his
surprise
he
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
his
jaw
heavy
and
cumbersome
always
thrust
itself
forward
and
i
could
see
the
veins
swell
dangerously
into
a
tangled
clotted
mass
on
his
temples
his
fingers
worked
convulsively
as
though
clawing
at
some
unseen
object
close
beside
him
and
then
his
breath
whistled
through
his
teeth
you
fool
he
shouted
suddenly
his
temper
bursting
the
weakened
barriers
of
control
you
damned
unregenerate
fool
and
then
for
an
instant
my
father
icy
placidity
left
him
his
lips
leapt
back
from
his
teeth
there
was
a
hissing
whir
of
steel
his
small
sword
made
an
arc
of
light
through
the
yard
of
space
that
parted
them
his
body
lunged
forward
so
you
will
have
it
will
you
his
words
seemed
to
choke
him
take
it
then
he
roared
take
it
to
hell
where
you
belong
it
was
i
say
the
matter
of
an
instant
in
a
leaden
second
he
stood
poised
his
wrist
drawn
back
while
the
eyes
of
the
other
stared
in
horror
at
the
long
thin
blade
and
then
the
welts
of
crimson
that
had
mounted
to
his
face
disfiguring
it
into
a
writhing
fury
slowly
effaced
themselves
his
lips
once
more
assumed
a
thin
immobile
line
again
his
watchful
indolence
returned
to
him
and
slowly
very
slowly
he
lowered
the
point
to
the
floor
scarred
surface
his
voice
returned
to
its
pleasant
modulation
and
with
his
words
returned
his
icy
little
smile
your
pardon
jason
he
said
i
fear
i
have
been
too
much
myself
this
morning
thank
your
god
if
you
have
one
that
i
was
not
entirely
natural
take
him
away
brutus
he
shall
live
a
little
longer
but
brutus
had
no
need
to
obey
the
order
my
father
stood
still
smiling
watching
the
empty
doorway
then
i
realized
that
i
was
very
cold
and
weak
and
that
my
knees
were
sagging
beneath
me
i
walked
unsteadily
to
the
table
and
leaned
upon
it
heavily
thoughtfully
my
father
sheathed
his
small
sword
ix
the
morning
begins
auspiciously
does
it
not
my
son
he
said
and
still
the
day
is
young
indeed
it
can
not
be
more
than
eleven
of
the
clock
the
rum
decanter
brutus
the
lines
about
his
mouth
softened
as
his
gaze
met
mine
and
his
smile
grew
broader
i
pride
myself
he
went
on
that
my
example
is
all
i
promised
i
fear
i
shall
fall
down
in
only
one
respect
perhaps
you
have
observed
it
if
i
have
i
answered
i
have
forgotten
my
table
manners
he
said
i
fear
they
are
almost
impeccable
and
he
walked
over
to
the
window
taking
care
i
noticed
not
to
stand
in
front
of
it
sad
is
it
not
that
i
should
fail
in
such
a
trivial
matter
but
it
happened
so
long
ago
while
i
was
courting
your
mother
to
be
exact
my
rest
his
soul
was
an
atrocity
at
table
the
viands
my
son
scattered
from
his
knife
over
the
board
like
chaff
before
the
flail
yet
will
you
believe
it
any
time
he
chose
to
speak
his
mouth
was
always
full
i
watched
him
watched
him
with
wonder
or
was
it
horror
i
can
not
remember
which
and
i
resolved
to
go
to
go
anywhere
but
never
to
do
likewise
the
result
today
is
perhaps
unfortunate
yet
watch
me
my
son
even
in
that
you
see
the
practical
value
of
a
bad
example
yes
i
said
i
am
watching
you
he
seemed
about
to
turn
from
the
window
and
then
something
outside
held
his
attention
ha
he
said
a
sloop
is
coming
in
a
clumsy
looking
vessel
whose
is
it
henry
i
walked
to
the
window
to
get
a
better
look
but
he
reached
out
and
drew
me
near
him
let
us
be
careful
of
the
windows
this
morning
the
light
is
bad
and
we
have
very
much
the
same
figure
there
now
you
can
see
it
out
by
the
bar
it
carries
too
much
canvas
forward
and
spills
half
the
wind
have
you
seen
it
before
henry
the
sun
had
been
trying
to
break
through
the
clouds
and
a
few
rays
had
crept
out
and
glanced
on
the
angry
gray
of
the
water
so
that
it
shone
here
and
there
like
scratches
in
dull
lead
the
three
ships
near
our
wharf
were
tossing
fitfully
and
on
all
three
the
crews
were
busy
with
the
rigging
out
further
towards
the
broad
curve
of
the
horizon
was
the
white
smear
of
a
sail
and
as
i
looked
i
could
see
the
lines
beneath
the
canvas
he
was
right
it
was
a
sloop
running
free
with
the
tide
pushing
her
on
yes
i
said
i
know
the
boat
though
i
do
not
see
why
she
is
putting
in
ah
said
my
father
and
do
you
not
and
whose
boat
may
she
be
henry
two
days
ago
she
sailed
from
boston
for
france
she
belongs
to
jason
hill
i
told
him
and
a
little
puzzled
i
looked
again
at
the
low
dunes
and
the
marshes
by
the
harbor
mouth
i
think
my
father
murmured
half
to
himself
that
perhaps
after
all
i
should
have
killed
him
brutus
brutus
who
had
watched
the
scene
with
the
same
aloof
politeness
that
he
might
have
watched
guests
at
the
dinner
table
moved
quickly
forward
has
no
word
come
yet
brutus
grinned
and
shook
his
head
the
devil
said
my
father
aiken
was
here
last
evening
and
got
the
message
i
left
him
brutus
nodded
and
my
father
compressed
his
lips
apparently
deep
in
thought
he
took
a
few
unhurried
steps
across
the
room
and
glanced
about
him
critically
a
busy
day
my
son
he
said
a
very
busy
day
and
a
humorous
one
as
well
they
think
they
can
get
the
paper
they
think
but
they
are
all
mistaken
you
are
sure
i
inquired
perfectly
said
my
father
i
shall
dispose
of
it
in
my
own
way
i
am
merely
waiting
for
the
time
huh
brutus
cupped
his
great
hand
behind
his
ear
and
nodded
violently
my
father
stepped
toward
the
hallway
and
listened
above
the
hissing
of
the
fire
i
heard
a
voice
and
footsteps
he
straightened
the
lace
about
his
wrists
and
his
features
lost
their
strained
attention
as
he
turned
towards
brutus
he
seemed
younger
and
more
alertly
active
than
i
had
ever
known
him
ah
what
a
day
he
said
what
a
day
to
be
sure
they
are
coming
brutus
gad
but
the
years
have
been
long
since
i
have
waited
for
them
place
the
glasses
on
the
table
brutus
we
still
must
be
hospitable
the
knocker
on
our
front
door
sent
a
violent
summons
but
my
father
did
not
seem
to
hear
it
with
graceful
deliberation
he
was
filling
six
glasses
from
the
decanter
keep
to
the
back
of
the
room
my
son
he
said
and
listen
who
do
you
think
is
coming
but
you
never
can
guess
our
neighbors
my
son
our
neighbors
first
your
uncle
and
then
our
neighbors
we
are
holding
a
distinguished
salon
are
we
not
but
before
i
could
answer
or
even
conjecture
why
he
should
receive
such
a
visit
my
father
gave
a
low
exclamation
partly
of
surprise
and
partly
of
well
concealed
annoyance
and
stepped
forward
bowing
low
mademoiselle
but
very
pale
had
run
into
the
morning
room
the
paper
captain
she
cried
are
they
coming
for
the
paper
for
if
they
are
they
shall
not
have
it
you
my
father
looked
at
her
sharply
almost
suspiciously
how
are
you
here
he
demanded
quickly
did
not
brutus
lock
your
door
the
lock
was
very
rusty
she
answered
indeed
said
my
father
and
how
long
ago
did
you
find
it
out
only
a
minute
back
she
said
and
again
he
glanced
at
her
narrowly
and
finally
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
i
look
back
on
it
it
was
his
first
mistake
then
i
fear
you
have
not
seen
much
of
the
house
he
said
suavely
but
she
disregarded
his
remark
pray
do
not
be
alarmed
my
lady
at
almost
any
time
i
am
glad
to
see
you
but
just
at
present
he
raised
his
voice
to
drown
the
din
of
the
knocker
just
at
present
your
appearance
i
fear
is
a
trifle
indiscreet
it
is
not
the
paper
they
wish
mademoiselle
it
is
merely
myself
your
humble
servant
they
require
but
pray
calm
yourself
and
rest
assured
they
shall
get
neither
let
in
our
callers
brutus
he
took
her
hand
and
bowed
over
it
very
low
and
looked
for
an
instant
into
her
eyes
with
a
faint
hint
of
curiosity
and
you
she
asked
you
have
it
still
temporarily
yes
he
answered
show
mademoiselle
a
chair
my
son
over
there
behind
me
where
you
both
can
witness
the
little
drama
perhaps
it
is
as
well
she
came
after
all
brutus
had
not
forgotten
his
days
as
a
house
servant
erect
and
uncompromising
he
entered
the
room
facing
toward
us
by
the
door
mr
penfield
he
called
captain
tracy
captain
brown
major
proctor
lane
captain
dexter
so
said
major
proctor
you
still
have
your
damned
party
manners
they
had
entered
the
room
and
stood
in
a
group
before
my
father
their
faces
were
set
grimly
their
manner
was
stern
and
uncompromising
as
befitted
men
of
unimpeachable
position
and
integrity
as
i
watched
them
i
still
was
wondering
at
their
errand
why
should
they
of
all
people
have
paid
this
call
there
was
not
one
who
did
not
own
his
ships
and
counting
house
not
one
who
was
not
a
leading
trader
in
our
seaport
in
all
the
years
i
had
known
them
not
one
had
looked
at
me
or
given
me
a
civil
word
and
indeed
they
had
little
reason
to
give
one
and
yet
here
they
were
calling
on
my
father
it
was
an
odd
contradiction
of
the
lesson
books
that
of
all
the
men
in
the
room
he
should
appear
the
most
prepossessing
though
many
of
them
were
younger
his
clothes
were
more
in
fashion
and
time
had
touched
him
with
a
lighter
hand
if
i
had
come
on
them
all
as
strangers
i
should
have
expected
kindness
and
understanding
from
him
first
of
any
his
forehead
was
broader
and
his
glance
was
keener
indeed
there
was
none
who
looked
more
the
gentleman
there
was
no
man
who
could
have
displayed
more
perfect
courtesy
in
his
gravely
polite
salute
this
said
my
father
smiling
is
indeed
a
pleasure
i
had
hoped
for
this
honor
and
yet
the
years
have
so
often
disappointed
me
that
i
had
only
hoped
captain
tracy
short
and
squat
his
hands
held
out
in
the
way
old
sailors
have
as
though
ready
instinctively
to
grasp
some
rope
or
bulwark
thrust
a
bull
neck
forward
and
peered
at
my
father
with
little
reddened
eyes
opened
in
wide
incredulity
you
what
he
demanded
hoarsely
i
said
captain
tracy
that
i
hoped
and
my
father
helped
himself
to
snuff
will
you
be
seated
gentlemen
no
said
major
proctor
i
have
always
noted
my
father
remarked
that
standing
is
better
for
the
figure
the
climate
major
has
agreed
with
you
major
proctor
launched
on
a
savage
rejoinder
but
penfield
leaned
towards
him
with
a
whispered
admonition
i
take
it
he
said
to
my
father
that
you
did
not
read
our
letter
you
made
a
mistake
shelton
a
grave
mistake
in
not
doing
so
i
am
fond
of
reading
said
my
father
and
i
found
your
letter
pardon
my
rudeness
but
i
must
be
frank
i
found
your
letter
most
amusing
lane
stretched
a
hand
toward
him
you
always
did
laugh
he
cried
shrilly
never
now
lane
replied
my
father
yet
i
must
admit
if
laughter
were
my
habit
he
paused
and
surveyed
lane
pinched
and
bony
figure
you
found
the
letter
amusing
eh
snapped
captain
tracy
you
found
it
funny
when
we
ordered
you
out
of
this
town
did
you
i
suppose
you
thought
we
were
joking
eh
well
by
gad
we
were
and
that
what
we
come
to
tell
you
heaven
help
us
if
we
do
see
you
out
on
a
rail
you
damned
gently
gently
interjected
penfield
in
a
soothing
tone
let
us
not
use
any
harder
words
than
necessary
shelton
will
agree
with
us
i
am
sure
shelton
did
not
understand
perhaps
shelton
has
forgotten
my
memory
said
my
father
still
remains
unimpaired
i
recall
the
last
time
i
saw
you
was
some
ten
years
ago
in
this
very
house
i
recall
at
the
time
you
warned
me
never
to
return
here
in
some
ways
perhaps
you
were
right
and
yet
at
present
i
find
my
residence
here
most
expedient
indeed
i
find
it
quite
impossible
to
leave
frankly
gentlemen
the
house
is
watched
and
it
is
as
much
as
my
life
is
worth
to
stir
outside
the
doors
good
god
cried
lane
in
the
shrill
voice
that
fitted
him
so
well
we
might
have
known
it
there
was
a
momentary
silence
and
major
proctor
whispered
in
penfield
ear
captain
shelton
said
penfield
i
see
your
son
and
a
woman
are
in
the
room
it
might
be
better
if
you
sent
them
away
your
son
i
have
heard
has
learned
to
behave
himself
there
is
no
need
for
him
to
hear
what
we
have
to
say
to
you
there
was
a
note
of
raillery
in
his
voice
that
must
have
offended
my
father
penfield
is
mistaken
i
fear
closed
shutters
make
the
room
a
trifle
dark
to
see
clearly
it
is
a
lady
penfield
who
is
with
us
captain
tracy
laughed
my
father
hand
dropped
to
his
side
for
a
moment
no
one
spoke
captain
tracy
moved
his
head
half
an
inch
further
forward
well
he
asked
let
us
leave
the
matter
for
a
moment
said
my
father
it
can
wait
pray
continue
penfield
my
son
will
be
glad
to
listen
penfield
cleared
his
throat
and
looked
at
the
others
uncertainly
go
on
penfield
said
the
major
shelton
began
penfield
stiffly
ten
years
ago
you
were
a
gentleman
could
it
have
been
possible
said
my
father
with
a
bow
ten
years
ago
you
were
a
man
that
every
one
of
us
here
trusted
and
respected
a
friend
of
several
in
the
war
of
the
revolution
you
conducted
yourself
like
a
man
of
honor
you
equipped
your
own
brig
with
a
letter
of
marque
and
sailed
it
yourself
off
jamaica
you
fought
in
three
engagements
you
displayed
a
daring
and
bravery
which
we
once
admired
could
it
have
been
possible
my
father
bowed
again
i
do
recall
i
failed
to
stay
at
home
he
added
bowing
again
to
penfield
penfield
frowned
and
continued
a
little
more
quickly
and
when
you
did
return
you
engaged
in
the
china
trade
you
were
a
successful
man
shelton
we
looked
upon
you
as
one
of
the
more
brilliant
younger
men
of
our
seaport
we
trusted
you
captain
shelton
could
it
have
been
possible
exclaimed
my
father
yes
said
penfield
in
a
louder
tone
we
trusted
you
you
have
only
to
look
at
your
books
if
you
have
kept
them
to
remember
that
my
books
said
my
father
still
contrive
to
balance
in
the
year
penfield
went
on
you
remember
that
year
do
you
not
in
that
year
the
six
of
us
here
engaged
in
a
venture
from
the
north
we
had
carried
here
five
hundred
bales
of
fur
valued
at
fifty
dollars
to
the
bale
you
contracted
with
us
captain
shelton
to
convey
those
bales
to
england
it
would
have
been
a
nice
piece
of
business
if
your
supercargo
had
not
been
an
honest
man
he
knew
you
shelton
if
we
did
not
he
knew
the
game
you
had
planned
to
play
and
though
he
was
your
he
was
man
enough
to
stop
it
penfield
voice
had
risen
so
that
it
rang
through
the
room
and
his
words
followed
each
other
in
cold
indictment
the
others
stood
watching
my
father
with
strained
attention
indeed
he
said
yes
said
penfield
as
you
so
aptly
put
it
indeed
your
ship
carrying
that
consignment
had
jason
hill
as
supercargo
and
ned
aiken
that
damned
parasite
of
yours
as
master
a
day
out
from
this
port
a
plank
sprung
aft
which
obliged
him
to
put
back
to
boston
for
repairs
the
cargo
was
when
it
was
aboard
again
jason
hill
happened
to
examine
that
cargo
the
furs
had
gone
in
their
place
five
hundred
bales
of
chips
had
been
loaded
in
the
hold
he
went
to
the
master
for
an
explanation
aiken
who
had
been
drinking
heavily
was
asleep
in
the
cabin
and
on
the
table
beside
him
was
a
letter
shelton
you
remember
that
letter
it
bore
instructions
from
you
to
scuttle
that
ship
ten
miles
out
of
liverpool
harbor
and
said
my
father
with
another
bow
i
was
to
collect
the
insurance
it
was
nicely
planned
if
you
remember
that
you
recall
what
happened
next
we
called
on
you
shelton
and
accused
you
of
what
you
had
done
you
neither
confirmed
nor
denied
it
we
told
you
then
to
leave
the
town
we
warned
you
never
to
return
we
warned
you
that
we
were
through
with
your
trickery
we
were
through
with
your
cheating
and
your
thieving
we
warned
you
shelton
and
now
you
back
back
by
your
own
confession
on
another
rogue
errand
not
on
another
my
father
objected
mildly
one
of
my
own
penfield
the
experience
you
have
outlined
so
lucidly
convinced
me
that
it
was
better
to
stick
closely
to
my
own
affairs
shelton
penfield
went
on
regardless
of
the
interruption
we
warned
you
yesterday
to
leave
the
town
before
nightfall
and
you
have
failed
to
take
our
advice
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
leave
replied
my
father
easily
i
am
comfortable
here
for
the
moment
i
would
not
be
outside
even
the
arguments
you
have
given
are
specious
you
got
your
furs
back
and
if
i
recall
they
proved
to
be
so
badly
moth
eaten
that
they
were
not
fit
for
any
trade
even
though
you
see
no
reason
said
major
proctor
smoothly
you
are
going
to
leave
shelton
you
are
going
to
leave
in
one
hour
if
you
delay
a
minute
later
we
will
come
with
friends
who
will
know
how
to
handle
you
we
will
come
in
an
hour
with
a
tar
pot
and
a
feather
mattress
you
are
not
only
unwelcome
to
us
on
account
of
your
past
said
penfield
but
more
recent
developments
make
it
impossible
quite
impossible
for
you
to
stay
we
have
heard
your
story
already
from
jason
hill
you
are
right
that
it
is
no
concern
of
ours
except
that
we
remember
the
good
of
this
town
we
have
a
business
with
france
and
we
can
not
afford
to
lose
it
major
proctor
was
blunt
just
now
and
yet
he
is
right
give
us
credit
for
warning
you
at
least
you
will
go
of
course
my
father
smiled
again
and
smoothed
the
wrinkles
of
his
coat
for
some
reason
the
scene
seemed
vastly
pleasant
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
a
deprecatory
gesture
walked
over
to
the
table
and
lifted
up
a
glass
of
ram
i
remarked
before
that
i
was
quite
comfortable
here
he
replied
after
a
moment
pause
i
may
add
that
i
am
amused
since
i
have
returned
to
the
ancestral
roof
and
looked
again
at
the
portraits
of
my
family
i
have
had
many
callers
to
entertain
me
two
have
tried
to
rob
me
one
has
threatened
me
with
death
and
now
six
come
and
threaten
me
with
tar
and
feathers
positively
it
is
too
diverting
to
leave
pray
do
interrupt
me
captain
tracy
in
a
moment
you
shall
have
the
floor
he
took
a
sip
from
his
rum
glass
watching
them
over
the
brim
and
then
he
continued
slowly
and
coldly
yet
turning
every
period
with
a
perfect
courtesy
there
is
one
thing
only
one
that
you
and
all
my
other
callers
appear
to
have
overlooked
you
fail
for
some
reason
to
realize
that
i
do
things
only
of
my
own
volition
it
is
eccentric
i
know
but
we
all
have
our
failings
he
paused
to
place
his
glass
daintily
on
the
table
and
straightened
the
lace
at
his
wrist
with
careful
solicitude
once
before
this
morning
i
have
stated
that
i
am
not
particularly
afraid
of
anything
strange
as
it
may
seem
this
statement
still
applies
or
put
it
this
way
i
have
grown
blase
people
have
threatened
me
too
often
no
gentlemen
you
are
going
to
lose
your
trading
privileges
i
think
and
i
am
going
to
remain
in
my
house
quite
as
long
as
i
choose
which
will
be
one
hour
said
major
proctor
be
careful
major
said
my
father
you
have
grown
too
stout
to
risk
your
words
do
you
care
to
know
why
i
am
going
to
remain
no
one
answered
then
i
will
tell
you
he
went
on
three
of
my
ships
are
in
the
harbor
and
times
are
troublesome
at
sea
they
are
armed
with
heavy
metal
and
manned
by
quite
as
reckless
and
unpleasant
a
lot
of
men
as
i
have
ever
beheld
on
a
deck
between
them
they
have
seventeen
guns
of
varying
calibre
and
there
is
powder
in
their
magazines
do
i
need
to
go
any
further
or
do
we
understand
each
other
no
snapped
captain
tracy
hoarsely
i
damned
if
we
do
it
sounds
crude
as
i
say
it
he
continued
apologetically
and
yet
true
nevertheless
as
soon
as
i
see
anyone
of
you
or
any
of
my
other
neighbors
enter
my
grounds
again
i
shall
order
my
ships
to
tack
down
the
river
and
open
fire
on
the
town
they
have
sail
ready
now
gentlemen
my
servant
has
gone
already
to
carry
them
my
order
and
you
hang
for
piracy
tomorrow
morning
laughed
the
major
harshly
shelton
you
have
grown
mad
exactly
said
my
father
gently
mad
major
mad
enough
to
put
my
threat
into
effect
in
five
minutes
if
you
do
not
leave
this
house
mad
enough
to
scuttle
every
ship
in
this
harbor
mad
enough
to
set
your
warehouses
in
flames
mad
enough
even
to
find
the
company
of
you
and
your
friends
most
damnably
dull
and
wearisome
mad
enough
to
wonder
why
i
ever
suffered
you
to
remain
so
long
beneath
my
roof
mad
enough
to
believe
you
a
pack
of
curs
and
cowards
and
mad
enough
to
treat
you
as
such
keep
off
tracy
you
bloated
fool
by
god
captain
tracy
shouted
we
burn
this
house
over
your
head
in
an
hour
we
have
you
shot
against
the
town
hall
perhaps
said
my
father
and
yet
i
doubt
it
pray
remember
that
i
keep
my
word
your
hats
are
in
the
hall
gentlemen
in
three
minutes
now
my
ships
weigh
anchor
if
you
do
not
go
i
can
not
stop
them
penfield
had
grown
a
trifle
pale
captain
shelton
he
demanded
slowly
are
you
entirely
serious
i
almost
believe
you
are
of
course
you
understand
the
consequences
perfectly
said
my
father
let
us
go
gentlemen
said
penfield
you
will
hear
from
us
later
and
he
turned
quickly
towards
the
hall
as
he
did
so
my
father
drew
back
his
right
arm
and
drove
his
fist
into
captain
tracy
upturned
face
his
blow
was
well
directed
for
the
captain
staggered
and
fell
in
almost
the
same
motion
he
wheeled
on
major
proctor
who
had
started
back
and
was
tugging
at
his
sword
later
perhaps
major
he
said
without
even
lifting
his
voice
but
today
i
am
busy
pray
take
him
away
he
was
always
indiscreet
and
you
he
added
to
lane
surely
you
know
well
enough
not
to
try
conclusions
with
me
take
him
away
your
hats
are
in
the
hall
i
shall
show
you
the
door
myself
after
you
gentlemen
and
he
followed
them
closing
the
door
gently
behind
him
x
mademoiselle
who
had
risen
from
her
chair
where
she
had
listened
only
half
understanding
the
conversation
in
a
tongue
foreign
from
hers
stared
at
the
closed
door
her
lips
parted
and
her
forehead
wrinkled
what
have
they
been
saying
she
asked
why
are
they
afraid
is
everyone
afraid
of
this
father
of
yours
and
then
impulsively
she
seized
me
by
the
arm
but
it
makes
no
difference
come
it
is
our
one
chance
come
quickly
monsieur
i
must
speak
to
you
where
he
will
not
disturb
us
but
where
i
asked
still
staring
straight
before
me
and
then
i
noticed
a
bolt
on
the
morning
room
door
i
sprang
toward
it
and
drew
it
hastily
it
will
do
no
good
to
talk
mademoiselle
if
you
had
understood
and
as
i
spoke
the
enormity
of
the
thing
loomed
still
larger
before
me
mademoiselle
this
morning
he
has
robbed
my
uncle
of
a
fortune
snatched
it
from
him
here
in
this
very
room
and
now
he
has
threatened
to
move
his
ships
into
midstream
and
to
open
fire
on
the
town
and
mademoiselle
he
means
to
do
it
i
thought
once
but
he
means
to
do
it
mademoiselle
she
pursed
her
lips
and
looked
at
me
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
pouf
she
said
so
you
are
growing
frightened
also
yet
i
can
understand
the
marquis
always
said
that
captain
shelton
could
frighten
the
devil
himself
frightened
i
echoed
and
the
blood
rushed
into
my
cheeks
mon
dieu
perhaps
you
are
not
listen
monsieur
i
am
not
taunting
you
i
am
not
saying
he
will
not
he
is
serious
monsieur
and
you
must
leave
him
alone
or
perhaps
i
shall
not
get
the
paper
after
all
and
remember
i
must
have
it
my
brother
must
have
it
and
he
shall
only
you
must
not
disturb
him
he
may
shoot
at
the
town
if
he
cares
to
or
murder
your
uncle
he
has
often
spoken
of
it
at
blanzy
but
the
paper
is
another
matter
you
must
leave
it
to
me
to
you
i
cried
precisely
said
mademoiselle
you
what
can
you
do
you
are
young
you
are
inexperienced
pardon
me
but
you
would
be
quite
ineffective
my
cheeks
flamed
again
somehow
no
sarcasm
of
my
father
had
bitten
as
deep
as
those
last
words
of
hers
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
chagrin
or
anger
that
i
felt
at
the
bitter
sense
of
my
own
futility
and
she
had
seen
it
all
as
coldly
and
as
accurately
as
my
father
she
had
watched
me
and
as
coldly
she
had
given
her
verdict
she
was
watching
me
now
with
a
cool
confident
smile
that
made
me
turn
away
ah
she
said
i
have
hurt
you
and
believe
me
i
did
not
mean
to
something
in
the
polite
impersonality
of
her
voice
gave
me
a
vague
resentment
she
had
moved
nearer
and
yet
i
could
not
meet
her
glance
i
am
sorry
she
said
and
paused
expectantly
but
i
could
only
stare
at
the
floor
in
silence
believe
me
i
am
sorry
it
might
have
been
different
if
i
had
detected
the
slightest
contrition
but
instead
i
seemed
only
to
afford
her
mild
amusement
there
is
no
need
to
be
sorry
i
replied
ah
but
there
is
she
said
quickly
last
night
you
were
very
kind
last
night
you
tried
to
help
me
i
seemed
to
see
her
again
standing
pale
and
troubled
while
my
father
watched
her
coldly
appraising
and
brutus
grinned
at
her
across
the
room
mademoiselle
i
began
anything
that
i
did
last
night
was
quite
unnecessary
she
said
and
very
foolish
i
drew
a
sharp
breath
the
bit
of
gallantry
i
had
on
my
mind
to
speak
seemed
weak
and
useless
now
mademoiselle
is
mistaken
i
lied
smoothly
nothing
that
i
did
last
night
was
on
her
account
nothing
she
exclaimed
sharply
i
do
not
understand
no
nothing
i
said
pray
believe
me
anything
i
did
however
foolish
was
solely
for
myself
i
have
my
own
affair
to
settle
with
my
father
bah
cried
mademoiselle
tapping
her
foot
on
the
floor
and
oddly
enough
my
reply
seemed
to
have
made
her
angry
so
you
are
like
all
the
rest
of
them
stupid
narrow
calculating
if
mademoiselle
will
only
listen
i
began
strangely
puzzled
and
singularly
contrite
listen
to
you
she
cried
no
monsieur
i
have
listened
to
you
quite
long
enough
to
know
your
type
i
see
now
you
are
quite
what
i
thought
you
would
be
i
say
you
are
entirely
ineffective
and
must
leave
your
father
alone
you
do
not
understand
him
you
do
not
even
know
him
with
me
it
is
different
i
have
seen
the
world
he
is
temperamental
your
father
a
genius
in
his
way
and
a
little
mad
perhaps
leave
him
to
me
monsieur
and
it
will
be
quite
all
right
last
night
it
was
so
sudden
that
i
was
frightened
for
a
moment
i
should
have
remembered
he
is
erratic
and
apt
to
change
his
mind
i
should
have
guessed
why
he
changed
it
it
is
you
monsieur
you
have
had
a
bad
effect
upon
him
you
have
made
him
turn
suddenly
grotesque
what
did
you
do
to
him
last
evening
do
to
him
i
asked
stupidly
enough
why
nothing
i
listened
to
him
mademoiselle
just
as
i
have
been
listening
to
him
all
this
morning
and
yet
she
said
it
is
your
fault
usually
he
is
most
well
behaved
he
is
moderate
monsieur
at
blanzy
a
glass
of
wine
at
dinner
was
all
he
ever
desired
for
days
at
a
time
i
have
hardly
heard
him
say
a
word
the
marquis
would
call
him
the
sphinx
and
what
has
he
been
doing
here
drinking
bottle
after
bottle
talking
steadily
acting
outrageously
what
is
more
he
has
been
doing
so
ever
since
he
spoke
of
returning
home
i
tell
you
monsieur
you
must
keep
away
from
him
or
perhaps
he
will
do
with
the
paper
exactly
what
he
says
pray
do
not
scowl
laugh
monsieur
it
is
funny
funny
i
exclaimed
as
stupidly
as
before
mademoiselle
sighed
if
the
marquis
had
only
lived
how
he
would
have
laughed
it
was
odd
the
sense
of
humor
of
the
marquis
strange
how
much
alike
they
were
the
marquis
and
your
father
it
is
pleasant
that
mademoiselle
and
i
should
have
something
in
common
i
said
her
gaze
grew
very
soft
and
far
away
not
as
much
as
they
had
we
never
shall
i
think
it
was
because
they
both
were
embittered
with
life
both
a
trifle
tired
and
cynical
my
father
thought
there
should
be
a
king
of
france
and
yet
i
think
he
knew
there
could
not
be
one
your
father
it
is
another
story
quite
i
agreed
and
yet
mademoiselle
will
pardon
me
i
fail
to
see
what
they
had
in
common
you
say
that
said
mademoiselle
because
you
do
not
know
him
as
well
as
i
do
do
you
not
see
that
he
is
a
bitter
disappointed
man
they
were
both
disappointed
i
examined
the
bolt
on
the
door
and
found
it
firm
despite
its
age
i
glanced
over
the
long
low
studded
room
and
moved
a
chair
from
the
center
to
a
place
nearer
the
wall
her
glance
followed
me
inquiringly
but
i
forestalled
her
question
mademoiselle
i
observed
was
pointing
out
that
she
found
something
droll
in
the
situation
and
is
it
not
droll
you
should
have
changed
him
she
inquired
and
yet
i
thought
she
looked
around
uneasily
you
have
monsieur
he
was
cautious
before
this
he
foresaw
everything
he
was
willing
to
risk
nothing
he
even
warned
the
marquis
against
attacking
the
coach
i
began
to
perceive
why
the
marquis
honored
my
father
with
his
friendship
was
attacking
coaches
a
frequent
habit
of
the
marquis
i
asked
has
he
not
told
you
she
exclaimed
raising
her
eyebrows
one
would
hardly
call
our
conversation
confidential
i
explained
is
that
what
you
find
so
droll
and
indeed
she
seemed
in
a
rare
good
humor
and
inexplicably
gay
a
curious
mona
lisa
smile
kept
bending
her
lips
and
twinkling
in
her
eyes
the
lowering
clouds
outside
the
creakings
of
the
beams
and
rafters
under
the
east
wind
nor
even
the
drab
gloom
of
her
surroundings
seemed
to
dampen
her
sudden
access
of
good
nature
the
events
she
had
witnessed
seemed
also
to
please
her
was
it
spite
that
had
made
her
smile
when
she
watched
my
father
and
his
visitors
was
it
spite
that
made
her
smile
now
as
she
gazed
at
the
room
battered
prosperity
and
at
my
portrait
above
the
mantlepiece
in
the
unruffled
dignity
of
its
blackening
oils
it
was
the
coach
said
mademoiselle
of
napoleon
at
montmareuil
a
dozen
of
them
set
upon
the
coach
the
lead
horses
were
killed
and
in
an
instant
they
were
at
the
doors
they
flung
them
open
but
he
was
not
inside
instead
the
coach
was
filled
with
the
consular
police
the
paper
the
paper
they
had
signed
was
at
blanzy
and
your
father
had
agreed
to
rescue
it
in
case
of
accident
he
would
not
leave
me
monsieur
and
he
would
not
destroy
the
paper
she
paused
and
regarded
me
with
a
frown
that
had
more
of
curiosity
in
it
than
displeasure
it
was
all
well
enough
she
added
until
he
heard
of
you
until
you
and
he
had
dinner
it
is
something
you
did
something
you
said
that
has
made
it
all
different
i
ask
you
what
have
you
done
to
him
he
was
our
friend
before
he
saw
you
or
why
would
he
have
ridden
through
half
of
france
with
napoleon
police
a
half
a
league
behind
him
why
did
he
risk
everything
to
bring
out
the
paper
when
he
might
have
burned
it
why
did
he
not
sell
it
there
he
might
have
done
so
half
a
dozen
times
why
does
he
wait
till
now
do
you
know
what
i
would
say
if
you
were
older
and
less
transparent
do
you
know
an
imperious
ringing
note
had
entered
into
her
voice
which
made
me
regard
her
with
a
sudden
doubt
about
her
was
the
same
charm
and
mystery
that
had
held
me
silent
and
curious
the
same
unnatural
assurance
and
cold
disregard
of
her
surroundings
but
her
eyes
had
grown
watchful
and
unfriendly
i
would
say
that
you
had
turned
him
against
us
and
if
you
had
mademoiselle
is
overwrought
i
said
she
tapped
her
foot
on
the
floor
impatiently
and
compressed
her
lips
i
am
never
overwrought
said
mademoiselle
it
is
a
luxury
my
family
has
not
been
allowed
for
many
years
i
say
your
father
was
an
honest
man
as
men
go
and
a
brave
one
too
and
that
you
have
changed
him
and
i
warn
you
to
leave
him
alone
in
the
future
you
do
not
know
him
or
how
to
deal
with
him
i
tell
you
his
trifling
about
the
paper
is
a
passing
phase
and
that
you
must
not
disturb
him
no
no
do
not
protest
i
know
well
enough
you
are
not
to
blame
you
must
leave
him
to
me
that
is
all
it
pains
me
not
to
do
as
mademoiselle
suggests
i
said
you
mean
you
will
not
she
flashed
back
at
me
angrily
i
mean
i
will
not
i
answered
with
sudden
heat
no
i
added
more
harshly
as
she
attempted
to
interrupt
now
you
will
listen
to
me
you
say
i
am
a
fool
you
say
i
can
do
nothing
against
him
perhaps
not
mademoiselle
but
what
i
see
is
this
i
see
you
in
a
dangerous
situation
through
no
fault
of
your
own
and
whether
you
wish
it
or
not
i
am
going
to
get
you
out
of
it
he
has
done
enough
mademoiselle
and
this
is
going
to
be
the
end
by
heaven
if
he
looks
at
you
again
but
you
said
she
interrupted
i
did
not
have
the
chance
to
continue
for
a
hand
was
trying
the
latch
of
the
door
and
then
a
sharp
knock
interrupted
me
my
father
was
standing
on
the
threshold
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
to
me
he
entered
and
proceeded
to
the
center
of
the
room
while
i
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
bolted
it
again
if
he
noticed
my
action
he
did
not
choose
to
comment
instead
he
continued
towards
the
chair
where
mademoiselle
was
seated
i
had
hoped
that
you
might
get
along
more
pleasantly
you
and
my
son
he
observed
surely
he
has
points
in
his
favor
youth
candor
even
a
certain
amount
of
breeding
you
have
been
hard
on
him
mademoiselle
take
my
word
for
it
he
is
to
blame
for
nothing
so
you
have
been
listening
she
said
as
doubtless
mademoiselle
expected
said
my
father
i
had
hoped
and
so
had
i
i
said
he
turned
and
faced
me
hoped
i
continued
raising
my
voice
that
you
might
enter
here
and
leave
your
servant
somewhere
else
i
have
wanted
to
have
a
quiet
talk
with
you
this
morning
if
he
noted
anything
unusual
in
my
request
he
did
not
show
it
not
so
much
as
by
a
flicker
of
an
eyelash
it
has
hardly
been
opportune
for
conversation
he
admitted
but
now
as
you
say
brutus
is
gone
he
is
out
to
receive
a
message
i
am
expecting
which
can
hardly
be
delivered
at
the
front
door
you
were
saying
doubtless
mademoiselle
will
pardon
us
mademoiselle
i
went
on
will
even
be
interested
i
have
wanted
to
speak
to
you
so
that
i
might
explain
myself
since
i
have
been
here
i
fear
i
have
been
impulsive
you
must
lay
it
to
my
youth
father
he
nodded
a
grave
assent
you
must
not
apologize
it
has
been
quite
refreshing
and
yet
i
am
not
so
young
i
am
can
it
be
possible
exclaimed
my
father
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
i
was
so
near
the
grave
i
came
to
see
you
here
i
continued
because
as
my
uncle
said
you
are
my
father
i
came
here
because
because
i
thought
i
paused
and
drew
a
deep
breath
and
my
father
smiled
why
i
came
is
aside
from
the
point
at
any
rate
i
said
indeed
yes
agreed
my
father
and
have
we
not
been
over
the
matter
before
if
you
had
accorded
me
one
serious
word
it
might
have
been
different
i
continued
but
instead
sir
you
have
seen
fit
to
jest
it
is
not
what
you
have
done
this
morning
sir
as
much
as
your
manner
towards
me
which
makes
me
take
this
step
that
you
have
brought
a
lady
from
france
and
robbed
her
that
you
have
robbed
my
uncle
and
have
threatened
to
fire
on
the
town
somehow
they
seem
no
particular
affair
of
mine
except
for
this
you
seem
to
think
that
i
am
incapable
of
doing
anything
to
hinder
you
and
frankly
sir
this
hurts
my
pride
you
feel
that
i
am
going
to
sit
by
passively
and
watch
you
i
came
a
step
nearer
but
he
did
not
draw
back
he
only
continued
watching
me
with
a
patient
intentness
which
seemed
gradually
to
merge
into
some
more
active
interest
his
interest
deepened
when
i
spoke
again
but
that
was
all
you
feel
i
am
going
to
be
still
and
do
nothing
even
after
you
drugged
me
last
evening
did
you
think
i
would
not
resent
it
you
are
mistaken
father
my
father
rubbed
his
chin
thoughtfully
i
had
not
thought
of
it
exactly
so
he
said
yet
i
had
to
keep
you
quiet
so
if
the
tables
were
turned
and
i
were
you
and
you
were
i
you
would
hardly
let
matters
go
on
without
joining
in
hardly
he
agreed
you
have
thought
the
matter
out
very
prettily
my
son
it
is
an
angle
i
seem
to
have
neglected
it
only
remains
to
ask
what
you
are
going
to
do
let
us
trust
it
will
be
nothing
stupid
i
am
glad
you
understand
i
said
because
now
it
will
be
perfectly
clear
why
i
am
asking
you
for
the
paper
and
you
will
appreciate
any
steps
i
may
take
to
get
it
he
cast
a
quick
glance
around
the
room
and
seemed
satisfied
that
we
were
quite
alone
do
i
understand
he
inquired
that
you
have
asked
me
for
the
paper
i
nodded
and
his
voice
grew
thoughtfully
gentle
you
interest
me
he
said
i
have
a
penchant
for
mysteries
may
i
ask
why
you
believe
i
shall
give
it
to
you
i
shall
try
to
show
you
i
said
and
tossed
aside
my
coat
and
drew
my
small
sword
he
stood
rigid
and
motionless
and
his
face
became
more
set
and
expressionless
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
but
before
he
could
speak
mademoiselle
had
sprung
between
us
you
fool
she
cried
put
up
your
sword
will
you
not
be
quiet
as
i
told
you
be
seated
mademoiselle
said
my
father
gently
where
are
your
senses
henry
can
you
not
manage
without
creating
a
scene
put
up
your
sword
i
can
not
draw
against
you
mademoiselle
paler
than
i
had
seen
her
before
sank
back
into
her
chair
i
am
sorry
you
find
yourself
unable
i
said
because
i
shall
attack
you
in
any
event
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
my
father
remonstrated
engage
me
with
a
small
sword
it
is
incredible
i
have
been
waiting
almost
twelve
hours
for
the
opportunity
i
replied
pray
put
yourself
on
guard
father
his
stony
look
of
repression
had
left
him
the
lines
about
his
mouth
relaxed
again
for
a
moment
i
thought
the
gaze
he
bent
upon
me
was
almost
kindly
then
he
sighed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
began
slowly
to
unwind
a
handkerchief
which
he
had
tied
about
his
right
hand
disclosing
several
cuts
on
his
knuckles
i
forgot
that
captain
tracy
might
have
teeth
he
said
positively
my
son
you
become
disappointing
i
had
given
you
credit
for
more
imagination
and
instead
you
think
you
can
match
your
sword
against
mine
pray
do
not
interrupt
mademoiselle
he
added
turning
to
her
with
a
bow
it
will
be
quite
nothing
and
we
have
neither
of
us
had
much
exercise
he
paused
and
carefully
divested
himself
of
his
coat
folding
it
neatly
and
placing
it
on
the
table
when
it
was
placed
to
advantage
he
drew
his
sword
and
tested
its
point
on
the
floor
who
knows
he
added
bending
the
blade
perhaps
we
may
have
sport
after
all
lawton
was
never
bad
with
the
foils
we
had
only
crossed
swords
long
enough
for
me
to
feel
the
supple
play
of
his
wrist
before
i
began
to
press
him
i
feinted
and
disengaged
and
a
second
later
i
had
lunged
over
his
guard
and
had
forced
him
to
give
back
mon
dieu
exclaimed
my
father
gaily
you
surprise
me
what
again
damn
these
chairs
a
fire
of
exultation
leapt
through
me
i
grinned
at
my
father
over
the
crossed
blades
for
i
could
read
something
in
his
face
that
steadied
my
hand
my
best
attack
might
leave
him
unscathed
but
i
was
doing
more
much
more
than
he
had
expected
i
lunged
again
and
again
he
stepped
back
thrusting
so
quickly
that
i
had
barely
time
to
recover
excellent
said
my
father
you
are
quick
my
son
you
even
have
an
eye
mademoiselle
i
called
sharply
the
paper
in
the
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
take
it
out
and
burn
it
good
god
exclaimed
my
father
you
see
i
said
i
have
my
points
my
son
he
said
parrying
the
thrust
with
which
i
ended
my
last
words
pray
accept
my
apologies
and
my
congratulations
you
have
a
better
mind
and
a
better
sword
than
i
could
reasonably
have
expected
indeed
you
quite
make
me
extend
myself
but
you
must
learn
to
recover
more
quickly
henry
much
more
quickly
i
have
seen
too
many
good
men
go
down
for
just
that
failing
it
may
be
well
enough
against
an
ordinary
swordsman
my
son
or
even
a
moderately
good
one
but
as
for
me
i
could
run
you
through
twice
over
indeed
i
would
if
the
paper
mademoiselle
i
called
again
have
you
got
it
exactly
said
my
father
the
paper
if
the
paper
were
in
my
pocket
you
my
son
would
now
be
in
the
surgeon
hands
the
paper
however
is
upstairs
in
my
volume
of
rabelais
and
now
his
wrist
suddenly
stiffened
he
made
a
feint
at
my
throat
and
in
the
same
motion
lowered
his
guard
as
i
came
on
parade
my
sword
was
wrenched
from
my
grasp
at
the
same
time
i
stepped
past
his
point
and
seized
him
around
the
waist
you
heard
mademoiselle
i
cried
the
door
and
we
fell
together
my
father
uttered
something
which
seemed
very
near
a
curse
and
clutched
at
my
throat
i
loosened
my
grasp
to
fend
away
his
hand
and
he
broke
away
from
my
other
arm
and
sprang
to
his
feet
just
as
he
did
so
there
was
a
blow
a
splintering
of
wood
the
door
was
carried
off
its
hinges
and
brutus
leapt
beside
him
the
floor
had
not
been
clean
my
father
brushed
regretfully
at
the
smudges
on
his
cambric
shirt
my
coat
if
you
please
mademoiselle
he
said
i
see
you
have
it
in
your
hands
gad
my
son
it
was
a
nearer
thing
than
i
expected
on
my
word
i
did
not
know
that
brutus
was
back
he
is
like
you
captain
said
mademoiselle
handing
the
coat
to
him
you
are
both
stubborn
for
some
reason
i
could
not
fathom
her
good
nature
had
returned
it
was
relief
perhaps
that
made
her
smile
at
us
it
is
a
family
trait
returned
my
father
as
though
kicking
down
the
door
had
been
a
simple
household
duty
brutus
turned
from
it
with
quiet
passivity
and
adjusted
the
folds
of
the
blue
broadcloth
with
an
equal
thoroughness
while
my
father
straightened
the
lace
at
his
wrists
huh
said
brutus
suddenly
then
i
noticed
that
his
stockings
were
caked
with
river
mud
and
that
he
had
evidently
been
running
my
father
forgetful
of
his
coat
for
the
moment
whirled
about
and
faced
him
to
think
i
had
forgotten
he
cried
what
news
you
black
rascal
huh
said
brutus
again
and
handed
him
a
spotted
slip
of
paper
my
father
lips
parted
he
seized
it
with
unusual
alacrity
read
it
and
tossed
it
in
the
fire
then
he
sighed
like
a
man
from
whose
mind
a
heavy
weight
of
care
has
been
lifted
the
tenseness
seemed
to
leave
his
slim
figure
and
for
an
instant
he
looked
as
though
the
day
had
tired
him
and
as
though
another
crisis
were
over
he
there
he
demanded
sharply
huh
said
brutus
now
heaven
be
praised
for
that
said
my
father
with
something
that
was
a
close
approach
to
fervor
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
if
perhaps
something
had
happened
mademoiselle
looked
up
at
him
demurely
the
captain
has
good
news
she
asked
he
turned
to
her
and
smiled
his
blandest
smile
under
the
circumstances
he
said
the
best
i
could
expect
still
smiling
he
smoothed
his
coat
and
squared
his
shoulders
our
little
melodrama
my
lady
is
drawing
to
its
close
xi
the
sun
had
finally
broken
through
the
clouds
and
already
its
rays
were
slanting
into
the
room
falling
softly
on
the
dusty
furniture
and
making
the
shadows
of
the
vines
outside
dance
fitfully
on
the
wall
by
the
fire
and
the
shadows
of
the
elms
were
growing
long
and
straight
over
the
rain
soaked
leaves
and
the
rank
damp
grass
of
our
lawn
it
was
the
dull
gentle
sunshine
of
an
autumn
afternoon
soft
and
kindly
and
yet
a
little
bleak
yes
said
my
father
it
is
nearly
over
it
turns
into
a
simple
matter
after
all
i
wonder
mademoiselle
will
you
be
sorry
will
you
ever
recall
our
weeks
on
the
i
shall
i
think
and
the
inn
in
britanny
with
brutus
up
the
road
and
ned
aiken
swearing
at
the
post
boys
at
least
we
were
living
life
and
the
i
told
you
they
would
never
beat
us
on
a
windward
tack
i
told
you
mademoiselle
the
majority
of
mankind
were
very
simple
people
and
you
still
feel
so
she
asked
him
now
more
than
ever
said
my
father
i
had
almost
hoped
there
would
be
one
sane
man
among
the
dozens
outside
but
they
all
have
the
brains
of
school
boys
no
wonder
the
world
moves
so
slowly
and
great
men
seem
so
great
and
he
wound
the
handkerchief
around
his
hand
again
the
captain
has
arranged
to
sell
the
paper
asked
mademoiselle
exactly
said
my
father
the
price
has
been
fixed
and
i
shall
deliver
it
myself
as
soon
as
the
day
grows
a
little
darker
i
am
sorry
almost
it
has
not
been
uninteresting
no
said
mademoiselle
it
has
not
been
uninteresting
you
are
pale
my
son
said
my
father
turning
to
me
i
trust
you
are
not
hurt
i
shook
my
head
it
is
only
your
pride
you
will
be
better
soon
come
we
have
always
been
good
losers
we
have
always
known
when
the
game
was
up
let
us
see
if
we
can
not
end
it
gracefully
as
gentlemen
should
you
can
not
get
the
paper
why
not
make
the
best
of
it
you
have
tried
and
tried
not
unskilfully
but
you
see
now
that
the
right
man
can
not
always
win
a
useful
lesson
is
it
not
i
do
not
ask
you
to
like
me
for
it
you
have
seen
enough
of
me
i
hope
to
hate
me
and
yet
let
us
be
philosophical
be
seated
my
son
brutus
it
is
three
bring
in
the
madeira
and
the
noon
meal
i
did
not
reply
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
watching
me
narrowly
brutus
threw
another
log
on
the
fire
which
gave
off
a
brisk
crackling
from
the
bed
of
coals
he
then
stood
waiting
doubtfully
until
my
father
nodded
take
the
door
out
as
you
go
my
father
directed
mademoiselle
permit
me
he
pointed
out
an
armchair
beside
the
fire
and
you
my
son
opposite
so
from
the
side
pocket
of
his
coat
he
drew
a
silver
mounted
pistol
which
he
examined
with
studious
attention
come
he
said
slipping
it
back
let
us
be
tranquil
is
there
any
reason
to
bear
ill
will
simply
because
we
each
stand
on
an
opposite
side
of
a
question
of
ethics
if
you
had
only
been
to
the
wars
how
differently
you
would
see
it
there
hundreds
of
men
stab
each
other
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
none
of
the
crudeness
of
personal
animosity
only
the
best
of
good
nature
in
a
little
time
now
we
shall
part
never
if
i
can
help
it
to
meet
again
you
have
seen
me
as
a
dangerous
reckless
man
without
any
principles
worth
mentioning
indeed
i
have
so
few
that
i
shall
have
recourse
to
violence
my
son
if
you
do
not
assume
a
more
reposeful
manner
the
evening
will
be
active
enough
to
make
any
further
excitement
quite
superfluous
have
patience
an
hour
or
so
means
little
to
anyone
so
young
there
fell
a
silence
while
he
stood
immovably
watching
us
a
gust
of
wind
blew
down
the
chimney
and
scattered
a
cloud
of
dust
over
the
hearth
the
rafters
creaked
somewhere
in
the
stillness
a
door
slammed
the
very
lack
of
expression
in
his
face
was
stamping
it
on
my
memory
and
for
the
first
time
its
phlegmatic
calm
aroused
in
me
a
new
emotion
i
had
hated
it
and
wondered
at
it
before
and
now
in
spite
of
myself
it
was
giving
me
a
twinge
of
pity
for
nature
had
intended
it
to
be
an
expressive
face
sensitive
and
quick
to
mirror
each
perception
and
emotion
was
it
pride
that
had
turned
it
into
a
mask
and
drawn
a
curtain
before
the
light
that
burned
within
or
had
the
light
burned
out
and
left
it
merely
cold
and
unresponsive
the
captain
is
thinking
said
mademoiselle
he
smiled
and
fixed
her
with
his
level
glance
indeed
yes
he
answered
briskly
it
is
a
rudeness
for
which
i
can
only
crave
your
pardon
strange
that
i
should
have
tasted
your
hospitality
so
often
and
should
still
be
a
taciturn
host
mademoiselle
bit
her
lip
there
is
only
one
thing
stranger
she
said
coldly
and
that
is
said
my
father
bending
toward
her
attentively
that
you
should
betray
the
last
request
of
the
man
who
once
sheltered
you
and
trusted
you
and
showed
you
every
kindness
tell
me
captain
is
it
another
display
of
artistic
temperament
or
simply
a
lack
of
breeding
her
words
seemed
to
fall
lightly
on
my
father
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
waved
his
hand
in
an
airy
gesture
of
denial
bah
he
said
if
the
marquis
were
alive
he
would
understand
he
was
always
an
opportunist
the
marquis
your
wine
he
would
say
your
wine
and
break
your
glass
we
may
not
have
heads
to
drink
it
with
tomorrow
i
am
merely
drinking
the
wine
mademoiselle
he
would
not
blame
me
besides
the
marquis
owes
me
nothing
if
it
were
not
for
me
your
brother
would
be
drinking
his
wine
in
paradise
instead
of
cursing
at
the
american
climate
and
you
mademoiselle
would
you
have
preferred
to
remain
with
the
police
he
looked
thoughtfully
into
his
snuff
box
dead
men
press
no
bills
surely
you
recall
the
marquis
said
that
also
no
mademoiselle
we
must
be
practical
to
live
the
marquis
would
understand
the
marquis
was
always
practical
she
caught
her
breath
sharply
but
my
father
seemed
not
to
have
perceived
the
effect
of
his
words
ah
he
said
here
is
brutus
with
the
meal
brutus
had
carried
in
a
small
round
table
on
which
were
arranged
a
loaf
of
bread
and
some
salt
meat
mademoiselle
will
join
me
asked
my
father
rubbing
his
hands
i
do
not
think
he
expected
her
reply
any
more
than
i
did
indeed
it
seemed
to
give
him
a
momentary
uneasiness
one
must
eat
said
mademoiselle
we
will
eat
captain
and
then
we
will
talk
i
am
sorry
you
have
made
it
necessary
but
of
course
you
have
expected
it
mademoiselle
has
been
unnaturally
subdued
he
replied
it
is
pleasant
she
is
coming
to
herself
again
and
you
my
son
you
should
be
hungry
as
mademoiselle
says
one
must
eat
i
answered
good
he
said
the
food
is
poor
but
you
will
find
the
wine
excellent
and
he
filled
the
glasses
it
was
a
strange
meal
now
we
shall
talk
said
mademoiselle
when
it
was
finished
my
father
raised
his
wine
glass
to
the
light
it
is
always
a
pleasure
to
listen
to
mademoiselle
i
fear
replied
mademoiselle
that
this
will
be
the
exception
impossible
said
my
father
sipping
his
wine
all
this
morning
i
have
tried
to
have
a
word
with
you
said
mademoiselle
but
your
time
has
been
well
taken
up
i
hoped
to
speak
to
you
instead
of
your
son
but
he
failed
to
take
my
advice
and
remain
quiet
as
i
said
before
you
are
both
stubborn
not
that
it
has
made
much
difference
you
still
have
the
paper
she
caused
and
surveyed
him
calmly
is
it
not
painful
to
continue
the
discussion
my
father
inquired
i
assure
you
i
have
not
changed
my
mind
since
last
evening
nor
shall
i
change
it
must
i
repeat
that
the
affair
of
the
paper
is
finished
we
shall
see
said
mademoiselle
as
mademoiselle
wishes
said
my
father
it
has
been
six
years
since
i
first
saw
you
in
paris
said
mademoiselle
her
voice
was
softly
musical
and
somehow
she
was
no
longer
cold
and
forbidding
my
father
placed
his
wine
glass
on
the
table
and
seemingly
a
little
disturbed
gave
her
his
full
attention
six
years
said
mademoiselle
i
have
often
thought
of
you
since
then
you
have
done
me
too
much
honor
said
my
father
you
always
have
my
lady
she
only
smiled
and
shook
her
head
you
are
the
sort
of
man
whom
women
think
about
and
the
sort
whom
women
admire
surely
you
know
that
without
my
telling
you
a
man
with
a
past
is
always
more
pleasant
than
one
with
a
future
do
you
know
what
i
thought
when
i
saw
you
that
evening
you
remember
they
were
in
the
room
whispering
as
usual
plotting
and
planning
and
you
were
to
have
a
boat
off
the
coast
of
normandy
you
and
the
marquis
had
ridden
from
bordeaux
i
thought
captain
that
you
were
the
sort
of
man
who
could
succeed
in
anything
you
tried
yes
anything
perhaps
you
know
the
marquis
thought
so
too
and
even
today
i
believe
we
were
nearly
right
we
saw
you
in
brussels
later
and
in
holland
and
then
at
blanzy
this
year
i
have
known
of
a
dozen
commissions
you
have
performed
without
a
single
blunder
indeed
i
know
of
only
one
thing
in
which
you
have
definitely
failed
only
one
impossible
said
my
father
yes
only
one
and
it
seemed
simple
enough
a
touch
of
color
had
mounted
to
her
cheeks
and
she
looked
down
at
the
bare
table
you
have
done
your
best
done
your
best
in
a
hundred
little
ways
to
make
me
hate
you
you
have
studied
the
matter
carefully
as
you
study
everything
you
have
missed
few
opportunities
even
a
minute
ago
about
the
marquis
and
yet
you
have
not
succeeded
my
father
raised
his
hand
hastily
to
his
coat
lapel
is
there
never
a
woman
who
will
not
reduce
matters
to
personalities
he
murmured
i
should
have
known
better
i
see
it
now
i
should
have
made
love
to
you
though
her
voice
was
grave
there
was
laughter
in
her
eyes
i
have
often
wondered
why
you
did
not
it
was
the
only
method
you
seem
to
have
overlooked
there
is
one
mistake
a
man
always
makes
about
women
he
smiled
and
glanced
at
us
both
and
then
back
at
his
wine
again
he
forgets
they
are
all
alike
sooner
or
later
he
sees
one
that
in
some
strange
way
seems
different
i
thought
you
were
different
mademoiselle
heaven
forgive
me
i
thought
you
even
rational
surely
you
have
every
reason
to
dislike
me
let
us
be
serious
mademoiselle
you
do
not
hate
me
i
am
afraid
said
mademoiselle
that
you
have
had
quite
an
opposite
effect
in
spite
of
myself
i
started
could
it
be
that
i
was
jealous
her
eyes
were
lowered
to
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
she
was
intent
on
the
delicate
carving
of
the
mahogany
it
was
true
then
i
might
have
suspected
it
before
but
was
it
possible
that
i
cared
good
god
exclaimed
my
father
and
pushed
back
his
chair
mademoiselle
rested
her
chin
on
the
palm
of
her
hand
i
told
you
the
interview
would
not
be
pleasant
she
said
but
you
are
pessimistic
captain
i
have
not
said
i
loved
you
do
not
be
alarmed
i
was
going
to
say
i
pitied
you
that
was
all
mon
dieu
my
father
murmured
it
is
worse
and
yet
i
thought
i
detected
a
note
of
relief
in
his
voice
surely
i
am
not
as
old
as
that
mademoiselle
whose
eyes
had
never
left
his
face
smiled
and
shook
her
head
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
she
said
no
no
captain
it
is
not
the
beginning
of
a
melodramatic
speech
i
am
not
offering
pity
to
the
villain
in
the
story
even
the
first
night
i
met
you
i
was
sorry
for
you
captain
i
was
sorry
as
soon
as
i
saw
your
eyes
i
knew
then
that
something
had
happened
and
when
i
heard
you
speak
i
told
myself
you
were
not
to
blame
for
it
i
still
believe
you
were
not
to
blame
you
see
i
know
your
story
now
indeed
said
my
father
and
you
still
are
sorry
mademoiselle
you
disappoint
me
yes
said
mademoiselle
i
heard
the
story
and
i
believe
she
was
to
blame
not
you
after
all
she
took
you
for
better
or
worse
and
then
a
strange
thing
happened
in
spite
of
himself
he
started
his
race
flushed
and
his
lips
pressed
tight
together
it
seemed
almost
as
though
a
spasm
of
pain
had
seized
him
which
he
could
not
conceal
in
spite
of
his
best
efforts
with
an
unconscious
motion
he
grasped
his
wine
glass
and
the
color
ebbed
from
his
cheeks
mademoiselle
is
mistaken
said
my
father
another
wine
glass
brutus
the
stem
of
the
one
he
was
holding
had
snapped
in
his
hand
nonsense
said
mademoiselle
shortly
my
father
cleared
his
throat
and
glanced
restlessly
away
his
face
still
set
and
still
lined
with
the
trace
of
suffering
mademoiselle
he
said
finally
you
deal
with
a
subject
which
is
still
painful
pray
excuse
me
if
i
do
not
discuss
it
anything
which
you
may
have
heard
of
my
affairs
is
entirely
a
fault
of
mine
you
understand
yes
said
mademoiselle
i
understand
and
we
shall
continue
to
discuss
it
no
matter
how
painful
it
is
to
you
who
knows
captain
perhaps
i
can
bring
you
to
your
senses
or
are
you
going
to
continue
to
ruin
your
life
on
account
of
a
woman
be
silent
mademoiselle
said
my
father
sharply
but
she
disregarded
his
interruption
so
she
believed
that
you
had
filled
your
ship
with
fifty
bales
of
shavings
she
believed
it
and
called
you
a
thief
she
believed
you
were
as
gauche
as
that
i
can
guess
the
rest
of
the
story
but
my
father
had
regained
his
equanimity
five
hundred
bales
of
shavings
he
corrected
you
are
misinformed
even
about
the
merest
details
and
for
fifteen
years
you
have
been
roving
about
the
world
trying
to
convince
her
she
was
right
ah
you
are
touched
i
have
guessed
your
secret
can
anything
be
more
ridiculous
he
half
started
from
his
chair
and
again
his
face
grew
drawn
and
haggard
she
right
he
said
a
little
hoarsely
believe
me
she
was
always
right
mademoiselle
nonsense
said
mademoiselle
i
do
not
believe
it
my
father
turned
to
me
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
it
is
pleasant
to
remember
is
it
not
my
son
that
your
mother
had
a
keener
discernment
and
did
not
give
way
to
the
dictates
of
a
romantic
imagination
sir
i
said
there
is
only
one
reason
why
i
ever
came
here
and
that
was
because
my
mother
requested
it
she
wanted
you
to
know
sir
that
she
regretted
what
she
said
almost
the
moment
you
left
the
house
if
you
had
ever
written
her
if
you
had
ever
sent
a
single
word
you
could
have
changed
it
all
in
spite
of
all
the
evidence
she
never
came
fully
to
believe
it
ah
but
you
believe
it
said
my
father
quickly
i
do
not
think
he
ever
heard
my
answer
he
had
turned
unsteadily
in
his
chair
and
was
facing
the
dying
embers
of
the
fire
his
left
hand
limp
on
the
table
before
him
again
the
spasm
of
pain
crossed
his
face
mademoiselle
still
watched
him
but
without
a
trace
of
triumph
indeed
she
seemed
more
kindly
and
more
gentle
than
i
had
ever
known
her
five
hundred
bales
of
shavings
she
softly
ah
captain
there
are
not
many
men
who
would
do
it
not
any
that
i
know
save
you
and
the
marquis
brutus
said
my
father
a
glass
of
rum
with
his
eyes
still
on
the
fire
he
drank
the
spirits
and
sighed
and
now
brutus
he
continued
my
volume
of
rabelais
but
when
it
was
placed
beside
him
he
left
it
unopened
and
still
continued
to
study
the
shifting
scenes
in
the
coals
xii
was
it
possible
that
i
cared
there
she
was
leaning
toward
him
the
flames
from
the
fire
dancing
softly
before
her
face
giving
her
dark
hair
a
hundred
new
lights
and
shadows
her
lips
were
parted
and
in
her
eyes
was
silent
entreaty
i
felt
a
sudden
unaccountable
impulse
to
snatch
up
the
volume
of
rabelais
to
face
my
father
again
weapon
or
no
weapon
to
show
her
come
captain
said
mademoiselle
gently
must
you
continue
this
after
it
has
turned
into
a
farce
must
you
continue
acting
from
pique
when
the
thing
has
been
over
for
more
years
than
you
care
to
remember
must
you
keep
on
now
because
of
a
whim
to
make
your
life
miserable
and
the
lives
of
others
will
you
threaten
fifty
men
with
death
and
ruin
because
you
once
were
called
a
thief
it
is
folly
sir
and
you
know
it
utter
useless
folly
pray
do
not
stare
at
me
it
was
easy
enough
to
piece
your
story
together
i
guessed
it
long
ago
i
have
listened
too
often
to
you
and
the
marquis
at
wine
come
captain
give
me
back
the
paper
with
his
old
half
smile
my
father
turned
to
her
and
nodded
in
pleasant
acknowledgment
mademoiselle
he
observed
evenly
i
have
gone
further
through
the
world
than
most
men
though
to
less
purpose
and
i
have
met
many
people
but
none
of
them
with
an
intuition
like
yours
he
paused
long
enough
to
refill
his
glass
you
are
right
mademoiselle
indeed
it
is
quite
wonderful
to
meet
a
woman
of
your
discernment
yes
you
are
right
my
wife
called
me
a
rogue
and
a
scoundrel
mind
you
i
am
not
saying
she
was
mistaken
but
my
temper
was
hotter
then
than
it
is
now
i
have
done
my
best
to
convince
her
she
was
not
in
error
and
now
mademoiselle
it
has
become
as
much
of
a
habit
with
me
as
strong
drink
a
habit
which
even
you
can
not
break
i
have
been
a
villain
too
long
to
leave
off
lightly
no
mademoiselle
i
have
the
paper
and
i
intend
to
dispose
of
it
as
i
see
fit
your
mother
my
son
need
have
had
no
cause
for
regret
she
was
right
in
everything
she
said
brutus
tell
aiken
i
am
ready
to
see
him
he
must
have
been
in
the
hall
outside
for
he
entered
the
morning
room
almost
as
soon
as
my
father
had
spoken
dressed
in
his
rusty
black
sea
cloak
at
the
sight
of
mademoiselle
he
bowed
ceremoniously
and
blew
loudly
on
his
fingers
wind
shifted
southwest
he
said
but
we
ready
to
put
out
sit
down
aiken
said
my
father
my
son
pour
him
a
little
refreshment
ah
said
aiken
selecting
a
chair
by
the
fire
pour
it
out
my
lad
fill
her
up
it
a
short
life
and
little
joy
we
draw
it
from
the
bottle
and
long
life
and
much
joy
to
you
sir
by
the
same
token
he
added
raising
his
glass
and
tossing
the
spirits
adroitly
down
his
throat
then
with
a
comfortable
sigh
he
drew
out
his
pipe
and
lighted
it
on
an
ember
yes
she
be
blowing
before
morning
you
do
mean
inquired
my
father
with
a
glance
out
of
the
window
that
i
ca
launch
a
small
boat
from
the
beach
you
could
captain
if
you
a
mind
to
said
ned
aiken
tamping
down
his
tobacco
but
there
lots
who
could
then
i
shall
said
my
father
languidly
brutus
and
i
will
board
the
at
eight
tonight
you
will
stand
off
outside
and
put
on
your
running
lights
yes
said
aiken
it
time
we
was
going
you
mean
they
are
taking
steps
a
frigate
due
in
at
midnight
said
aiken
grinning
a
frigate
think
of
that
said
my
father
at
last
we
seem
to
be
making
our
mark
on
the
world
we
never
done
the
beat
of
this
said
aiken
and
everything
is
quiet
outside
all
right
so
far
said
aiken
how
many
men
are
watching
the
house
there
four
sir
he
answered
ah
said
my
father
and
lawton
still
stops
at
the
tavern
has
showed
his
head
all
morning
answered
aiken
ah
said
my
father
perhaps
he
is
right
in
concealing
such
a
useless
member
and
he
helped
himself
from
the
decanter
seemed
to
hesitate
for
a
moment
and
continued
and
jason
hill
he
has
been
to
call
ned
have
you
seen
him
since
he
been
walking
out
in
the
road
sir
all
morning
replied
aiken
and
a
schooner
of
his
is
anchored
upstream
and
if
you
pardon
the
liberty
i
do
give
that
for
jason
hill
and
he
spat
into
the
fire
it
may
please
you
to
know
said
my
father
that
i
quite
agree
with
you
i
am
afraid
he
went
on
looking
at
the
back
of
his
hand
that
jason
does
not
take
me
seriously
i
fear
he
will
find
he
is
wrong
brutus
brutus
apparently
anticipating
something
pleasant
moved
towards
my
father
chair
my
pistols
brutus
and
it
is
growing
dark
you
had
best
draw
the
shutters
and
bring
in
the
candles
we
sailing
very
close
to
the
wind
this
evening
listen
to
me
carefully
brutus
you
will
have
the
cutter
by
the
bar
at
eight
and
in
five
minutes
you
will
bring
out
my
horse
what
the
horse
for
asked
aiken
my
father
settled
himself
back
more
comfortably
in
his
chair
before
he
answered
a
few
drops
of
wine
had
spilled
on
the
mahogany
he
touched
them
and
held
up
his
fingers
and
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
stain
because
i
propose
to
ride
through
them
he
said
i
propose
showing
our
friends
how
shall
i
put
it
so
you
understand
that
i
do
care
a
damn
for
the
whole
pack
gad
murmured
aiken
i
might
have
known
it
and
here
i
was
thinking
you
be
quiet
and
sensible
are
you
still
going
on
with
that
damned
paper
the
red
of
the
wine
seemed
to
please
my
father
he
dipped
his
fingers
in
it
again
and
drew
them
slowly
across
the
back
of
his
left
hand
precisely
he
said
i
propose
to
deliver
it
tonight
before
i
sail
i
leave
it
at
hixon
farm
he
dead
said
aiken
exactly
said
my
father
only
his
shade
will
help
me
perhaps
it
will
be
enough
who
knows
there
be
half
a
dozen
after
you
before
you
get
through
the
gate
said
aiken
dubiously
you
can
lay
to
it
lawton
will
be
there
before
you
make
a
turn
that
said
my
father
is
why
i
say
we
sailing
very
close
to
the
wind
good
god
sir
burn
it
up
said
aiken
plaintively
what
it
been
doing
but
causing
trouble
ever
since
we
got
it
running
gear
carried
away
man
wounded
from
splinters
hell
to
pay
everywhere
gad
sir
they
afraid
to
sleep
tonight
for
fear
you
blow
out
of
bed
what
the
use
of
it
all
damn
it
that
what
i
say
what
the
use
and
now
here
you
go
risking
getting
a
piece
of
lead
thrown
in
you
all
because
of
a
few
names
scrawled
on
a
piece
of
paper
here
it
the
first
time
you
been
back
it
a
hell
of
a
that
what
i
say
i
told
you
you
had
ought
to
have
come
now
there
the
fire
why
not
forget
it
and
burn
it
up
and
then
it
over
just
as
neat
as
neat
and
then
we
aboard
and
after
the
pearls
again
why
what
must
the
boy
be
thinking
of
all
this
he
must
be
thinking
he
got
a
for
a
father
that
what
he
must
be
thinking
that
will
do
said
my
father
coldly
and
he
rose
slowly
from
his
chair
and
stood
squarely
in
front
of
me
tie
that
boy
up
brutus
he
commanded
it
is
a
compliment
my
son
my
opinion
of
you
is
steadily
rising
tie
him
up
brutus
you
will
find
a
rope
on
the
chimney
piece
he
stood
close
to
me
evidently
pleased
at
the
convulsive
anger
which
had
gripped
me
brutus
was
still
fumbling
on
the
mantlepiece
ned
pipe
had
dropped
from
his
mouth
it
was
mademoiselle
who
was
the
first
to
intervene
are
you
out
of
your
senses
she
demanded
seizing
him
by
the
arm
it
is
too
much
captain
i
tell
you
it
is
too
much
think
what
you
are
doing
and
send
the
black
man
off
i
have
been
thinking
the
matter
over
for
some
time
replied
my
father
tranquilly
and
i
have
determined
to
do
the
thing
thoroughly
if
he
can
not
like
me
it
is
better
for
him
to
hate
me
and
may
save
trouble
tie
him
up
brutus
bear
away
cried
aiken
harshly
mind
yourself
sir
his
warning
however
was
late
in
coming
i
had
sprung
at
my
father
before
the
sentence
was
finished
it
was
almost
the
only
time
i
knew
him
to
miscalculate
he
must
have
been
taken
unaware
for
he
stepped
backward
too
quickly
and
collided
with
the
very
chair
he
had
quitted
it
shook
his
balance
for
the
moment
so
that
he
thrust
a
hand
behind
him
to
recover
himself
and
in
the
same
instant
i
had
the
volume
of
rabelais
i
leapt
for
the
open
doorway
but
ned
aiken
was
there
to
intercept
me
brutus
was
up
behind
me
with
his
great
hands
clamping
down
on
my
shoulders
i
turned
and
hurled
the
volume
in
the
fireplace
my
father
caught
it
out
almost
before
it
landed
with
all
the
deliberation
of
a
connoisseur
examining
an
old
and
rare
edition
he
turned
the
pages
with
his
slim
fingers
there
as
he
had
said
was
the
paper
with
the
same
red
seals
that
i
had
admired
the
previous
evening
he
placed
it
slowly
in
his
inside
pocket
and
tossed
the
book
on
the
floor
now
here
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
said
aiken
my
father
was
watching
me
thoughtfully
take
your
hands
off
him
brutus
he
said
and
bring
out
the
horse
for
a
second
longer
we
stood
motionless
each
watching
the
other
then
my
father
crossed
to
the
long
table
near
which
i
was
standing
picked
up
the
pistols
that
brutus
had
left
there
and
slipped
them
into
his
capacious
side
pockets
you
disappoint
me
henry
he
remarked
you
should
have
used
those
pistols
i
had
thought
of
them
i
answered
i
am
glad
of
that
he
said
it
is
a
relief
to
know
you
did
not
overlook
them
you
were
right
mademoiselle
i
should
have
known
better
than
to
treat
him
so
we
have
ceased
to
play
the
game
my
son
it
only
remains
to
take
my
leave
i
shall
not
trouble
you
again
he
was
standing
close
beside
me
was
it
possible
his
eyes
were
a
little
wistful
and
his
voice
a
trifle
sad
i
thought
i
should
be
glad
to
leave
you
he
said
and
somehow
i
am
sorry
odd
that
we
can
never
properly
gauge
our
emotions
i
feel
that
you
will
be
a
very
blithe
and
active
gentleman
in
time
and
there
are
not
so
many
left
in
these
drab
days
ah
well
his
sword
was
lying
on
the
table
he
drew
it
and
tucked
the
naked
blade
under
his
arm
in
spite
of
the
two
candles
which
brutus
had
left
the
shadows
had
closed
about
us
so
that
his
figure
alone
remained
distinct
in
the
yellow
light
slender
and
carelessly
elegant
i
think
it
pleased
him
to
have
us
all
three
watching
any
gathering
however
small
that
he
might
dominate
appeared
to
give
him
enjoyment
his
leave
taking
not
less
than
the
others
it
is
growing
dark
aiken
he
observed
and
our
position
is
not
without
its
drawbacks
call
in
the
men
from
outside
and
take
them
aboard
and
give
them
a
measure
of
rum
no
one
will
disturb
me
before
i
leave
i
think
you
had
better
weigh
at
once
and
never
mind
your
running
lights
till
it
is
time
for
them
so
you
going
to
do
it
said
aiken
i
might
have
known
you
would
listen
to
reason
you
should
have
sailed
with
me
long
enough
said
my
father
to
know
i
never
do
and
you
not
even
dressed
for
it
added
aiken
you
might
be
going
to
a
party
so
you
might
i
think
replied
my
father
the
evening
will
be
more
interesting
than
a
purely
social
affair
keep
the
well
off
and
we
shall
meet
only
too
soon
again
why
do
i
take
the
boy
along
aiken
suggested
eyeing
me
a
little
furtively
he
be
right
useful
where
we
going
and
the
sea
would
do
him
good
so
it
would
i
fancy
you
have
enough
bother
without
him
replied
my
father
personally
i
have
found
him
quite
distracting
during
my
short
visit
hell
said
aiken
he
would
be
no
trouble
but
he
looks
fair
ugly
here
so
he
does
and
he
knows
too
much
no
offense
sir
but
too
up
and
coming
to
be
left
alone
with
an
ignorant
nigger
my
father
shrugged
his
shoulders
brutus
is
fond
of
the
boy
he
will
not
hurt
him
but
the
boy
might
hurt
the
nigger
said
aiken
my
father
nodded
blandly
toward
the
hall
and
you
might
be
seasick
he
said
har
roared
aiken
seemingly
struck
by
the
subtle
humor
of
the
remark
damned
if
you
would
joke
if
the
deck
was
blowing
off
under
you
damned
if
i
ever
seen
the
likes
of
you
now
captain
still
under
the
spell
of
mirth
he
left
us
the
house
door
closed
behind
him
and
brutus
glided
into
the
room
mademoiselle
said
my
father
bowing
i
am
sorry
the
cards
have
fallen
so
we
must
part
if
you
had
as
few
pleasant
things
as
i
to
remember
you
also
might
understand
how
poignantly
i
regret
it
even
though
i
know
it
is
for
the
best
it
is
time
you
were
leaving
such
low
company
i
have
found
it
pleasant
sometimes
she
replied
a
little
wistfully
it
takes
very
little
to
please
me
captain
sometimes
he
replied
smiling
anything
is
pleasant
but
only
sometimes
your
brother
has
been
notified
mademoiselle
you
should
hear
from
him
in
a
little
while
now
when
this
hurry
and
bustle
is
over
and
when
you
see
him
give
him
my
regards
and
my
regrets
and
mademoiselle
he
hesitated
an
instant
would
you
think
it
insolent
if
i
said
i
sometimes
wished
mon
dieu
mademoiselle
do
not
take
it
so
it
was
entirely
unpardonable
of
me
mademoiselle
had
hidden
her
face
in
her
hands
my
father
frowning
slightly
rubbed
his
thumb
along
his
sword
blade
forgive
me
if
you
can
he
said
i
have
often
feared
my
manners
would
fail
me
sometime
she
looked
up
at
him
then
and
her
eyes
were
very
bright
suppose
she
said
softly
i
told
you
there
was
nothing
to
forgive
suppose
i
said
my
father
bowing
his
lowest
politely
and
rather
hastily
interrupted
mademoiselle
would
be
too
kind
she
would
have
forgotten
that
it
is
quite
impossible
no
said
mademoiselle
shaking
her
head
slowly
it
is
not
impossible
you
should
have
known
better
than
to
say
that
suppose
her
voice
choked
a
little
as
though
the
words
hurt
her
suppose
i
bade
you
recall
captain
what
you
said
on
the
stairs
at
blanzy
when
they
were
at
the
door
and
you
were
going
to
meet
them
do
you
remember
my
father
smiled
and
made
a
polite
little
gesture
of
assumed
despair
then
his
voice
very
slow
and
cool
broke
in
on
her
speech
and
stilled
it
good
god
mademoiselle
one
can
not
remember
everything
playing
with
the
hilt
of
his
sword
he
stepped
nearer
still
smiling
still
watching
her
with
a
polished
curiosity
i
have
said
so
many
little
things
to
women
in
my
time
so
many
little
nothings
it
is
hard
to
remember
them
all
they
have
become
confused
now
and
blended
into
an
interesting
background
whose
elements
i
can
no
longer
separate
your
pardon
my
lady
but
i
have
forgotten
forgotten
so
completely
that
even
the
stairs
seem
merely
a
gentle
blur
and
he
pressed
his
hand
over
his
brow
and
sighed
while
he
watched
her
face
flush
crimson
you
lie
she
cried
you
have
not
forgotten
my
father
ceased
to
smile
and
suppose
i
have
not
he
said
what
is
it
to
mademoiselle
what
are
the
words
of
a
ruined
man
the
idle
speech
of
a
fool
who
fancied
he
would
sup
that
night
in
paradise
and
what
use
is
it
to
recall
them
now
is
it
possible
you
believe
i
am
touched
by
such
trivial
matters
because
everyone
had
done
what
you
wish
do
you
think
i
shall
also
do
you
think
you
can
make
me
give
up
the
paper
as
though
i
were
a
simpering
romantic
fool
in
paris
do
you
think
i
have
gone
this
far
to
turn
back
mademoiselle
seems
to
forget
that
i
have
the
game
in
my
own
hands
it
would
be
a
foolish
thing
to
throw
it
all
away
even
he
paused
and
bowed
again
even
for
you
mademoiselle
i
have
arrived
where
i
am
today
only
for
one
reason
can
you
not
guess
it
it
was
a
pleasure
to
take
you
from
blanzy
it
is
business
now
and
they
can
not
be
combined
listen
mademoiselle
he
continued
not
three
miles
off
the
harbor
mouth
is
a
french
ship
tacking
back
and
forth
and
not
entirely
for
pleasure
around
this
house
at
present
are
enough
men
to
run
your
estates
at
blanzy
a
sloop
has
come
into
the
harbor
this
morning
and
has
landed
its
crew
for
my
especial
benefit
a
dozen
of
agents
are
waiting
to
spring
at
my
throat
i
have
succeeded
so
that
there
is
not
a
man
in
town
who
would
not
be
glad
to
see
me
on
a
yard
arm
and
yet
they
are
waiting
mademoiselle
is
it
not
amusing
can
you
guess
why
they
are
waiting
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
dusted
his
fingers
because
they
fear
that
i
may
burn
the
paper
if
they
disturb
me
they
believe
if
they
keep
hidden
if
i
do
not
suspect
that
i
may
venture
forth
they
hope
to
take
me
alive
or
kill
me
and
still
obtain
the
paper
indeed
it
is
their
one
hope
it
would
be
a
pity
to
disappoint
them
his
lips
had
parted
and
his
eyes
were
shining
in
the
candle
light
there
are
few
things
which
move
me
now
my
lady
all
that
i
really
enjoy
is
an
amusing
situation
and
this
one
is
very
amusing
do
you
think
i
have
crossed
the
ocean
to
deliver
this
document
and
then
i
shall
stop
no
mademoiselle
you
are
mistaken
he
bowed
again
and
stepped
backwards
towards
the
door
pray
do
likewise
mademoiselle
and
forget
he
said
there
is
nothing
in
this
little
episode
fit
for
you
to
remember
it
is
not
you
they
are
after
and
you
will
be
quite
safe
here
i
have
made
sure
of
that
my
son
will
remain
until
your
brother
arrives
and
will
dispense
what
hospitality
you
require
i
trust
he
added
turning
to
me
you
still
remember
why
you
have
been
here
indeed
yes
i
answered
then
it
is
henry
i
shall
not
bother
to
offer
you
my
hand
brutus
you
will
remain
with
my
son
until
a
quarter
to
seven
even
now
i
can
not
tell
what
made
a
mist
come
over
my
eyes
and
a
lump
in
my
throat
any
more
than
i
can
explain
my
subsequent
actions
on
that
evening
was
it
possible
i
was
sorry
to
see
the
last
of
him
or
was
it
simply
self
pity
that
shortened
my
breath
and
made
my
voice
seem
broken
and
discordant
and
after
that
i
asked
he
looked
at
me
appraisingly
tapping
his
thin
fingers
on
his
sword
hilt
after
that
he
stared
thoughtfully
at
the
shadows
of
the
darkened
room
was
he
thinking
as
i
was
of
the
wasted
years
and
what
the
end
would
be
after
that
he
repeated
half
to
himself
come
i
will
make
an
appointment
with
you
after
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
styx
my
son
i
shall
be
waiting
there
i
promise
you
and
we
shall
drink
some
corked
ambrosia
surely
the
gods
must
give
a
little
to
the
shades
or
at
any
rate
brutus
shall
steal
some
and
then
perhaps
you
shall
tell
me
what
happened
after
that
i
shall
look
forward
i
shall
hope
even
that
it
may
be
pleasant
my
son
i
think
he
had
often
planned
that
leave
taking
surely
it
must
have
satisfied
him
xiii
he
was
gone
like
the
shades
of
which
he
had
spoken
and
mademoiselle
and
i
were
left
staring
at
the
black
rectangle
of
the
broken
door
i
drew
a
deep
breath
and
looked
about
me
quickly
it
seemed
somehow
as
though
a
spell
were
broken
as
though
the
curtain
had
lowered
on
some
final
act
in
the
theatre
slowly
my
mind
seemed
to
free
itself
from
a
hundred
illusions
and
to
move
along
more
logical
paths
brutus
went
to
the
arms
rack
in
the
corner
and
selected
a
rusted
cutlass
from
the
small
arms
that
still
rested
there
thrust
it
at
me
playfully
and
grinned
for
a
minute
or
even
more
the
single
log
that
was
still
burning
in
the
fireplace
hissed
drowsily
and
i
could
hear
the
vines
tapping
gently
on
the
windows
then
i
heard
a
pistol
shot
followed
by
a
hoarse
cry
mademoiselle
started
to
her
feet
and
then
sank
back
in
her
chair
again
and
from
where
i
was
standing
i
could
see
that
her
face
was
white
and
her
hands
were
trembling
so
she
loved
him
my
hand
gripped
hard
against
the
back
of
a
chair
why
should
i
have
hoped
she
did
not
god
she
gasped
i
have
killed
him
you
i
cried
but
she
did
not
answer
huh
said
brutus
and
his
grin
grew
broader
monsieur
pistol
he
kill
him
indeed
i
said
for
the
sense
of
unreality
was
still
strong
upon
me
and
whom
did
he
kill
brutus
brutus
cocked
his
head
to
one
side
and
listened
somewhere
behind
came
a
confusion
of
shouts
and
the
thudding
of
horses
hoofs
he
kill
jason
hill
said
brutus
are
you
sure
mademoiselle
demanded
sharply
brutus
nodded
and
the
dull
fixed
look
went
out
of
her
eyes
and
slowly
a
touch
of
color
returned
to
her
cheeks
and
then
there
was
a
clamor
of
voices
and
a
tramp
of
feet
and
a
crash
on
the
door
outside
brutus
looked
about
him
in
wild
indecision
we
have
callers
i
observed
doing
my
best
to
keep
my
voice
calm
who
are
they
brutus
brutus
however
had
forgotten
me
and
had
sprung
into
the
hall
at
almost
the
same
instant
someone
must
have
discovered
that
the
door
was
unlocked
for
a
sudden
draught
eddied
through
the
passage
then
there
was
a
confused
babel
of
voices
to
which
i
did
not
listen
i
was
busy
swinging
up
the
sash
of
the
nearest
window
quickly
mademoiselle
i
whispered
damn
it
someone
shouted
from
the
hall
there
another
of
and
there
came
the
crack
of
a
pistol
that
echoed
loudly
in
the
passage
it
is
time
we
were
going
i
said
out
of
the
window
mademoiselle
in
my
haste
i
almost
pushed
her
from
the
sill
to
the
lawn
and
was
leaning
towards
her
mademoiselle
listen
the
stables
are
straight
to
the
left
can
you
saddle
a
horse
she
nodded
the
first
stall
to
the
right
i
shall
be
there
in
an
instant
for
i
remembered
my
sword
and
sprang
back
into
the
room
to
get
it
get
that
man
someone
was
shouting
in
after
him
you
fools
shoot
in
the
dark
i
had
a
glimpse
of
brutus
darting
through
the
passage
and
making
a
leap
for
the
stairs
then
there
was
a
crash
of
glass
begad
came
a
hoarse
voice
he
jumped
clean
through
the
window
and
another
pistol
exploded
from
the
landing
above
me
five
hundred
dollars
for
the
man
who
gets
him
i
could
swear
i
had
heard
the
voice
before
damn
it
do
let
him
go
out
the
door
all
of
you
out
the
door
men
out
the
door
there
was
a
rush
of
feet
through
the
passage
i
had
a
glimpse
of
men
running
past
and
then
i
was
half
out
the
window
stop
someone
shouted
i
took
a
hasty
glance
behind
me
to
find
that
my
uncle
jason
had
entered
the
morning
room
his
clothing
torn
and
disarranged
the
good
nature
erased
from
his
face
and
a
gash
on
his
left
cheek
that
still
was
bleeding
stop
he
shouted
again
or
i
fire
then
i
was
out
on
the
lawn
with
the
cool
air
from
the
river
on
my
face
and
running
for
the
stable
i
wonder
what
would
have
happened
if
the
evening
had
been
less
far
advanced
or
the
sky
less
overcast
or
mademoiselle
less
adroit
than
providence
had
made
her
she
had
bridled
the
horse
and
was
swinging
the
saddle
on
him
when
i
had
reached
the
stable
shadow
i
could
hear
my
uncle
shouting
for
assistance
as
i
tightened
the
girths
but
brutus
must
have
led
his
men
a
pretty
chase
i
mounted
unmolested
as
i
somehow
knew
i
should
and
helped
her
up
behind
me
somehow
with
that
first
crash
on
our
front
door
i
knew
that
the
game
had
turned
i
knew
that
nothing
would
stop
me
an
odd
sense
of
exaltation
came
over
me
and
with
it
a
strange
desire
to
laugh
it
would
be
amusing
enough
when
i
met
my
father
but
i
wondered
i
wondered
as
i
clapped
my
heels
into
my
horse
flanks
what
had
my
uncle
to
do
in
this
affair
xiv
it
was
just
that
time
in
an
autumn
day
when
the
light
is
fading
out
of
the
sky
the
thick
heavy
mists
that
the
cold
air
encourages
were
rolling
in
chill
and
heavy
from
the
river
and
leveling
the
hollow
places
in
the
land
the
clouds
were
still
a
claret
colored
purple
in
the
west
but
in
another
few
minutes
that
color
would
be
gone
the
shapes
around
us
were
fast
losing
their
distinctiveness
and
their
outlines
were
becoming
more
and
more
a
matter
for
the
memory
and
not
the
eye
and
it
seems
to
me
that
i
never
knew
the
air
to
seem
more
fresh
and
sweet
we
had
broken
into
a
sharp
gallop
down
the
rutted
lane
the
house
gaunt
and
spectral
and
bleaker
and
more
forbidding
than
the
darkening
sky
was
behind
us
and
ahead
were
the
broad
level
meadows
checkered
with
little
clumps
of
willow
and
cedars
as
meadows
are
that
lie
near
the
salt
marshes
i
had
feared
we
might
be
intercepted
at
our
gate
but
i
was
mistaken
we
had
swerved
to
the
left
and
were
thudding
down
the
level
road
when
an
exclamation
from
mademoiselle
made
me
turn
in
my
saddle
my
look
must
have
been
a
somewhat
blank
interrogation
for
mademoiselle
was
laughing
to
think
she
cried
i
should
have
said
you
resembled
your
mother
where
are
we
going
monsieur
but
i
think
she
knew
without
my
answering
for
she
laughed
again
and
i
did
not
entirely
blame
her
it
was
pleasant
enough
to
leave
our
house
behind
it
was
pleasant
to
feel
the
bite
of
the
salt
wind
and
to
see
the
trees
and
the
rocks
by
the
roadside
slip
past
us
gaunt
and
spectral
in
the
evening
i
knew
the
road
well
enough
which
was
fortunate
even
when
we
turned
off
the
beaten
track
over
a
trail
which
was
hardly
as
good
as
a
foot
path
i
was
forced
to
reduce
our
pace
to
a
walk
but
i
was
confident
that
it
did
not
make
much
difference
once
on
the
path
the
farm
was
not
half
a
mile
distant
just
behind
a
ridge
of
rocks
that
was
studded
by
a
stunted
undergrowth
of
wind
beaten
oak
i
knew
the
place
i
could
already
picture
the
gaping
black
windows
the
broken
sagging
ridge
pole
and
the
crumbling
chimney
for
years
the
wind
had
blown
sighing
through
its
deserted
rooms
while
the
rain
rotted
the
planking
it
was
not
strange
that
its
owners
had
left
it
for
i
can
imagine
no
more
mournful
or
desolate
spot
our
own
house
three
miles
away
was
its
nearest
neighbor
and
scarcely
a
congenial
one
around
it
was
nothing
but
rain
sogged
meadows
that
scarcely
rose
above
the
salt
marshes
that
ran
to
the
dunes
where
the
atlantic
was
beating
as
i
stared
grimly
ahead
i
could
picture
her
there
behind
me
the
wind
whipping
the
color
to
her
cheeks
and
playing
with
her
hair
her
eyes
bright
and
gay
in
the
save
for
the
steady
plodding
of
the
horse
it
was
very
still
i
fancied
that
she
had
leaned
nearer
that
her
shoulder
was
touching
mine
that
i
could
feel
her
breath
on
my
cheek
then
she
spoke
and
her
voice
was
almost
a
whisper
it
was
good
of
you
to
take
me
with
you
she
said
surely
mademoiselle
i
replied
you
did
not
think
that
i
would
leave
you
i
should
if
i
had
been
you
she
answered
i
was
rude
to
you
monsieur
and
unjust
to
you
this
morning
you
see
i
did
not
know
you
did
not
know
that
the
son
would
be
as
brave
and
as
resourceful
as
the
father
you
are
monsieur
and
yet
you
are
different
yes
i
said
and
i
am
glad
glad
said
mademoiselle
and
i
am
sorry
you
are
glad
i
said
you
are
sorry
perhaps
mademoiselle
i
replied
with
a
tinge
of
bitterness
i
could
not
suppress
if
i
had
seen
more
of
the
world
if
my
clothes
were
in
better
taste
and
my
manners
less
abrupt
you
would
feel
differently
i
wonder
but
let
us
be
silent
for
we
are
almost
there
as
we
drew
near
making
our
way
through
damp
thickets
a
sense
of
uneasiness
came
over
me
somehow
i
feared
we
might
be
too
late
though
i
knew
that
this
was
hardly
possible
i
feared
and
yet
i
knew
well
enough
it
was
written
somewhere
that
we
should
meet
once
more
with
six
men
after
him
he
would
not
have
ridden
straight
to
the
place
we
should
meet
and
it
would
be
different
from
our
other
meetings
i
wished
that
it
was
light
enough
to
see
his
face
at
a
turn
of
the
path
i
reined
up
and
listened
it
was
very
still
already
the
light
had
gone
out
of
the
sky
and
little
was
left
of
the
land
about
us
save
varying
tones
of
black
had
he
gone
i
cautiously
dismounted
in
a
minute
we
should
see
in
a
minute
then
mademoiselle
interrupted
me
and
i
was
both
astonished
and
irritated
for
my
nerves
were
more
on
edge
than
i
cared
to
have
them
she
was
right
she
was
never
overwrought
we
are
there
she
inquired
softly
mademoiselle
i
cautioned
her
if
you
will
dismount
you
can
see
the
place
it
is
not
three
hundred
feet
beyond
the
thicket
so
you
will
admit
it
is
not
much
to
look
at
if
you
will
hold
the
horse
head
i
will
go
forward
i
did
not
listen
to
an
objection
that
she
was
framing
but
slipped
hastily
through
the
trees
as
the
ugly
mass
of
the
house
took
a
more
certain
shape
before
me
i
felt
my
pulse
beat
more
rapidly
and
not
entirely
through
elation
even
today
when
i
look
at
a
place
that
men
have
built
and
then
abandoned
something
of
the
same
feeling
comes
over
me
but
not
as
strongly
as
it
did
that
evening
it
was
another
matter
that
made
me
hesitate
from
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
i
heard
a
sound
which
was
too
much
like
the
raising
of
a
pistol
hammer
not
to
make
me
remember
that
a
sword
was
all
i
carried
there
is
no
need
to
cock
that
pistol
i
said
in
a
tone
which
i
hoped
sounded
more
confident
than
my
state
of
mind
i
halted
but
there
was
no
answer
and
no
further
sound
i
said
i
repeated
raising
my
voice
there
is
no
need
to
cock
that
pistol
it
is
a
friend
of
captain
shelton
who
is
speaking
so
said
a
voice
in
careful
precise
english
walk
three
paces
forward
if
you
please
and
slowly
slowly
now
you
are
a
friend
of
the
captain
in
a
sense
i
replied
i
am
his
son
i
have
come
to
you
with
a
message
so
said
the
voice
again
and
i
saw
that
a
man
was
seated
before
me
on
the
stone
that
had
served
as
a
doorstep
a
man
who
was
balancing
a
pistol
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
i
fear
i
have
been
rude
he
said
but
i
find
this
place
what
shall
i
say
annoying
your
voices
are
alike
and
i
know
he
has
a
son
you
say
you
bring
a
message
i
had
thought
what
to
say
it
is
about
the
paper
i
began
the
captain
was
to
bring
it
to
you
here
and
now
he
finds
he
can
not
can
not
he
said
with
the
rising
inflection
of
another
language
than
ours
can
not
rather
i
corrected
myself
hastily
he
finds
it
more
expedient
to
meet
you
elsewhere
ah
he
said
that
is
better
for
a
moment
i
feared
the
captain
was
dead
so
the
paper
he
still
has
it
he
not
only
has
it
i
said
but
he
is
ready
to
give
it
to
you
at
another
place
he
has
named
you
are
a
stranger
to
the
country
here
my
question
was
not
a
welcome
one
absolute
he
replied
with
conviction
do
you
take
me
for
a
native
of
these
sink
holes
mon
dieu
does
your
mud
so
completely
cover
me
but
surely
it
must
be
this
cursed
darkness
or
you
would
have
said
differently
where
is
this
other
place
i
was
glad
it
was
too
dark
for
him
to
see
my
smile
unfortunately
i
can
not
guide
you
there
i
said
for
i
am
to
stop
here
in
case
i
am
followed
we
have
had
to
be
careful
very
careful
indeed
you
understand
impatiently
he
shifted
his
position
for
six
months
he
replied
irritably
i
have
been
doing
nothing
else
careful
always
careful
it
becomes
unbearable
but
where
is
this
place
you
speak
of
in
some
other
bog
i
pointed
to
the
left
of
the
trees
where
mademoiselle
was
standing
i
quite
understand
i
said
politely
even
a
day
with
this
paper
is
quite
enough
but
it
is
not
a
bog
and
you
can
reach
it
quite
easily
you
see
where
i
point
simply
follow
that
field
in
that
direction
for
half
a
mile
perhaps
and
you
will
come
to
a
road
turn
to
your
right
and
after
three
miles
you
will
see
a
house
the
first
house
you
will
meet
in
fact
it
has
a
gambrel
roof
and
overlooks
the
river
simply
knock
on
the
door
so
one
knock
a
pause
and
three
in
succession
it
will
be
understood
you
have
a
horse
what
is
left
of
him
he
replied
though
the
good
god
knows
how
he
has
carried
me
along
this
far
yes
he
is
attached
to
a
post
well
we
are
off
and
may
the
paper
stay
still
till
we
get
it
you
wait
here
in
case
we
are
followed
i
said
he
pointed
straight
before
him
i
have
been
hearing
noises
over
there
breaking
of
branches
and
shouts
then
in
the
name
of
heaven
ride
on
i
said
and
added
as
an
afterthought
and
turn
out
to
the
side
if
you
see
anyone
coming
the
pleasure
i
took
in
seeing
him
leave
was
not
entirely
unalloyed
as
i
walked
to
the
oak
thicket
where
mademoiselle
was
waiting
i
even
had
some
vague
idea
of
calling
him
back
for
i
do
not
believe
in
doing
anyone
a
turn
that
is
worse
than
necessary
yet
there
was
only
one
other
way
i
could
think
of
to
keep
him
silent
besides
sending
him
where
he
was
going
she
was
feeding
the
horse
handfuls
of
grass
it
is
quite
all
right
mademoiselle
i
said
let
us
move
to
the
house
it
may
be
more
comfortable
in
the
doorway
we
stood
silently
for
a
while
listening
to
the
wind
and
the
dull
monotonous
roar
of
the
surf
while
the
night
grew
blacker
i
listened
attentively
but
there
was
no
sound
surely
he
was
coming
tell
me
monsieur
said
mademoiselle
what
sort
of
woman
was
your
mother
unbidden
a
picture
of
her
came
before
me
that
seemed
strangely
out
of
place
she
was
very
beautiful
i
said
she
sighed
and
very
proud
said
mademoiselle
yes
very
proud
why
did
she
call
him
a
thief
monsieur
but
i
did
not
answer
you
are
certain
your
father
is
coming
she
asked
finally
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
i
told
her
i
have
seen
him
ride
mademoiselle
it
would
take
more
than
a
dozen
men
to
lay
hands
on
him
they
should
have
known
better
than
let
him
leave
the
house
listen
mademoiselle
i
believe
you
can
hear
him
now
my
ears
were
quicker
in
those
days
for
a
minute
we
listened
in
silence
and
then
on
the
wind
i
heard
more
distinctly
still
the
regular
thud
of
a
galloping
horse
so
he
was
coming
as
i
knew
he
would
i
knew
he
would
be
methodical
and
accurate
yes
mademoiselle
i
continued
my
father
has
many
accomplishments
but
this
time
even
he
may
be
surprised
who
knows
mademoiselle
pray
step
back
inside
the
doorway
until
i
call
you
but
she
did
not
move
no
said
mademoiselle
i
prefer
to
stay
where
i
am
i
have
seen
too
much
of
you
and
your
father
to
leave
you
alone
together
but
surely
mademoiselle
i
protested
you
forget
why
we
have
come
yes
she
answered
quickly
yes
you
are
right
i
do
forget
i
have
seen
too
much
of
this
too
much
of
utter
useless
folly
too
many
men
dying
too
many
suffering
for
a
hopeless
cause
i
have
seen
three
men
lying
dead
in
our
hall
and
as
many
more
wounded
i
have
seen
a
strong
man
turned
into
a
blackguard
i
have
seen
a
son
turned
against
his
father
and
all
for
a
bit
of
paper
which
should
never
have
been
written
i
hate
it
do
you
hear
me
and
if
i
forget
it
it
is
because
i
choose
i
forget
it
because
she
seemed
about
to
tell
me
more
and
then
to
think
better
of
it
surely
you
see
surely
you
see
you
can
not
he
is
your
father
monsieur
the
man
who
is
coming
here
mademoiselle
i
replied
you
are
far
too
kind
i
hardly
think
he
or
i
have
much
reason
to
hold
our
lives
of
any
particular
value
but
as
you
have
said
my
father
was
a
gentleman
once
and
gentlemen
very
seldom
kill
their
sons
nor
gentlemen
sons
their
fathers
pray
rest
assured
mademoiselle
it
will
be
a
quiet
interview
i
beg
you
be
silent
for
he
is
almost
here
i
was
not
mistaken
a
horse
was
on
the
path
we
followed
running
hard
and
crashing
recklessly
through
the
bushes
before
i
had
sight
of
him
i
heard
my
father
voice
ives
he
called
sharply
where
the
devil
are
you
and
in
an
instant
he
was
at
the
door
his
horse
breathing
in
hard
sobbing
breaths
and
he
had
swung
from
the
saddle
as
i
went
forward
to
meet
him
here
he
said
take
it
and
be
off
those
fools
have
run
me
over
half
the
state
in
fact
he
continued
in
the
calm
tones
i
remember
best
in
fact
i
have
seldom
had
a
more
interesting
evening
i
was
fired
on
before
i
had
passed
the
gate
and
chased
as
though
i
carried
the
treasures
of
the
raj
i
have
your
word
never
to
tell
where
you
got
it
never
mind
my
reasons
or
the
thanks
either
take
it
ives
it
has
saved
me
so
many
a
dull
day
that
it
has
quite
repaid
my
trouble
there
he
was
half
a
pace
away
and
yet
he
did
not
know
me
i
think
it
was
that
more
than
anything
else
which
robbed
me
of
my
elation
to
him
the
whole
thing
seemed
an
ordinary
piece
of
business
i
saw
him
test
his
girth
preparatory
to
mounting
again
saw
him
slowly
readjust
his
cloak
and
then
i
took
the
paper
he
handed
me
and
buttoned
it
carefully
in
my
inside
pocket
he
turned
to
his
horse
again
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
withers
but
still
he
did
not
mount
i
think
he
was
staring
into
the
night
before
him
and
listening
as
i
had
been
then
he
turned
again
slowly
and
half
faced
me
on
the
wind
far
off
still
but
nevertheless
distinct
was
the
sound
of
voices
it
is
time
we
were
going
said
my
father
i
only
gave
them
the
slip
five
minutes
back
it
was
closer
work
than
i
had
expected
and
then
he
started
and
looked
at
me
more
intently
through
the
darkness
name
of
the
devil
said
my
father
how
did
you
get
here
but
that
was
all
he
never
even
started
his
hand
still
rested
tranquilly
on
the
reins
and
he
still
half
faced
me
had
it
been
so
on
that
other
night
long
ago
when
his
world
crumbled
to
ruins
about
him
did
he
always
win
and
lose
with
the
same
passive
acquiescence
did
nothing
ever
astonish
him
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
i
felt
his
eyes
on
me
and
suddenly
became
very
cautious
i
knew
well
enough
he
would
not
let
it
finish
in
such
a
manner
but
what
could
he
do
the
game
was
in
my
hands
quite
simply
i
told
him
my
horse
was
in
the
stable
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
was
still
pleasantly
conversational
and
brutus
he
asked
where
the
devil
was
brutus
surely
the
age
of
miracles
is
past
or
do
i
see
before
me
he
bowed
with
all
his
old
courtesy
another
david
brutus
i
replied
jumped
through
a
second
story
window
indeed
he
said
he
always
was
most
agile
he
was
i
replied
not
five
minutes
after
you
left
uncle
jason
arrived
my
father
removed
his
hand
from
the
reins
and
looped
them
through
his
arm
indeed
he
said
he
came
in
heels
first
i
trust
no
i
said
he
is
alive
and
well
the
devil
said
my
father
and
sighed
i
am
growing
old
my
son
i
know
my
horse
spoiled
my
aim
and
yet
he
fell
and
i
rode
over
him
i
had
hoped
to
be
finished
with
your
uncle
jason
you
say
he
entered
the
house
and
told
me
to
stop
i
said
and
you
did
not
no
i
replied
i
succeeded
in
getting
out
of
a
window
also
and
then
although
i
could
not
see
him
i
knew
he
had
undergone
a
change
and
i
knew
that
i
was
facing
a
different
man
his
hand
fell
on
my
shoulder
and
to
my
surprise
it
was
trembling
god
he
cried
in
a
voice
that
was
suddenly
harsh
and
forbidding
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
left
mademoiselle
and
never
struck
a
blow
you
left
her
there
not
entirely
i
replied
my
father
became
very
gentle
will
you
be
done
with
this
he
said
the
lady
where
is
she
now
and
then
half
to
himself
he
added
how
was
i
to
know
they
would
break
in
the
house
after
i
had
gone
mademoiselle
i
replied
is
not
fifteen
feet
away
his
hand
went
up
to
the
clasp
of
his
cloak
and
again
his
voice
became
pleasantly
conversational
ah
that
is
better
said
my
father
and
so
you
got
the
paper
after
all
yes
i
am
growing
old
my
son
i
appear
to
have
bungled
badly
do
you
hope
to
keep
the
paper
in
the
distance
i
heard
a
voice
again
raised
in
a
shout
surely
he
understood
they
are
coming
i
said
yes
i
intend
to
keep
the
paper
indeed
said
my
father
perhaps
you
will
explain
how
my
son
i
have
had
an
active
evening
but
you
i
confess
you
go
quite
ahead
of
me
because
i
said
you
are
not
anxious
to
go
back
to
france
father
and
you
are
almost
on
your
way
there
no
not
to
france
he
answered
and
i
knew
he
saw
my
meaning
and
yet
they
are
coming
to
take
you
if
you
so
much
as
offer
to
touch
me
again
i
shall
call
them
father
and
we
shall
go
back
together
your
horse
is
tired
he
can
not
go
much
further
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
i
prudently
stepped
back
you
might
shoot
me
of
course
i
added
but
a
pistol
shot
would
be
equally
good
listen
i
can
hear
them
on
the
road
but
oddly
enough
he
was
not
disturbed
on
the
road
to
be
sure
said
my
father
you
are
right
henry
you
may
keep
the
paper
but
tell
me
one
thing
more
was
there
no
one
here
when
you
arrived
there
was
i
said
but
i
sent
him
away
to
our
house
father
he
sighed
and
smoothed
his
cloak
thoughtfully
i
fear
that
i
have
become
quite
hopeless
as
you
say
if
i
fire
a
pistol
they
will
come
and
now
i
can
hardly
see
any
reason
to
keep
them
away
so
you
sent
him
to
the
house
my
son
and
jason
is
still
alive
and
you
have
got
the
paper
can
it
be
that
i
have
failed
in
everything
strange
how
the
cards
fall
even
if
we
stack
the
deck
ah
well
then
it
is
the
pistols
after
all
there
was
a
blinding
flash
and
the
roar
of
a
weapon
close
beside
me
and
i
heard
mademoiselle
scream
my
father
turned
to
quiet
his
horse
do
not
be
alarmed
mademoiselle
he
said
gently
we
are
not
killing
each
other
i
am
merely
using
a
somewhat
rigorous
method
of
bringing
my
son
to
his
senses
he
paused
reached
under
his
cloak
drew
a
second
pistol
and
fired
again
from
the
road
there
came
a
sound
that
seemed
to
ring
pleasantly
to
my
father
ears
nearer
than
i
thought
he
said
brightly
they
should
be
here
in
three
minutes
at
the
outside
shall
we
sit
a
while
and
talk
my
son
it
is
gloomy
here
i
admit
but
still
it
has
its
advantages
they
thought
my
rendezvous
was
ten
miles
to
the
north
lord
what
fools
they
were
lawton
bit
at
the
letter
i
let
him
seize
as
though
it
were
pork
ah
if
it
had
not
been
for
jason
well
everything
must
have
an
ending
he
threw
his
bridle
over
his
arm
and
was
walking
toward
the
doorstep
lightly
buoyant
as
though
some
weight
were
lifted
from
his
mind
hastily
i
seized
his
arm
stop
i
cried
what
is
to
become
of
mademoiselle
we
can
not
leave
her
here
like
this
have
you
forgotten
she
is
with
us
seemingly
still
unhurried
he
paused
and
glanced
toward
the
road
and
then
back
at
me
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
laughed
and
his
laughter
genuine
and
gave
me
a
start
which
the
sound
of
his
pistol
had
not
the
incongruity
of
it
set
my
nerves
on
edge
was
there
nothing
that
would
give
him
genuine
concern
good
god
sir
i
shouted
furiously
there
nothing
to
laugh
about
do
you
hear
them
coming
ah
said
my
father
i
thought
that
would
fetch
you
so
you
have
come
to
your
senses
then
and
we
can
go
on
together
untie
your
horse
henry
while
i
charge
the
pistols
my
hand
was
on
the
bridle
rein
when
a
shout
close
by
us
made
me
loosen
the
knot
more
quickly
than
i
intended
i
could
make
out
the
black
form
of
a
horseman
moving
towards
us
at
full
gallop
it
must
be
lawton
observed
my
father
evenly
he
is
well
mounted
and
quite
reckless
i
suppose
we
had
better
be
going
i
shall
help
mademoiselle
if
she
will
permit
no
it
is
not
lawton
i
am
sorry
he
raised
his
arm
and
fired
my
horse
started
at
the
sound
of
his
shot
and
as
i
tried
to
quiet
him
i
saw
my
father
lift
mademoiselle
to
the
saddle
yes
he
said
again
i
think
it
is
time
to
be
going
these
men
seem
to
have
a
most
commendable
determination
ha
there
are
two
more
of
them
put
your
horse
to
the
gallop
my
son
the
tide
is
out
and
we
can
manage
the
marsh
the
marsh
i
exclaimed
quite
he
replied
tranquilly
if
brutus
is
alive
he
will
have
a
boat
near
the
dunes
opposite
it
seems
as
though
we
might
be
obliged
to
take
an
ocean
voyage
it
seemed
to
me
he
had
gone
quite
mad
the
marsh
he
knew
as
well
as
i
was
as
full
of
holes
as
a
piece
of
cheese
even
in
the
daytime
one
could
hardly
ride
across
it
and
then
i
knew
that
what
he
said
was
true
that
he
would
stop
at
nothing
and
suddenly
a
fear
came
over
me
for
the
first
time
i
feared
the
quiet
pleasant
man
who
rode
beside
my
bridle
rein
as
though
we
were
traversing
the
main
street
of
our
town
ah
said
my
father
it
is
pleasant
to
have
a
little
exercise
give
him
the
spurs
henry
we
shall
either
get
across
or
we
shall
not
there
is
no
use
being
cautious
i
put
my
horse
over
a
ditch
and
straight
ahead
i
may
have
ridden
four
hundred
yards
with
the
even
beating
of
his
horse
behind
me
before
what
i
feared
happened
my
horse
stumbled
and
the
pull
of
my
bridle
barely
got
him
up
again
i
gave
him
the
spur
but
he
was
failing
in
a
quarter
of
a
minute
he
had
fallen
again
and
this
time
the
bridle
did
not
raise
him
i
sprang
free
of
him
before
he
had
entirely
slipped
down
in
the
soft
sea
mud
he
was
lashing
about
desperately
nor
could
i
get
him
to
answer
when
i
pulled
at
the
bridle
my
father
reined
up
beside
me
and
dismounted
his
leg
is
broken
he
said
it
is
inopportune
ah
they
are
still
after
us
and
he
turned
to
look
behind
him
why
are
you
waiting
i
cried
ride
on
sir
and
leave
you
here
with
the
paper
in
your
pocket
said
my
father
the
fall
has
quite
got
the
better
of
you
the
other
pistol
mademoiselle
if
you
have
finished
loading
it
here
they
come
to
be
sure
would
you
not
think
the
fools
would
realize
i
can
hit
them
he
fired
into
the
darkness
and
a
riderless
horse
ran
almost
on
top
of
us
with
a
snort
of
fright
he
reared
and
wheeled
and
a
second
shot
answered
my
father
ah
said
my
father
they
always
will
shoot
before
they
can
see
the
pistol
from
the
holster
if
you
please
mademoiselle
they
had
not
realized
we
had
halted
for
the
last
rider
charged
past
us
before
he
could
check
himself
i
had
a
glimpse
of
his
face
white
against
the
night
and
i
saw
him
tug
furiously
at
his
bit
an
unfortunate
matter
so
it
happened
for
the
footing
beneath
the
marsh
grass
was
bad
and
his
horse
slewed
and
fell
on
top
of
him
pah
exclaimed
my
father
it
is
almost
sad
to
watch
them
let
us
go
henry
he
is
knocked
even
more
senseless
than
he
was
before
keep
the
saddle
mademoiselle
and
we
will
lead
you
across
i
fancy
that
is
the
last
of
them
for
a
moment
so
we
tumbled
through
the
mud
at
a
walk
slipping
noisily
at
every
step
but
my
father
was
correct
in
his
prophecy
only
the
noise
of
our
progress
interrupted
us
the
sand
dunes
were
becoming
something
more
than
a
shadow
my
father
walked
in
tranquil
silence
at
the
bridle
while
i
trudged
beside
him
are
you
hurt
captain
mademoiselle
demanded
indeed
not
he
replied
what
was
there
to
hurt
me
i
was
thinking
that
is
all
but
why
do
you
ask
my
lady
only
said
mademoiselle
because
you
have
been
silent
for
the
past
five
minutes
and
you
never
are
more
gay
than
when
you
embark
on
an
adventure
i
never
heard
you
say
two
words
captain
until
that
night
on
the
loire
let
us
forget
the
loire
replied
my
father
shall
i
be
quite
frank
with
you
mademoiselle
it
would
be
amusing
she
admitted
leaning
from
the
saddle
towards
him
if
it
were
only
possible
she
added
then
listen
mademoiselle
he
continued
and
i
shall
be
very
frank
indeed
it
must
be
the
sea
air
which
makes
me
so
i
seldom
talk
unless
i
feel
that
my
days
for
talking
are
nearly
over
and
at
present
they
seem
to
stretch
before
me
most
interminably
in
a
moment
we
shall
see
the
boat
and
in
a
moment
the
i
fear
i
have
been
very
foolish
father
i
inquired
will
you
answer
me
a
question
perhaps
said
my
father
what
has
my
uncle
to
do
with
the
paper
my
son
said
my
father
may
i
ask
you
a
question
perhaps
i
replied
how
much
money
did
your
mother
leave
you
at
her
death
she
had
none
to
leave
i
replied
quickly
ah
said
my
father
have
you
ever
wondered
why
you
should
be
able
to
tell
me
i
answered
coldly
indeed
said
my
father
but
here
we
are
at
the
dunes
the
boat
my
son
do
you
see
it
i
scrambled
up
ahead
through
the
sand
and
beach
grass
and
the
white
line
of
the
beach
which
even
the
darkest
night
can
never
hide
lay
clear
before
me
a
high
surf
was
running
and
beyond
it
i
could
see
three
lights
blinking
fitfully
in
the
black
and
nearer
on
the
white
sand
was
the
shadow
of
a
fishing
boat
pulled
just
above
the
tide
mark
a
minute
later
brutus
came
running
toward
us
my
father
was
evidently
used
to
such
small
matters
indeed
the
whole
affair
seemed
such
a
part
of
his
daily
life
as
to
demand
nothing
unusual
he
glanced
casually
at
the
waves
and
the
boat
tossed
off
his
cloak
on
the
sand
carefully
wrapped
his
pistols
inside
it
and
placed
the
bundle
carefully
beneath
a
thwart
the
rocket
brutus
said
my
father
if
you
will
get
in
mademoiselle
we
will
contrive
to
push
you
through
the
breakers
best
take
your
coat
off
my
son
and
place
it
over
the
pistols
xv
brutus
had
evidently
kept
a
slow
match
burning
for
with
a
sudden
flare
a
rocket
flashed
into
the
wind
in
the
momentary
glare
of
the
light
i
could
see
my
father
his
lips
pressed
together
more
tightly
than
usual
but
alertly
courteous
as
ever
helping
mademoiselle
over
the
side
and
there
was
brutus
grinning
at
me
then
the
light
died
and
my
father
continued
giving
his
directions
stand
by
master
henry
at
the
stern
brutus
i
shall
stay
here
amidships
now
into
the
water
when
i
give
the
word
pray
do
not
be
alarmed
mademoiselle
there
is
quite
nothing
to
bother
a
breaker
crashed
down
on
the
beach
ahead
of
us
now
he
shouted
and
a
moment
later
we
were
up
to
our
waists
in
water
that
was
stinging
in
its
coldness
get
aboard
said
my
father
the
oars
brutus
drenched
and
gasping
i
pulled
myself
over
the
side
just
as
we
topped
a
second
wave
my
father
was
beside
me
as
bland
and
unconcerned
as
ever
you
see
mademoiselle
he
said
we
are
quite
safe
the
is
standing
in
already
while
brutus
is
rowing
my
son
we
had
better
load
the
pistols
surely
we
are
through
with
them
i
said
the
boat
was
tossing
wildly
and
brutus
was
using
all
his
strength
and
skill
to
keep
it
in
the
wind
still
said
my
father
kneeling
on
the
grating
beside
me
let
us
load
them
look
henry
i
think
we
got
off
in
very
good
time
a
knot
of
horsemen
were
galloping
down
the
beach
we
had
just
quitted
they
must
have
taken
the
old
wagon
road
he
said
i
had
thought
as
much
it
becomes
almost
tiresome
this
running
away
he
reached
for
his
cloak
placed
it
over
mademoiselle
shoulders
and
seated
himself
in
the
stern
beside
her
apparently
forgetful
that
he
was
drenched
from
head
to
foot
you
are
not
afraid
mademoiselle
he
asked
afraid
indeed
not
i
heard
her
reply
in
a
voice
that
was
muffled
by
the
wind
it
is
a
luxury
captain
which
you
have
made
me
do
without
too
long
good
said
my
father
a
motionless
shadow
beside
her
if
you
can
not
trust
yourself
there
are
plenty
of
other
things
to
trust
in
god
for
example
or
the
devil
if
you
prefer
or
even
in
circumstances
how
useless
it
is
to
be
afraid
when
you
remember
these
put
the
boat
up
a
little
more
brutus
and
he
sat
silent
watching
the
lights
of
the
ship
towards
which
we
were
moving
with
each
tug
that
brutus
gave
the
oars
the
ship
also
was
drawing
nearer
we
could
make
out
the
spars
under
shortened
sail
and
soon
we
were
hailed
from
the
deck
my
father
called
back
and
then
there
came
the
snapping
of
canvass
as
they
put
up
the
helm
and
the
ship
lost
way
tossing
in
the
wind
wet
and
shivering
i
watched
her
draw
toward
us
so
this
was
the
end
after
all
and
i
was
glad
it
was
over
glad
that
i
would
soon
be
quiet
and
alone
with
my
thoughts
could
it
have
been
only
yesterday
that
i
had
turned
my
horse
and
passed
between
the
sagging
posts
that
marked
the
entrance
to
his
house
was
it
only
a
day
ago
i
had
first
seen
him
leaning
back
idly
in
his
arm
chair
by
the
fire
my
father
leaned
forward
and
thrust
something
into
my
hand
a
pistol
henry
he
said
put
it
inside
your
shirt
it
will
be
a
souvenir
for
you
when
you
are
home
again
we
could
hear
the
waves
slapping
against
the
vessel
sides
and
the
orders
from
the
deck
above
us
as
i
looked
it
seemed
a
perilous
distance
away
alongside
brutus
said
my
father
two
lanterns
cast
a
feeble
glow
on
the
sheets
of
water
that
rolled
under
us
shouldering
our
frail
boat
impatiently
in
their
haste
to
move
along
brutus
pulled
an
oar
sharply
i
saw
a
ladder
dangling
perilously
from
the
bulwarks
i
saw
brutus
seize
it
and
then
our
boat
arrested
and
stationary
began
to
toss
madly
in
effort
my
father
sprang
up
balancing
himself
lightly
and
accurately
against
each
sudden
roll
now
mademoiselle
he
said
we
will
get
on
deck
brutus
will
carry
you
up
quite
safely
hold
the
ladder
henry
hold
to
it
or
we
may
be
in
the
water
again
his
voice
was
still
coldly
precise
not
raised
even
to
a
higher
pitch
you
are
chilled
my
son
he
asked
never
mind
we
will
have
brandy
in
a
moment
strange
how
the
years
make
the
path
seem
smooth
and
mellow
as
i
look
back
on
it
today
boarding
the
ship
seems
a
light
enough
matter
though
i
know
now
that
every
moment
we
remained
by
the
ladder
eternity
was
staring
us
in
the
face
even
now
when
i
look
back
on
it
the
water
is
not
what
i
see
nor
brutus
grasping
at
the
dangling
rope
but
rather
my
father
standing
watching
the
ladder
detached
from
the
motion
and
excitement
around
him
a
passive
onlooker
to
whom
what
might
happen
seemed
a
matter
of
small
concern
brutus
holding
mademoiselle
on
one
arm
managed
the
ladder
with
ready
adroitness
and
i
followed
safely
but
not
before
i
had
been
hurled
against
the
side
with
a
force
that
nearly
drove
away
my
breath
i
reached
the
deck
to
find
a
lantern
thrust
into
my
face
and
stared
into
it
for
the
moment
quite
blinded
it
is
the
son
remarked
a
voice
which
i
thought
i
remembered
and
then
my
father
followed
me
we
are
on
board
aiken
he
called
never
mind
the
boat
get
your
men
on
the
braces
or
we
blow
on
shore
yes
captain
shelton
said
the
voice
again
you
are
on
board
to
be
sure
and
very
prettily
done
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
all
evening
indeed
said
my
father
in
his
old
level
tone
and
who
the
devil
are
you
sims
captain
came
the
reply
i
managed
to
seize
your
ship
before
it
left
the
river
it
is
hard
after
so
much
trouble
but
you
are
my
prisoner
captain
shelton
my
eyes
had
become
accustomed
to
the
light
i
looked
about
me
to
find
we
were
in
the
center
of
a
group
of
men
sims
small
and
watchful
his
face
a
pale
yellow
in
the
glow
was
standing
beside
a
tall
man
who
held
the
lantern
at
arm
length
my
father
was
facing
him
about
two
paces
distant
his
hand
on
the
wet
and
bedraggled
lapel
of
his
coat
his
glance
vague
and
thoughtful
as
though
he
was
examining
at
his
leisure
some
phenomenon
of
nature
brutus
looking
as
unpleasant
as
i
had
ever
seen
him
had
half
thrust
mademoiselle
behind
his
back
and
stood
half
crouching
his
eye
on
my
father
hand
his
thick
lips
moving
nervously
my
father
patted
his
coat
gently
and
sighed
i
must
admit
he
said
that
this
is
surprisingly
indeed
quite
delightfully
unexpected
i
hope
you
have
been
quite
comfortable
sims
permitted
himself
to
smile
i
told
them
you
were
a
man
of
sense
he
said
is
it
not
odd
that
only
you
and
i
should
have
imagination
and
ingenuity
i
knew
you
would
see
when
the
game
is
over
my
compliments
captain
shelton
you
deserve
to
have
done
better
of
course
said
my
father
with
a
slow
nod
of
assent
i
see
when
the
game
is
over
i
knew
you
would
be
reasonable
said
sims
when
it
is
finished
you
and
i
stop
playing
do
we
not
i
am
sorry
we
were
not
on
the
same
side
but
i
have
been
commissioned
to
take
you
captain
for
a
little
man
whom
you
and
i
both
knew
back
in
paris
i
have
a
dozen
men
aboard
now
who
will
get
us
to
the
harbor
you
are
a
prisoner
of
france
as
you
have
doubtless
guessed
we
shall
all
be
to
jason
schooner
which
has
been
waiting
for
you
and
now
you
may
go
below
still
staring
thoughtfully
before
him
my
father
rested
his
chin
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
i
remember
you
now
he
said
and
may
i
add
it
is
a
pleasure
to
have
met
you
it
is
still
a
pleasure
much
as
i
resent
being
taken
on
board
a
ship
i
own
sims
bowed
ironically
and
now
captain
the
document
if
you
please
unless
you
care
to
be
searched
i
thought
my
father
had
not
heard
for
he
still
looked
quite
blandly
at
the
lantern
would
you
mind
telling
me
he
inquired
what
became
of
my
crew
you
bribed
them
i
suppose
there
was
only
an
anchor
watch
on
deck
when
we
came
on
board
said
sims
we
drove
them
below
quite
easily
the
only
man
who
gave
us
any
trouble
was
your
master
we
had
to
hit
him
over
the
head
when
he
reached
the
deck
my
father
nodded
slowly
seemed
to
lose
his
balance
on
the
rolling
deck
recovered
himself
and
set
his
feet
a
trifle
wider
apart
i
am
sincerely
sorry
for
you
sims
he
said
but
if
sims
ever
asked
why
it
was
in
another
life
than
ours
i
recall
his
sudden
bewilderment
but
i
never
have
understood
exactly
how
it
happened
i
remember
brutus
eyes
on
my
father
hand
as
it
moved
so
gently
over
his
coat
it
must
have
been
some
gesture
smooth
and
imperceptible
for
suddenly
my
father
languor
left
him
suddenly
his
lips
curled
back
in
a
smile
devoid
of
humor
and
he
leapt
at
the
lantern
he
leapt
and
at
the
same
instant
as
perfectly
timed
as
though
the
whole
matter
had
been
carefully
rehearsed
brutus
great
bulk
had
streaked
across
the
deck
crashing
towards
sims
like
an
unleashed
fury
the
speed
of
it
the
unexpectedness
the
sheer
audacity
held
the
men
around
us
motionless
sims
had
barely
time
to
level
the
pistol
he
was
holding
but
when
he
fired
the
deck
was
in
darkness
this
way
mademoiselle
came
my
father
voice
and
i
ran
towards
it
hold
them
off
brutus
he
was
calling
ha
it
is
you
my
son
while
he
was
speaking
he
darted
lightly
aft
and
i
followed
behind
me
came
the
confused
babel
of
struggling
men
someone
was
calling
for
a
light
and
someone
was
shrieking
for
help
a
man
with
a
lantern
was
running
forward
i
tripped
him
and
we
fell
together
and
then
i
felt
a
hand
on
my
collar
it
dragged
me
to
my
feet
i
struck
at
it
blindly
while
i
felt
myself
being
half
pulled
half
carried
through
the
black
and
then
i
heard
my
father
voice
again
close
beside
me
as
slow
and
cold
as
ever
close
the
door
brutus
he
said
listen
to
them
they
must
think
we
are
still
there
and
then
i
knew
what
had
happened
brutus
had
dragged
me
with
him
and
we
were
in
a
cabin
i
heard
my
father
fumbling
about
in
the
dark
ah
he
said
here
is
the
powder
load
these
pistols
brutus
gently
you
fool
do
you
want
to
kill
me
you
are
hurt
captain
cried
mademoiselle
it
is
not
worth
troubling
over
said
my
father
and
you
my
lady
you
are
quite
all
right
i
fear
i
handled
you
roughly
i
was
afraid
for
a
moment
we
might
be
inconvenienced
and
now
i
said
sarcastically
speaking
into
the
darkness
before
me
i
suppose
our
troubles
are
over
i
think
so
replied
my
father
now
that
brutus
has
thrown
sims
overboard
it
might
be
different
if
he
were
still
with
us
he
seemed
to
be
a
determined
and
resourceful
man
we
are
in
the
after
cabin
henry
quite
the
pleasantest
one
on
the
ship
and
not
ten
paces
from
the
wheel
still
out
of
breath
still
confused
i
tried
to
look
but
could
see
nothing
i
could
only
smell
the
pungent
odor
of
tarred
rope
and
stale
tobacco
smoke
having
finished
speaking
i
could
hear
my
father
still
moving
about
deliberately
and
moderately
seemingly
well
pleased
at
the
place
where
we
had
been
driven
yes
he
said
again
not
ten
paces
from
the
wheel
and
now
we
will
finish
it
will
you
never
be
serious
sir
i
cried
do
you
suppose
they
are
going
to
let
you
take
charge
of
the
ship
i
think
so
replied
my
father
but
first
i
must
take
a
swallow
from
my
flask
there
is
nothing
like
a
drink
to
rest
one
open
the
port
by
the
door
brutus
and
i
felt
him
groping
his
way
past
me
brutus
he
said
pass
the
flask
to
my
son
and
give
me
a
pistol
and
steady
me
with
your
arm
so
ah
that
is
better
much
better
he
fired
and
the
sound
of
his
pistol
in
the
closed
room
made
my
ears
ring
and
then
the
ship
lurched
so
that
i
had
nearly
lost
my
balance
we
were
rolling
heavily
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
and
outside
the
canvas
was
snapping
like
a
dozen
small
arms
and
then
i
knew
what
had
happened
my
father
had
shot
the
man
at
the
helm
shot
him
where
he
stood
so
that
the
wheel
had
broken
from
his
grasp
so
that
the
ship
was
out
of
control
and
the
wind
was
blowing
it
on
shore
had
he
thought
of
the
plan
while
he
was
watching
sims
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
i
half
suspected
that
he
had
not
but
i
never
knew
open
the
door
brutus
said
my
father
and
suddenly
his
voice
was
raised
to
a
shout
that
rose
above
the
wind
and
the
sails
keep
clear
of
that
wheel
if
a
single
man
touches
it
do
you
hear
me
stand
clear
and
he
fired
again
and
the
still
lurched
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
i
ran
to
the
door
beside
him
ten
paces
away
the
light
of
the
binnacle
was
burning
and
by
it
i
saw
two
men
lying
huddled
on
the
deck
and
the
ship
wheel
whirling
backwards
and
forwards
as
the
waves
hit
the
rudder
get
the
wheel
someone
was
shouting
frantically
get
the
wheel
being
blown
on
the
bar
get
the
wheel
stand
clear
you
dogs
called
my
father
we
all
going
on
the
bar
together
brutus
he
added
go
forward
and
open
the
forecastle
and
tell
my
men
to
clear
the
decks
if
any
of
these
fools
notice
you
kill
them
but
they
wo
brutus
they
wo
their
minds
are
too
much
set
on
a
watery
grave
the
ship
heeled
far
over
on
her
side
as
another
gust
of
wind
took
her
six
men
were
clinging
to
the
rail
to
keep
their
balance
staring
at
my
father
with
white
faces
while
sea
after
sea
swept
over
the
bulwarks
three
of
them
were
edging
toward
us
when
a
wave
caught
them
and
sent
them
sprawling
almost
to
his
feet
your
sword
henry
called
my
father
i
ducked
under
his
arm
and
stepped
out
on
the
swaying
deck
but
they
did
not
wait
ah
said
my
father
here
they
come
brutus
was
quicker
than
i
could
have
hoped
aiken
he
shouted
are
you
there
put
up
that
helm
or
we
be
drowned
put
up
that
helm
and
get
your
men
on
the
braces
hear
me
get
some
way
on
the
ship
a
hoarse
voice
bellowed
out
an
order
and
another
answered
good
said
my
father
it
was
a
nearer
thing
than
i
expected
you
can
hear
the
breakers
now
give
me
your
arm
my
son
a
lantern
brutus
xvi
and
so
it
was
over
over
almost
before
i
could
grasp
what
had
happened
the
light
that
brutus
was
holding
showed
me
the
white
walls
of
the
cabin
with
charts
nailed
upon
them
a
table
was
secured
to
the
deck
with
two
chairs
beside
it
these
two
lockers
and
a
berth
made
up
the
entire
furnishings
but
i
hardly
took
the
time
to
look
about
me
for
the
sight
of
my
father
gave
me
a
start
of
consternation
his
blue
coat
wringing
wet
with
sea
water
and
still
stamped
with
splashes
of
mud
was
half
ripped
from
his
shoulders
a
piece
of
lace
dangled
like
a
dirty
ribbon
from
his
neck
the
powder
in
his
hair
was
clotted
in
little
streaks
of
white
his
face
was
like
a
piece
of
yellow
parchment
his
left
arm
hung
limp
by
his
side
and
in
his
right
hand
he
still
clutched
an
empty
pistol
he
tossed
it
carelessly
to
the
floor
and
gripped
the
back
of
the
nearest
chair
staring
straight
at
mademoiselle
who
was
standing
opposite
his
cloak
still
about
her
slowly
he
inclined
his
head
and
when
he
looked
up
he
was
smiling
you
are
quite
all
right
my
lady
he
asked
anxiously
i
am
sorry
you
have
been
startled
believe
me
i
did
not
realize
this
little
surprise
would
be
waiting
for
us
it
was
careless
of
me
not
to
have
thought
very
careless
help
her
to
a
chair
henry
will
you
always
be
polite
she
cried
with
a
little
catch
in
her
voice
will
you
never
think
of
yourself
you
are
wounded
captain
and
what
are
you
staring
at
she
cried
turning
to
me
come
here
sir
and
help
me
with
his
coat
my
father
sank
into
a
chair
and
his
pale
lips
relaxed
pray
do
not
concern
yourself
he
replied
gravely
i
think
of
myself
mademoiselle
of
myself
always
and
now
i
am
very
fortunate
but
the
blue
from
my
coat
is
running
on
your
dress
brutus
will
see
to
me
mademoiselle
he
is
quite
used
to
it
the
rum
brutus
you
will
find
it
in
the
starboard
locker
but
it
was
mademoiselle
who
found
the
bottle
and
poured
him
a
glass
he
drank
it
quickly
again
if
you
please
he
said
and
a
shade
of
color
returned
to
his
cheeks
the
water
was
uncommonly
cold
tonight
how
much
better
the
sea
would
be
if
the
lord
had
mixed
in
a
dash
of
spirits
there
is
a
coat
in
the
locker
brutus
and
you
may
find
some
splints
and
a
piece
of
twine
i
fear
my
arm
is
broken
mademoiselle
had
taken
brutus
knife
and
was
cutting
away
his
sleeve
half
soaked
with
blood
he
sighed
and
smiled
a
little
sadly
so
sims
hit
me
after
all
he
said
it
must
be
age
i
was
not
so
clumsy
once
the
bandages
brutus
he
watched
us
with
a
mild
interest
and
then
his
mind
turned
to
other
matters
and
he
seemed
regardless
of
the
pain
we
caused
him
my
son
he
said
turning
to
me
you
made
a
statement
a
while
ago
which
interested
me
strangely
i
was
preoccupied
and
perhaps
i
did
not
hear
you
aright
but
it
seemed
you
said
i
should
know
what
had
become
of
your
mother
money
what
am
i
to
understand
by
that
you
are
hurt
sir
i
replied
why
go
into
a
painful
matter
now
we
have
kept
it
quiet
long
enough
only
three
people
knew
that
it
happened
and
one
of
them
is
dead
let
us
forget
it
father
i
am
willing
if
you
are
my
father
raised
his
eyebrows
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
pain
had
made
his
face
look
older
and
not
even
the
smile
on
his
lips
concealed
little
lines
of
suffering
and
what
are
we
to
forget
he
asked
surely
you
know
i
said
no
said
my
father
i
do
not
out
with
it
what
are
we
to
forget
was
he
still
acting
was
it
ever
possible
to
understand
him
perhaps
even
now
he
was
turning
the
situation
into
a
jest
and
smiling
to
himself
as
he
watched
me
and
yet
somehow
i
had
ceased
to
hate
him
do
you
mean
i
asked
that
you
never
took
it
slowly
my
father
body
straightened
in
his
chair
and
his
lips
drawn
tight
together
seemed
to
repress
an
exclamation
so
he
told
you
that
he
said
he
told
you
that
i
made
off
with
her
fortune
gad
but
he
was
clever
very
very
clever
he
paused
and
refilled
his
glass
and
held
it
steadily
before
him
his
voice
when
he
spoke
was
gentle
and
like
his
face
strung
taut
with
pain
no
wonder
she
never
sent
me
word
he
murmured
do
you
mean
i
asked
that
you
never
took
it
for
a
second
he
did
not
reply
only
looked
thoughtfully
before
him
as
if
he
saw
something
that
we
would
never
see
why
go
into
a
painful
matter
now
said
my
father
at
length
brutus
call
in
mr
aiken
he
lurched
into
the
cabin
a
half
a
minute
later
his
sea
cloak
was
gone
his
shirt
none
too
white
the
previous
afternoon
was
torn
and
scraped
as
though
it
had
scrubbed
the
deck
and
he
had
transferred
his
red
handkerchief
from
his
neck
to
his
head
so
that
his
tangled
hair
waved
around
it
like
some
wild
halo
his
heavy
hands
bruised
and
scarred
were
working
restlessly
at
his
sides
he
glanced
at
my
father
bandaged
arm
and
his
jaw
thrust
forward
i
warned
captain
he
cried
hoarsely
by
heaven
i
warned
you
i
says
will
break
loose
when
the
captain
climbs
aboard
and
it
did
so
help
me
there
was
fifteen
of
and
now
six
and
the
crew
has
in
the
forecastle
now
beating
sir
and
now
by
thunder
we
sling
overboard
that
would
be
a
pity
said
my
father
let
them
sail
with
us
i
shall
make
it
more
unpleasant
than
drowning
which
way
are
we
heading
ned
due
east
by
south
said
aiken
and
we
ready
to
show
heels
to
anything
i
can
drop
a
reef
off
now
if
you
want
it
good
said
my
father
put
on
all
the
sail
she
will
carry
aiken
grinned
i
thought
you
want
to
be
moving
he
said
quite
right
said
my
father
and
put
about
at
once
and
head
back
up
the
river
aiken
whistled
softly
well
i
be
damned
he
muttered
i
shall
want
ten
men
with
me
when
i
land
my
father
continued
done
my
best
to
keep
the
crew
out
of
my
private
affairs
but
now
it
seems
impossible
they
all
like
to
go
said
aiken
they
been
hoping
for
excitement
all
day
sir
ten
will
be
quite
enough
said
my
father
what
is
it
you
are
saying
mademoiselle
asked
sharply
quite
nothing
he
replied
except
that
we
are
going
back
his
arm
must
have
given
him
a
twinge
for
his
face
had
grown
very
white
surely
you
have
done
enough
she
said
and
her
voice
became
a
soft
entreaty
here
we
are
on
board
your
ship
if
i
told
you
i
was
not
entirely
sorry
would
you
not
go
on
if
i
told
you
captain
i
did
not
care
about
the
paper
my
father
waved
his
hand
in
graceful
denial
not
go
back
ah
mademoiselle
he
added
in
grave
rebuke
can
it
be
possible
after
all
in
spite
of
all
this
let
us
say
regrettable
melodrama
you
are
forgetting
i
am
the
villain
of
this
piece
and
not
a
very
pleasant
one
even
if
i
wished
my
lady
my
sense
of
hospitality
would
forbid
it
my
is
waiting
for
me
under
my
roof
tonight
and
i
could
not
leave
him
alone
he
would
be
disappointed
i
feel
sure
and
so
would
i
have
had
a
strenuous
evening
i
need
recreation
now
load
the
pistols
brutus
and
he
fell
silent
again
his
eyes
on
the
blank
wall
before
him
his
fingers
playing
with
his
glass
the
had
need
to
be
a
fast
ship
and
she
lived
up
to
requirements
the
easterly
wind
sent
her
lightly
before
it
cutting
sheer
and
quick
through
the
roughened
sea
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
of
white
linen
my
father
sat
motionless
apparently
passive
and
regardless
of
the
flight
of
time
it
was
only
when
we
veered
in
the
wind
and
orders
were
shouted
from
forward
that
he
looked
about
him
your
arm
brutus
he
said
on
deck
the
crew
was
at
work
about
the
long
boat
and
over
the
port
rail
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
i
could
see
our
house
with
a
light
burning
in
the
window
flickering
through
the
waving
branches
of
the
elms
that
half
hid
it
nearer
lay
our
wharf
a
black
silent
shadow
my
father
watched
without
a
word
the
anchor
chain
growled
out
a
sharp
complaint
and
the
anchor
splashed
into
the
tide
aiken
said
my
father
give
orders
to
get
under
way
in
half
an
hour
when
we
land
the
men
will
wait
at
the
wharf
and
be
ready
to
enter
the
house
when
you
call
them
you
shall
come
with
me
my
son
i
can
still
show
you
something
amusing
and
instructive
and
i
mademoiselle
demanded
shall
you
leave
me
here
he
seemed
to
hesitate
for
a
moment
earlier
in
the
evening
mademoiselle
he
replied
i
had
given
orders
for
my
sloop
to
carry
you
to
new
orleans
your
boxes
will
be
taken
from
the
house
and
you
will
be
taken
on
board
from
here
may
you
have
a
pleasant
journey
and
may
your
friends
be
well
when
you
arrive
you
mean
it
is
she
asked
and
her
voice
had
a
sound
that
reminded
me
of
tears
you
mean
we
shall
not
meet
again
he
bowed
low
over
her
hand
mademoiselle
will
be
relieved
to
know
we
shall
not
said
my
father
gravely
let
me
hope
you
may
always
have
more
pleasant
company
she
seemed
about
to
speak
again
but
she
did
not
instead
she
turned
silently
away
and
left
him
and
a
second
later
i
saw
her
disappear
in
the
shadow
of
the
ah
said
my
father
there
is
a
woman
for
you
my
son
in
the
side
pocket
of
my
coat
you
will
find
a
snuff
box
would
you
kindly
open
it
for
me
and
permit
me
to
take
a
pinch
and
you
perhaps
no
it
is
a
pleasant
sedative
he
took
a
step
nearer
the
rail
and
the
men
about
the
long
boat
stiffened
to
attention
get
them
into
the
boat
aiken
he
said
you
and
i
will
sit
in
the
stern
my
son
your
arm
brutus
so
stand
by
to
lower
away
directed
aiken
in
a
harsh
undertone
and
the
blocks
creaked
and
we
were
in
the
river
the
oars
had
been
muffled
so
that
we
moved
to
the
wharf
in
silence
land
the
men
and
tell
them
to
wait
said
my
father
you
shall
come
with
us
aiken
and
you
my
son
and
you
brutus
we
walked
silently
up
the
path
with
brutus
and
my
father
in
the
lead
once
he
paused
and
listened
and
then
proceeded
forward
i
believe
said
my
father
he
is
quite
alone
ha
he
had
stopped
dead
and
brutus
had
leapt
forward
crashing
into
a
dense
thicket
of
overgrown
bushes
put
up
your
pistol
ned
said
my
father
brutus
has
him
there
was
a
moment
silence
followed
by
a
faint
cry
bring
him
here
brutus
said
my
father
the
bushes
cracked
again
and
brutus
was
back
now
who
the
devil
may
you
be
inquired
my
father
striding
towards
the
figure
that
brutus
was
holding
and
then
he
paused
and
in
the
dark
i
fancied
he
was
reaching
for
his
coat
lapel
lunacy
thy
name
is
woman
said
my
father
softly
will
they
never
stay
where
they
are
placed
it
was
mademoiselle
whom
brutus
had
thrust
before
him
i
came
in
the
boat
she
stammered
brokenly
i
you
wanted
to
see
the
end
my
lady
my
father
inquired
surely
you
should
have
known
better
but
it
is
too
late
now
you
are
going
to
be
present
at
a
harrowing
scene
which
i
hoped
to
save
you
aiken
help
the
lady
over
the
path
and
we
proceeded
to
the
house
together
a
minute
later
we
made
our
way
over
the
rough
unkempt
grass
which
once
marked
our
brick
terrace
brutus
opened
the
door
and
we
were
in
the
dark
hall
lighted
by
a
square
of
candle
light
from
the
morning
room
he
paused
again
and
listened
and
then
strode
across
the
threshold
a
blaze
was
burning
high
in
the
morning
fireplace
and
six
candles
were
lighted
on
the
center
table
and
seated
before
it
examining
my
father
papers
were
my
uncle
jason
and
lawton
ha
cried
lawton
springing
to
his
feet
and
eyeing
my
father
intently
so
you
are
here
shelton
and
every
card
in
the
deck
he
paused
to
nod
and
rub
his
hands
yes
there
the
girl
and
there
the
boy
and
there
the
nigger
it
was
sims
idea
your
getting
on
the
boat
he
bright
as
a
trap
jason
i
told
you
he
was
my
father
sighed
a
little
sadly
he
was
indeed
he
admitted
my
uncle
surveyed
him
with
his
broadest
smile
and
his
eyes
twinkled
with
a
malign
amusement
that
was
not
wholly
pleasant
so
here
you
are
george
he
cried
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
shake
with
excitement
god
help
you
but
i
wo
or
your
son
either
no
or
the
lady
indeed
inquired
my
father
pray
go
on
jason
i
had
forgotten
you
were
diverting
or
is
it
one
of
your
latest
virtues
a
slight
crease
appeared
between
my
uncle
eyes
and
his
face
became
a
trifle
redder
so
you
still
are
jovial
he
said
i
admire
you
for
it
george
yes
i
admire
you
because
of
course
you
know
what
is
going
to
happen
to
you
george
and
to
your
son
also
perhaps
you
will
wipe
away
that
smirk
of
yours
when
a
french
firing
squad
backs
you
against
a
wall
my
father
adjusted
the
bandage
on
his
arm
and
smiled
but
his
eyes
had
become
bright
and
glassy
so
you
have
quite
decided
to
send
me
to
france
jason
he
inquired
pleasantly
of
course
i
suspected
it
from
the
first
i
knew
you
hated
me
and
naturally
my
son
i
knew
you
never
felt
the
same
after
our
little
falling
out
when
i
found
you
forging
what
am
i
saying
reading
the
letter
i
sent
to
aiken
gad
but
your
face
was
pasty
then
you
sly
dog
he
paused
and
took
a
step
toward
him
he
was
a
different
man
when
he
continued
it
seemed
as
though
some
resistance
in
him
was
breaking
down
as
though
the
years
of
repression
were
falling
away
a
hot
dull
red
had
come
into
his
cheeks
and
burned
there
like
a
fever
his
whole
body
trembled
shaken
by
some
emotion
which
i
could
not
fathom
his
voice
grew
sharp
and
discordant
his
words
hot
and
triumphant
almost
as
pasty
as
when
you
challenged
me
to
produce
those
damned
bales
of
fur
do
you
remember
jason
the
party
here
at
this
house
the
music
the
flowers
oh
they
were
all
there
and
of
course
i
had
put
the
shavings
on
my
boat
you
could
prove
it
and
you
could
too
lawton
do
you
remember
and
you
could
swear
to
it
and
you
could
swear
i
had
cheated
you
before
that
i
had
stolen
your
card
money
oh
you
caught
me
you
brought
the
wolf
to
bay
and
drew
the
sword
of
justice
lawton
half
started
from
his
seat
be
still
shelton
he
snapped
or
i
have
them
gag
you
my
father
clenched
his
fist
drew
a
deep
breath
and
his
voice
lost
its
strident
note
ah
lawton
lawton
he
said
will
you
always
be
impetuous
will
you
never
be
subtle
but
always
crude
always
the
true
rough
diamond
with
the
keen
edge
no
you
wo
gag
me
lawton
and
so
you
will
send
me
to
france
jason
and
my
son
too
criminals
to
justice
it
is
thoughtful
of
you
to
think
of
justice
but
tell
me
jason
is
it
i
you
hate
or
my
wife
money
that
you
love
tell
me
jason
i
have
often
wondered
my
uncle
face
also
became
a
flaming
red
the
veins
stood
out
on
his
temples
he
tried
to
speak
but
his
words
choked
him
sims
shouted
lawton
sims
take
him
out
take
him
away
my
father
raised
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
and
sighed
ah
lawton
he
said
is
it
possible
that
you
did
not
know
it
can
it
be
that
you
do
not
understand
poor
sims
is
dead
lawton
a
brave
man
but
not
of
good
physique
the
evening
was
quite
too
much
for
him
do
not
take
it
so
hard
man
we
all
must
die
you
among
the
rest
you
should
have
known
me
better
lawton
you
should
have
known
i
would
not
allow
myself
to
be
taken
prisoner
what
shouted
lawton
what
the
devil
are
you
then
the
scene
appeared
to
move
my
father
for
he
sighed
again
and
paused
the
better
to
enjoy
it
only
a
poor
man
he
said
only
a
poor
chattel
of
the
lord
a
poor
frail
jug
that
has
gone
too
often
to
the
well
a
poor
man
of
a
blackened
reputation
who
has
been
set
upon
by
spies
of
france
and
threatened
in
his
own
house
but
who
has
managed
to
escape
and
his
voice
became
sharp
and
hard
take
lawton
pistol
ned
there
fell
a
moment
silence
in
the
room
while
my
father
a
little
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
us
stared
fixedly
into
my
uncle
eyes
set
upon
by
spies
he
said
persecuted
and
driven
it
has
set
me
thinking
jason
as
i
walked
back
here
tonight
i
still
was
thinking
and
can
you
imagine
what
was
on
my
mind
it
was
you
jason
you
and
lawton
and
as
i
thought
of
you
my
mind
fell
as
it
naturally
would
on
holy
things
and
a
piece
of
the
scripture
came
back
to
me
think
of
it
jason
a
piece
of
the
holy
writ
would
you
care
to
hear
it
my
father
paused
to
adjust
a
wrinkle
in
his
coat
and
then
his
voice
became
solemn
and
sonorous
and
he
spoke
the
words
with
metrical
precision
everything
said
my
father
there
is
a
season
and
a
time
to
every
purpose
under
the
heaven
a
time
to
be
born
and
a
time
to
die
he
paused
long
enough
to
nod
from
one
to
the
other
time
to
plant
and
a
time
to
pluck
up
that
which
is
planted
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
again
and
placed
the
tips
of
his
fingers
together
and
time
to
kill
he
concluded
gently
his
words
died
softly
away
in
the
quiet
room
i
have
often
thought
of
that
passage
he
continued
many
and
many
a
night
i
have
repeated
it
to
myself
under
stars
and
under
roof
and
sometimes
i
have
prayed
jason
oh
yes
we
all
pray
sometimes
sometimes
i
have
prayed
for
the
time
to
come
the
red
had
gone
out
of
my
uncle
face
and
lawton
was
sitting
rigid
in
his
chair
his
eyes
glued
on
the
slender
figure
before
him
and
now
said
my
father
in
a
tone
that
was
as
near
to
the
pious
as
i
ever
heard
him
utter
now
it
is
here
and
i
thank
thee
lord
good
god
gasped
lawton
in
a
voice
that
rose
only
a
little
above
a
whisper
do
you
mean
to
murder
us
my
father
still
stood
motionless
but
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
had
relapsed
to
its
old
genial
courtesy
what
a
word
for
gentlemen
to
use
he
exclaimed
in
polite
rebuke
murder
you
of
course
not
lawton
i
am
simply
about
to
propose
a
game
that
is
all
an
exciting
little
game
only
one
of
us
will
die
clear
the
large
table
of
the
papers
ned
toss
them
on
the
floor
xvii
of
all
the
people
in
the
room
my
father
alone
retained
his
my
uncle
cheeks
had
sagged
and
perspiration
made
them
moist
and
shiny
and
lawton
seemed
bent
and
as
wrinkled
as
though
he
had
aged
a
dozen
years
brutus
said
my
father
place
the
pistols
on
the
table
the
ones
i
gave
you
as
we
came
on
shore
side
by
side
brutus
the
silver
mountings
look
well
against
the
dark
mahogany
do
they
not
cheer
you
jason
and
now
brutus
a
pack
of
cards
from
the
bookshelves
it
will
be
a
pretty
game
lawton
as
pretty
a
game
as
you
have
ever
played
good
god
what
are
you
going
to
do
shelton
stammered
lawton
and
he
raised
a
trembling
hand
to
his
forehead
you
grow
interested
my
father
inquired
i
thought
you
would
lawton
and
now
stand
up
and
listen
and
you
too
jason
stand
up
you
dog
stand
up
the
world
is
still
rolling
are
you
ill
and
indeed
my
uncle
seemed
incapable
of
moving
perhaps
you
would
prefer
to
sit
said
my
father
politely
i
have
known
people
who
find
it
steadies
them
to
fire
across
the
table
while
seated
in
a
chair
your
attention
then
and
i
will
tell
you
the
game
on
the
table
are
three
pistols
one
of
them
is
loaded
the
question
is
which
they
are
all
made
by
the
same
smith
and
yet
one

minutes

where

are
while
i

over
here
brutus
give
the
cards
to
mr
lawton
my
father
smiled
and
bowed
from
his
manner
it
might
have
been
some
treat
he
was
proposing
some
pleasant
bit
of
sport
that
all
knew
ended
in
hilarity
still
smiling
he
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
and
then
towards
mademoiselle
and
me
as
though
seeking
our
approbation
even
with
his
bandaged
arm
and
weather
stained
clothes
he
carried
himself
with
a
gaiety
and
grace
always
trust
in
chance
my
son
he
said
my
uncle
leaned
forward
and
drew
his
hand
across
his
lips
his
eyes
blank
and
staring
and
if
you
get
the
pistol
he
demanded
hoarsely
in
that
case
replied
my
father
your
troubles
will
be
over
jason
pray
rest
assured
i
shall
attend
to
that
and
then
when
that
is
finished
brutus
shall
bring
two
other
pistols
and
lawton
and
i
shall
draw
again
lawton
grasped
the
cards
uncertainly
you
give
us
the
first
two
choices
he
demanded
the
host
naturally
is
last
said
my
father
one
must
always
be
polite
then
you
mad
said
lawton
bluntly
come
shelton
step
outside
and
we
finish
it
on
the
lawn
and
i
should
undoubtedly
kill
you
said
my
father
pray
do
not
tempt
me
lawton
i
tell
you
you
mad
said
lawton
i
have
been
told
that
once
before
today
said
my
father
and
still
i
am
not
sure
i
have
often
pictured
this
little
scene
lawton
we
have
only
one
thing
to
add
to
it
now
tell
me
if
i
mad
my
father
had
reached
up
to
his
throat
and
was
fumbling
at
his
collar
when
he
drew
away
his
hand
something
glittered
between
his
fingers
silently
he
placed
his
closed
fist
on
the
table
opened
it
and
there
was
the
gold
locket
which
i
had
perceived
in
the
morning
he
pressed
the
spring
and
the
lid
flew
free
lawton
leaned
forward
glanced
at
the
picture
inside
and
then
drew
back
very
straight
and
pale
come
lawton
said
my
father
gravely
which
is
it
now
madness
or
an
appeal
for
justice
and
retribution
with
her
picture
on
the
table
lawton
i
have
wondered
i
have
often
wondered
lawton
who
will
be
the
lucky
man
to
draw
the
loaded
pistol
let
us
leave
it
there
where
we
can
watch
it
before
we
fire
i
have
often
thought
that
she
would
like
it
so
and
now
he
nodded
again
and
smiled
surely
you
will
oblige
me
shuffle
the
cards
lawton
and
let
the
game
go
on
lawton
bit
his
lower
lip
fingered
the
cards
uncertainly
and
then
tossed
them
in
the
fire
come
come
lawton
said
my
father
sharply
where
are
your
manners
surely
you
are
not
afraid
not
afraid
of
a
picture
lawton
no
said
lawton
i
am
not
afraid
ah
said
my
father
i
thought
i
knew
you
better
another
pack
of
cards
for
lawton
brutus
let
us
trust
lawton
that
these
will
suit
you
better
you
misunderstand
me
said
lawton
simply
i
am
not
going
to
play
not
going
to
play
exclaimed
my
father
raising
his
eyebrows
slowly
lawton
shook
his
head
you
are
far
too
generous
shelton
he
said
if
you
shot
me
where
i
stand
you
would
only
be
giving
me
my
fair
deserts
if
i
had
been
in
your
place
and
you
in
mine
both
you
and
jason
would
have
been
dead
ten
seconds
after
i
had
entered
the
door
do
be
a
fool
lawton
cried
my
father
raising
his
hand
think
what
you
are
saying
i
have
thought
he
replied
sharply
the
game
is
over
shelton
and
i
know
when
i
am
beaten
we
have
not
got
the
paper
jason
and
you
remember
what
i
said
if
you
failed
to
get
it
i
should
tell
the
whole
story
and
now
by
heaven
i
will
every
man
in
town
will
know
it
tomorrow
morning
i
told
you
i
would
be
shut
out
of
this
business
and
i
mean
it
jason
on
my
father
face
came
something
closer
to
blank
astonishment
than
i
had
ever
seen
there
something
in
the
situation
was
puzzling
him
and
for
the
moment
he
seemed
unable
to
cope
with
it
lawton
he
said
slowly
shuffle
those
cards
or
i
shoot
you
where
you
stand
lawton
placed
the
cards
on
the
table
and
adjusted
them
thoughtfully
no
you
wo
he
replied
i
know
you
better
than
that
you
would
never
draw
a
weapon
on
any
man
unless
he
had
an
equal
chance
and
i
have
shelton
i
had
stepped
forward
beside
him
was
there
someone
else
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
wretched
business
was
it
possible
that
my
father
had
no
hand
in
it
a
glance
at
lawton
answered
a
half
a
hundred
questions
which
were
darting
through
my
mind
and
my
father
was
still
staring
in
a
baffled
way
eyeing
lawton
in
silent
wonder
so
he
said
you
think
i
forgive
you
is
it
possible
you
are
relying
on
my
christian
spirit
no
said
lawton
i
do
not
ask
you
to
forgive
me
i
am
saying
i
have
stopped
that
is
all
stopped
do
you
understand
me
i
should
nave
stopped
when
jason
commissioned
me
to
kill
your
son
i
should
have
if
this
affair
with
france
was
not
beginning
even
then
the
business
sickened
me
what
did
i
care
about
the
money
he
stole
from
her
i
did
not
want
her
money
what
did
i
care
if
the
boy
suspected
you
had
not
stolen
it
but
that
jason
had
it
all
the
time
i
could
have
killed
him
because
he
had
some
slight
glimmerings
of
sense
a
dozen
dim
suspicions
clashed
suddenly
together
into
fact
i
looked
sharply
at
my
father
he
was
nodding
with
some
faint
suspicion
of
amusement
and
so
you
did
not
he
said
gently
your
scruples
do
you
credit
after
all
it
was
just
as
well
said
lawton
i
thought
the
news
your
son
was
attacked
would
fetch
you
over
jason
did
his
best
to
hush
it
up
but
i
knew
you
would
suspect
and
you
know
what
it
would
have
meant
to
me
if
i
could
have
sent
you
back
to
france
and
yet
for
some
reason
my
father
was
strangely
ill
at
ease
like
someone
detected
in
a
falsehood
he
looked
restlessly
about
him
for
the
moment
his
adroitness
seemed
to
have
left
him
he
made
a
helpless
little
gesture
of
annoyance
you
say
you
have
stopped
inquired
my
father
then
why
not
do
so
lawton
and
stop
talking
do
you
think
what
you
say
interests
me
do
you
think
i
do
not
know
the
whole
damnable
business
without
your
raking
it
up
again
why
should
jason
have
wished
to
be
rid
of
me
except
for
her
money
why
should
you
have
helped
him
except
at
least
it
was
not
for
money
lawton
but
lawton
did
not
heed
my
father
voice
his
glance
had
come
to
rest
again
upon
the
locket
on
the
table
and
the
hard
lines
about
his
mouth
had
vanished
and
she
never
spoke
to
me
never
looked
at
me
again
he
said
my
father
started
and
looked
at
him
quickly
lawton
groaned
my
uncle
are
you
out
of
your
mind
lawton
turned
sharp
around
and
faced
him
with
a
scowl
i
told
you
he
said
harshly
i
told
you
to
get
me
the
paper
and
i
told
you
what
would
happen
if
you
did
not
and
it
is
happening
already
jason
i
am
going
to
tell
the
story
my
uncle
moved
convulsively
to
his
feet
and
his
voice
was
sharp
and
malignant
do
you
suppose
anyone
will
believe
you
he
cried
do
you
fancy
they
will
take
your
word
against
mine
we
will
try
it
said
lawton
there
are
still
people
who
wonder
why
shelton
stooped
to
the
thing
you
accused
him
of
we
certainly
will
try
it
and
if
you
do
said
my
uncle
i
will
show
it
was
she
who
did
it
that
it
was
she
who
urged
him
on
i
tell
them
hear
me
i
tell
them
and
they
take
my
word
for
it
they
take
my
word
god
cried
lawton
so
that
the
reason
so
that
the
trick
you
played
you
dog
if
i
had
only
known
his
face
had
become
blanched
with
passion
and
my
uncle
staggered
back
before
his
upraised
hand
but
lawton
did
not
strike
for
a
moment
he
stood
rigid
and
when
he
spoke
he
had
regained
his
you
will
never
tell
it
jason
he
said
slowly
and
then
he
turned
to
my
father
and
inclined
his
head
very
gravely
and
his
voice
was
no
longer
harsh
and
strident
i
often
wondered
why
you
left
her
so
he
said
and
why
you
did
not
face
it
you
feared
her
name
might
be
dragged
in
the
mire
because
he
threatened
to
bring
her
into
that
miserable
business
you
never
raised
a
hand
i
always
knew
you
were
a
gentleman
but
i
did
not
know
you
were
don
quixote
de
la
mancha
for
the
first
time
since
the
two
had
spoken
my
father
moved
he
leaned
across
the
table
picked
up
the
locket
very
gently
and
placed
it
in
his
coat
his
eyes
rested
on
lawton
and
returned
his
bow
rubbish
said
my
father
one
liar
is
bad
enough
but
why
listen
to
two
we
will
leave
her
name
out
of
the
conversation
perhaps
i
had
other
reasons
for
going
away
did
they
ever
occur
to
you
lawton
perhaps
for
instance
i
was
sick
of
the
whole
business
did
you
ever
think
i
might
have
found
it
pleasant
to
leave
so
uncongenial
an
atmosphere
that
i
was
relieved
delighted
at
the
opportunity
to
leave
lying
relatives
and
friends
who
turned
their
backs
faugh
i
have
kept
the
matter
quiet
for
fifteen
years
merely
because
i
was
too
indolent
to
stand
against
it
i
was
too
glad
to
see
the
cards
fall
as
they
did
to
call
for
a
new
deal
there
i
was
tied
up
to
a
family
of
sniveling
hypocrites
look
at
jason
look
at
him
who
would
have
been
glad
to
get
away
and
he
bowed
to
my
uncle
ironically
positively
i
was
glad
to
hear
the
crash
well
i
said
am
a
thief
since
it
pleases
you
to
think
so
thieves
at
least
are
a
more
interesting
society
and
i
have
found
them
so
lawton
not
only
more
interesting
but
more
honest
but
somehow
there
was
no
ring
of
conviction
to
his
words
his
voice
seemed
unable
to
assume
its
old
cynicism
and
his
face
had
lost
its
former
placidity
it
had
suddenly
become
old
and
careworn
pain
and
regret
sharp
and
poignant
were
reflected
there
his
eyes
seemed
strained
and
tired
the
corners
of
his
mouth
had
drooped
and
his
body
too
was
less
erect
and
resolute
something
had
been
broken
for
a
moment
his
mask
and
his
mantle
had
dropped
where
he
could
not
find
them
and
then
as
he
stood
looking
ahead
of
him
at
the
shadows
he
ended
his
speech
in
a
way
that
had
no
logic
and
no
relation
to
the
rest
if
she
had
only
said
she
did
not
believe
them
why
did
she
not
say
it
and
then
he
squared
his
shoulders
and
tried
again
to
smile
but
what
difference
does
it
make
now
the
road
has
turned
too
long
ago
for
us
to
face
about
she
never
spoke
to
me
never
looked
at
me
again
repeated
lawton
my
father
fist
crashed
down
on
the
table
but
when
he
spoke
his
words
were
precise
and
devoid
of
all
emotion
and
why
the
devil
should
she
he
answered
we
are
not
questioning
her
taste
and
you
jason
he
added
no
one
will
doubt
your
word
or
believe
this
little
romance
do
you
wonder
why
they
will
never
have
the
opportunity
brutus
take
them
down
to
the
boat
brutus
stepped
forward
and
laid
a
hand
on
my
uncle
shoulder
he
shrank
back
george
he
cried
you
shall
have
the
money
i
swear
it
george
i
have
wronged
you
but
yes
said
my
father
i
shall
have
the
money
and
you
too
jason
i
shall
have
everything
take
them
along
brutus
and
they
left
the
room
in
silence
while
my
father
watched
them
thoughtfully
and
arranged
the
lapel
on
his
coat
ned
said
my
father
the
rum
decanter
is
over
on
the
bookshelves
good
god
where
is
he
going
for
aiken
had
darted
into
the
hall
and
was
running
up
the
staircase
is
the
man
mad
is
my
father
stopped
and
was
looking
at
the
table
i
followed
his
glance
and
started
involuntarily
there
had
been
three
pistols
lying
side
by
side
on
the
polished
mahogany
and
now
there
were
only
two
my
son
said
my
father
the
rum
decanter
is
on
the
bookshelves
the
glasses
a
shout
from
the
hall
interrupted
him
captain
aiken
was
roaring
damme
here
another
of
you
would
bite
me
would
you
hell
fire
if
i
do
cut
your
gullet
open
what
an
evening
we
are
having
to
be
sure
said
my
father
turning
to
the
doorway
aiken
was
pushing
a
man
before
him
into
the
room
and
holding
a
dirk
at
his
throat
ives
shrieked
mademoiselle
she
is
right
said
my
father
it
is
ives
de
blanzy
i
had
forgotten
you
had
sent
him
to
the
house
the
man
aiken
was
holding
wrenched
himself
free
and
sprang
forward
shaking
a
fist
in
my
father
face
forgotten
he
shouted
was
it
you
who
sent
me
here
and
had
me
tied
in
the
cellar
and
left
me
chewing
at
the
rope
and
set
this
pirate
on
me
mother
of
god
captain
shelton
is
this
a
joke
you
are
playing
only
a
very
regrettable
error
said
my
father
a
mistake
of
my
son
pray
calm
yourself
ives
it
is
quite
all
right
my
son
this
is
mademoiselle
brother
her
brother
i
cried
and
who
the
devil
did
you
think
i
was
he
walked
slowly
towards
me
have
you
no
perceptions
he
would
have
continued
further
if
my
father
had
not
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
gently
ives
he
said
you
know
i
would
not
treat
you
so
give
him
the
paper
my
son
he
is
the
one
who
should
have
it
i
stared
at
my
father
in
blank
astonishment
but
before
i
could
speak
he
had
continued
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
what
was
the
use
of
all
this
comedy
why
should
i
have
deceived
you
i
was
only
running
true
to
form
my
son
which
is
the
only
thing
left
to
do
when
life
tastes
bitter
do
you
not
understand
but
you
do
not
your
palate
is
unused
yet
to
gall
and
wormwood
only
wait
my
son
he
raised
his
hand
slowly
as
though
tilting
an
imaginary
glass
to
his
lips
only
wait
they
will
offer
you
the
cup
some
day
and
we
were
always
heavy
drinkers
pray
god
that
you
will
stand
it
with
a
better
grace
than
i
that
you
will
forget
the
sting
and
rancor
of
it
and
not
carry
it
with
you
through
the
years
his
eyes
grew
brighter
as
he
spoke
and
his
features
were
suddenly
mobile
and
expressive
she
said
she
believed
it
she
threw
their
lies
in
my
face
she
lashed
me
with
them
and
my
blood
was
hotter
then
than
now
she
would
not
listen
and
i
forgot
it
was
a
woman
way
how
was
i
to
know
it
was
only
impulse
i
ask
you
how
was
i
to
know
was
i
a
man
to
crawl
back
and
ask
her
forgiveness
to
offer
some
miserable
excuse
she
would
not
credit
and
you
brought
into
manhood
to
believe
i
was
a
thief
was
i
to
stand
your
flinging
back
my
denial
was
i
to
pose
as
the
picture
of
injured
innocence
and
beg
you
the
favor
of
believing
i
would
not
have
expected
it
of
you
my
son
by
heaven
it
would
have
stuck
in
my
throat
i
had
gone
my
way
too
long
and
the
draught
still
tasted
bitter
it
burned
burned
as
i
never
thought
it
would
again
when
i
first
saw
you
standing
watching
me
indeed
it
is
only
now
that
its
taste
has
wholly
gone
only
now
that
i
see
what
i
have
done
now
when
the
lights
are
dim
and
it
is
too
late
to
begin
again
he
stopped
and
squared
his
shoulders
and
the
harshness
left
his
voice
you
understand
i
hope
he
added
give
him
the
paper
henry
and
he
nodded
towards
ives
de
blanzy
i
drew
it
from
my
pocket
and
handed
it
to
him
in
silence
now
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
said
ives
de
blanzy
harshly
this
is
not
the
paper
the
cursed
thing
is
blank
inside
my
father
snatched
it
from
his
hands
blank
he
muttered
blank
clean
as
the
driven
snow
is
it
possible
i
have
failed
in
everything
mademoiselle
had
moved
forward
and
touched
his
arm
he
glanced
at
her
quickly
and
slowly
his
frown
vanished
naturally
it
is
blank
captain
said
mademoiselle
i
took
the
real
one
from
you
this
morning
when
you
left
it
in
your
volume
of
rabelais
i
thought
that
you
might
place
it
there
i
am
sorry
captain
sorry
now
that
you
made
me
take
you
seriously
the
paper
dropped
from
his
fingers
and
fluttered
to
the
floor
but
strangely
enough
he
did
not
appear
chagrined
his
gallantry
was
back
with
him
again
and
with
it
all
his
courtesy
ah
mademoiselle
he
said
i
should
have
known
you
better
will
there
always
be
a
woman
where
there
is
trouble
and
you
have
not
made
me
hate
you
captain
mademoiselle
continued
but
you
my
son
said
my
father
you
understand
i
felt
his
glance
but
i
could
not
meet
it
yes
i
said
i
understand
good
said
my
father
here
comes
brutus
and
now
we
shall
have
our
rum
i
understand
i
said
and
my
voice
seemed
unsteady
that
you
are
a
very
brave
and
upright
gentleman
the
devil
cried
my
father
and
then
he
started
and
whirled
toward
the
door
ned
ives
he
called
sharply
what
the
devil
is
going
on
outside
and
the
three
of
them
had
darted
into
the
hall
clear
and
distinct
through
the
quiet
night
had
come
a
shriek
and
the
report
of
a
pistol
i
started
to
follow
them
but
mademoiselle
had
laid
a
hand
on
my
arm
and
was
pointing
to
the
table
i
lifted
first
one
and
then
the
other
of
the
two
pistols
that
were
lying
there
neither
was
primed
neither
was
loaded
the
third
one
she
said
quietly
lawton
took
no
no
she
added
as
i
started
toward
the
door
stay
here
monsieur
it
is
not
your
affair
xviii
she
still
stood
looking
at
the
pistols
on
the
table
was
she
thinking
as
i
was
of
the
irony
and
the
comedy
and
the
tragedy
that
had
been
so
strangely
blended
in
the
last
hour
slowly
she
turned
and
faced
me
her
slender
fingers
tugging
aimlessly
at
her
handkerchief
for
a
moment
her
eyes
met
mine
then
she
looked
away
and
the
color
had
deepened
in
her
cheeks
so
said
mademoiselle
it
is
almost
over
are
you
not
glad
monsieur
that
it
is
finished
the
wick
of
a
candle
had
dropped
to
the
wax
and
was
spluttering
fitfully
mechanically
i
moved
to
fix
it
no
i
said
i
am
not
glad
not
glad
surely
you
are
glad
it
has
ended
so
surely
you
are
glad
your
father
no
i
said
and
my
voice
was
so
much
louder
than
i
had
intended
that
the
sound
of
it
in
the
quiet
room
made
me
stop
abruptly
she
looked
up
at
me
a
little
startled
at
least
monsieur
is
frank
she
said
do
you
know
have
you
thought
that
you
are
the
only
one
of
us
who
has
been
wholly
so
who
has
not
had
something
to
conceal
pray
go
on
monsieur
it
is
pleasant
to
hear
someone
who
is
frank
again
continue
you
must
be
glad
for
something
every
cloud
must
have
do
you
not
say
a
silver
lining
if
it
is
not
your
father
surely
you
are
glad
about
me
she
made
a
graceful
little
gesture
of
interrogation
come
come
she
went
on
you
are
not
yourself
tonight
never
have
i
seen
you
look
so
black
think
monsieur
the
men
are
on
deck
and
the
wind
is
fair
soon
i
shall
be
going
soon
you
will
forget
no
i
said
mademoiselle
is
mistaken
i
shall
not
forget
nor
i
she
said
gravely
i
wonder
monsieur
if
you
understand
but
you
can
not
understand
what
it
has
meant
to
me
i
have
tried
to
tell
you
once
before
but
you
are
cold
like
your
father
i
have
seen
many
men
who
have
said
gallant
things
but
only
you
two
of
all
i
know
have
done
them
i
have
done
nothing
i
said
you
know
i
have
done
nothing
but
it
has
not
been
your
fault
she
answered
and
was
it
nothing
to
protect
a
stranger
from
a
strange
land
when
you
had
nothing
to
gain
from
it
and
everything
to
lose
mademoiselle
forgets
i
said
that
i
had
nothing
to
lose
it
was
lost
already
then
surely
she
replied
lightly
surely
you
must
be
glad
i
am
going
you
know
better
than
that
i
answered
ah
mademoiselle
do
you
not
see
i
hoped
i
might
show
you
that
i
did
not
always
blunder
i
hoped
i
might
show
you
the
words
seemed
to
choke
me
ah
mademoiselle
i
cried
if
i
had
only
been
on
the
stairs
at
blanzy
blanzy
she
echoed
pray
what
has
blanzy
to
do
with
you
and
me
even
now
i
do
not
know
what
made
me
speak
save
that
she
was
going
the
very
ticking
of
the
clock
was
bringing
the
moment
nearer
and
there
she
was
staring
at
me
half
puzzled
and
half
frightened
it
seemed
already
as
though
she
were
further
away
do
you
not
see
i
said
it
is
not
like
you
not
to
understand
nor
is
it
very
kind
how
can
i
see
you
go
and
be
glad
how
can
i
be
glad
you
love
my
father
mon
dieu
she
exclaimed
suddenly
startled
your
father
i
care
for
your
father
i
bowed
in
quick
contrition
mademoiselle
i
said
i
fear
i
have
been
very
rude
and
as
usual
very
gauche
i
beg
you
to
forgive
me
but
i
tell
you
she
cried
i
do
not
love
him
i
bowed
again
in
silence
you
do
not
believe
me
mademoiselle
may
rest
assured
i
replied
gently
that
i
understand
perfectly
you
i
started
at
her
sudden
vexation
started
to
find
that
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
you
understand
quite
nothing
never
have
i
seen
anyone
so
cruel
so
stupid
mademoiselle
i
said
i
have
been
awkward
but
forgive
me
the
cabin
of
the
where
you
asked
him
to
sail
on
and
when
you
bade
him
recall
what
he
said
on
the
stairs
at
blanzy
your
pardon
i
have
been
very
blunt
and
now
she
was
regarding
me
with
blank
astonishment
surely
he
told
you
she
murmured
surely
he
told
you
what
the
marquis
had
intended
then
she
stopped
confused
and
silent
mon
dieu
she
exclaimed
suddenly
but
he
has
told
you
nothing
no
i
said
dully
he
has
been
most
discreet
but
does
it
make
any
real
difference
mademoiselle
except
that
i
know
now
that
the
marquis
was
a
man
of
very
keen
discrimination
are
you
mad
cried
mademoiselle
i
tell
you
it
is
not
your
father
i
tell
you
i
her
face
had
grown
scarlet
she
bowed
her
head
and
tugged
more
violently
than
ever
at
the
corner
of
her
handkerchief
mademoiselle
i
said
unsteadily
mademoiselle
what
was
it
he
told
you
at
blanzy
i
can
not
tell
you
if
you
do
not
know
she
answered
indeed
i
can
not
but
you
will
i
cried
you
will
mademoiselle
you
must
mademoiselle
her
eyes
had
met
mine
again
they
were
breaking
in
the
door
she
began
and
he
was
going
down
to
meet
them
i
told
him
i
told
him
to
go
to
leave
me
and
take
the
paper
he
said
she
paused
again
watching
me
in
vague
embarrassment
he
said
he
be
damned
if
he
would
monsieur
he
said
he
would
do
what
the
marquis
had
directed
if
he
had
to
swing
for
it
that
he
would
take
the
paper
and
me
to
america
that
i
mon
dieu
do
you
not
know
what
he
said
can
you
not
guess
he
said
that
i
was
to
marry
his
son
a
smile
suddenly
played
about
her
lips
and
i
told
him
she
continued
breathlessly
i
told
him
i
be
damned
if
i
would
monsieur
that
neither
he
nor
the
marquis
would
make
me
marry
a
man
i
did
not
know
much
less
a
son
of
his
and
when
you
asked
him
to
recall
it
mademoiselle
when
you
asked
him
to
recall
it
did
you
mean
tell
me
mademoiselle
ah
she
whispered
but
it
is
too
soon
and
you
are
too
rough
monsieur
i
beg
of
you
be
careful
besides
someone
is
coming
and
then
i
heard
a
soft
footstep
behind
me
huh
said
brutus
i
go
tell
the
captain
no
it
is
all
right
i
tell
the
captain
he
is
happy
it
will
please
him
huh
his
long
speech
seemed
to
have
taken
his
breath
for
he
paused
grinning
broadly
huh
he
said
finally
lawton
shoot
jason
shoot
him
with
pistol
off
the
table
the
captain
is
happy
but
before
brutus
could
turn
to
go
my
father
was
in
the
doorway
smoothing
the
bandage
on
his
arm
let
us
say
relieved
brutus
he
answered
smoothly
it
is
dangerous
ever
to
use
superlatives
then
he
glanced
from
mademoiselle
to
me
and
his
smile
broadened
very
much
relieved
he
said
and
yet
and
yet
i
still
feel
thirsty
the
rum
decanter
brutus
